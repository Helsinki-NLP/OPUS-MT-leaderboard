Members of the Galles Assembly worried about "Identify them as Muppets"
Several members of the Assembly expressed their consternation before the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Galles Parliament).
This issue has emerged from the plan to change the name of the Assembly by the Gallesian Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all different political parties have shown their concern that this measure can become a reason for joke.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said that in its party he was concerned that MWP "required with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not galles: In galles, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly commented that the whole of its party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
On the other hand, a conservative Galles member claimed that his group was "open" before the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it is necessary to say that the letter "w" in gallery is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in English Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the Assembly responsible for drafting the legal deletion to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualifying to appoint members of the Assembly will naturally take into account their own members."
The 2017 Government Act of Gal·les grants the Assembly of Gal·les all power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with extensive support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Gallean Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the Assembly, although the committee was defeated by "Members of the Galles parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one who received wider support for public consultation.
As it seems, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to achieve a consensus may assume a whole deceased for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present legal deletion on changes in weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly shall hold the final vote on their name during the debate relating to legislation.
Macedonians will vote in referendum on the change of their country's name
Citizens will choose Sunday whether they want or not to change the name of their country by the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasts decades with Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its north road represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, against the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that change of name is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's campaigns stop sounding: the difficulties of Harlem churches
"History, the older people with whom I have spoken say there was a bar and a church at each corner," said Adams.
“Today, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have another way to socialize today,” she said.
“The bars have already ceased to be that kind of staying salts for the neighborhood where people were going regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets does not last as much as their leaders predict "when or later they return to the place where they came out."
Churches, added, could eventually be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people that will not be helpful for the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people buying condominiums in these buildings will be of white race,” he says, “and so they will accelerate the closing of all churches, because it is unlikely that most people who are moving to these condominiums will be members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Church of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The White Methodist congregation that had been there originally departed during the 1930s.
A black congregation nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black assembly led by reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to 125th street retailers, one of Harlem's main commercial streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when reverend Johnson's fellas planned to rebuild it, it was then when they charged the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson, and his successor to St. Martin's church, described him proudly as "the poor people's campaigns".
The expert who made the carrillo sound in July described it differently: “A cultural treasure” and “An irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also observed that it was the world's first cartoon that was played by a black race musician Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest cartoon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the Laic leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The council, the director organ of the parochie, composed of Laic leaders, wrote to the diocese last July, expressing her concern that the diocese "supposed to transmit the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the contracting of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent it.
Some happy people have complained about lack of transparency by the diocese.
A thirteen-year-old kid was injured while looking for lagostes in California
A taro attacked and wounded a 13-year-old child on Saturday while injuring to search for lagoses in California on the first day of the lagoses season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel at the KSWB-TV in San Diego, he took a half an hour busing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they stayed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that first he thought it was the joy of taking a lagosta, but then he realized that he called 'M'han mossegat!'
They've moved me!"
I had the whole keyboard stretched out,” Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
"Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, 'There is a tavern in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was enrolled in a severe state.
It is not known what the species of tauro is responsible for the attack.
In a press wheel, rescuer Larry Giles commented that he worked for a few weeks that had detected a bush in the area, but it was decided that that species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper area of the tors.
The authorities closed access to the beaches for 48 hours from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami's to Ecinitas for investigations and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of tauro in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, to the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a variety of beauty products in the style of large stores occupied with specialized employees.
These big passports are just a portion of a significant investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves around £2800 million and continues to grow while fashion and home products sectors remain behind, and will be tested at 11 stores from all over the country to expand to more stores the next year
Investing in beauty products is a product of the supermarket's avidity to take advantage of the space in its performances previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offer to offer up to 3,000 different products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the launch phase of its range of makeup products Boutique so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an increasingly demanding aspect for younger consumers.
The retail chain The Fragrance Shop will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first did it last week in Croydon, south of London, while the second will open it in Selly Oak, Birmingham, further this year.
Purchasing the Internet and changing a habit of buying food in smaller amounts every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, stores will be gathering in large stores in an attempt from the supermarket chain to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount supermarkets with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since he acquired both chains two years ago, which, commenting, has served to restart the sales of women and increase the profitability of purchases.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to restart its beauty and pharmacy products departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it quickly ended up not agreeing on how to divide the benefits of the pharmaceutical chain into the supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury's three years ago from its 281 pharmacies business at Celesio, the owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for £125 million.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands for skin, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, comments: “We have transformed the look of our beauty products passports to improve the face environment to our customers.
We have invested in specificly formed workers who will be great help in providing advice.
Our brand range is designed to adapt to any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of our favorite destinations for beauty products and challenge the traditional way to make purchases.”
Peter Jones “free” after Holly Willoughby turns back on a £11 million deal
The star of Dragons' Den Peter Jones marched "furious" after television shower Holly Willoughby made behind a £11 million deal with Jones's lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate itself to the business of Truly household products and accessories.
The business of these two media characters had been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Den Peter Jones angry to withdraw in the last minute of the profitable business set of lifestyle brands to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report great benefits.
According to several sources, Jones was "furious" when the red star on television admitted, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at its empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the new presentation agreements, worth 1.5 million pounds, implies that it would no longer have enough time to dedicate access to the common brand Truly products.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and sought to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was Holly's main priority from far away.
It was intended to be its long-term future and where we would see it for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to come back left all the parties involved without words.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch.
Now there’s a warehouse full of goods at its Marlow plant to be sold.”
According to experts, the release of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to the important investment it had made in products, from cows and mirrors to home clothing, and the possibility of delays for its release.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin had kept a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined her as president last March.
Both couples spend their holidays together, and Jones also owns 40% of shares in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity ITV show.
A source close to Jones commented year-end that "We will not make any comments on your business."
"And then we fell in love."
He made a joke on the possible criticism he received by the media to make a comment that some would consider “a little president” and to have a so positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, although making a joke about the voice of a reporter:
"I didn't give up anything."
She noted that Kim was interested in celebrating a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was declared a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations towards denuclearization are stacked.
More than three months after the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korean high diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "reply response" by the United States to the first disarmament initiatives made by its country.
Nevertheless, he observed, the US continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s view was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing it very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We are going to declare the war to North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now let’s keep this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have had positive results: the end of missile tests, helping to release hosts and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual focus talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this crowd full of people, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, noting the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations of other countries that were not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared a prerequisite to be able to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have left very clear that they do not require international assistance, so that the situation is strongly demanding," Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not sure that foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether it is permitted to contribute to the time of providing assistance to international agencies.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has been built for tsunami refugees, they are not frequent at other costs.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the case of tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge amount of islands of Indonesia is, in the best of all cases, a challenge.
Natural disasters are even more difficult for logistics.
A hospital ship that was caught in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is now heading towards Paul; however, it will take at least three days to arrive in the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s defeated infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money on roads and railroads.
However, Joko’s government is facing the year coming to reelection loaded with financial deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the majority of Muslims have adopted a more conservative faith in falling.
More than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of displaced people are the result of the battles that take place in the streets between Christian and Muslim bands with arches, arches and firearms, and other bloody weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes the fourth goal with a bit far from Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League in front of Chelsea with his goal marked at min. 89 Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passing from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 27 meters from the Chelsea gate when his team was losing 1 to 0.
He took the ball to the left before leaving an incredible dog headed to the second stage.
The shooting crossed the whole area with a great elevation while moving towards the right cross of the gate.
The ball finally began the downfall over a full-shot Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended at the back of the network.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create my maximum time,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn't think very well, I just devoted myself to feeding."
Chelsea won 1 to 0 in the rest after marking a 25-minute goal through its Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the Blue team's forehead returned from the role a passing to Mateo Kovacic before starting from nearly half the camp and pushing towards the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic made a quick combination from the middle of the field.
After all, he made a great passing in depth, leaving Hazard inside the area with the controlled ball.
Hazard overcame the defense to end in the second stage with a moment with the left bed where the port of Liverpool Alisson Becker was unable to arrive.
Liverpool will meet in Naples at the group phase of the Champions League next Wednesday at 15:00 at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for its part, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths by Indonesian tsunami is 832
The number of deaths as a result of the earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the army of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5-sized earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves up to 6 meters, according to the portal of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho on a press wheel.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was entirely covered by the hand of the destroyed buildings.

Cromwell's statue of the British parliament became the last monument affected by discussion about "rewriting history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction in the pureest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by their Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before Westminster Palace would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclassy of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor made during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth commemorating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than not now, as a parliamentary defender before external pressure, in his case apparently the monarchy.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is a topic of historical debate.
What is true is that the 17th-century conflict formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a base of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A pig murdered injured by a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources reported.
The man, identified only by his name Yuan, was found dead with a cut artery and all blood covered near a pork court in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs vaccines in a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
As it is known, he had traveled with his cowboy from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave a pork court.
In the courtyard there was a large pig with blood in the mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250kg garry had injured the farmer from death, according to the report.
"My coach had broken legs and full of blood," said the coach, called "Wu", according to Guiyang's news.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither the property of Yuan nor his property.
One of the market officials commented on the news of the evening that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to avoid attacking no one else, while the police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
According to the report, Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although very uncommon, cases of pigs that attack humans have previously been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious wounds.
For years before, a pig of nearly 300 kg captured a gallery farmer against his tractor until his wife could frighten the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are usually not aggressive but that blood taste can act as "decandidating".
"They like to play.
They're like children, they're so curious... they're not going to hurt.
“You just need to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of the Rosa Hurricane will bring turrets across the southwest of the U.S.
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakening as it progresses over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, the Rose will carry turrets across the north and southwest of the U.S. over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owned by a category 1 hurricane at 5:00 p.m. on Sunday morning, east of the United States, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is beginning to form a depression in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. When the Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity from the US south-east to north-east.
The Rose will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
After all, tropical humidity will interact with the depression that approaches to generating generalized torrencial plugs throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, waste flows and the possibility of land wash in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause some precipitation indexes close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
They are expected from 50 to 100 mm of rain in parts of the southwest, especially largely in Arizona.
There is the possibility that they form laughter, as the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the dispersed character of tropical plugs.
It is completely uncommon to enter the desert to walk in front of the tropical rain threat.
Torrencial plugs could cause the throat to turn into uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind rats and dust clouds in concrete points.
The nearby depression will bring turrets to certain points on the southern coast of California.
Total precipitation may be recorded by more than 50 mm, which could cause smaller waste flows and relics paths.
This was the first precipitation of the season of plugs in the region.
They will begin to arrive isolated tropical rainfall in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more generalized between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrencial plugs will escape towards the region of the Four corners on Tuesday and will persist throughout the entire Wednesday.
In October there will be several important temperature variations for all the United States as the Arctic is cooling, although the tropics will remain very warm.
This phenomenon may occasionally cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The U.S. central region on Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent heat of the summer will try to expand again.
It is expected to begin in October with heat largely in the central and east region of the U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Planes area to northeast parts.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above the average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures will be recorded over the middle east of the U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate to the Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which was supposed to take place in the 80s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impeachment continued, with the broadcasters interrupting the usual schedule of Friday due to a round of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to ensure that the FBI conducts an investigation of the tasks for a week.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee for Judicial Affairs that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to pull her clothes at a party of the institute.
Kavanaugh, in a high witness, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators have seen witnesses this Friday.
The company accounted for the average audiences of the chains of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The audience numbers were not immediately available for other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen is often having trouble calculating the people you see from his office.
In perspective, it is an audience similar to an American football playoff game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the chain with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS achieved 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the witness.
Flake was the main figure of Friday’s drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was engaged by demonstrators as he tried to go up to an elevator to a view of the Judiciary Committee.
Flake stayed for several minutes with a stunning view while she was broadcasting live on television at CNN.
"You're here, in front of you," said a woman.
“Do you think you’re telling the truth to the country?
They said, "You have power, but there are so many women who don't have it."
Flake said her office had issued a statement and, before the lift's doors were closed, she commented that she would have more to say in the sight of the committee.
After a few hours, all the cable and broadcast chains were already retransmitted directly at the time when the Judiciary Committee had to vote whether or not to follow the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate to submit it to vote.
Flake said, in return, that he would only do it by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the face-to-face appointment next week, a condition required by the minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced thanks to the conversations he held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake was influenced, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into alliances against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized their plans to leave the European Union to "play to make politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and to ignore national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the newspaper, May Boris Johnson's former foreign minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he claims that the proposal that the UK and the EU are mutually collecting taxes is "of all absurd".
Wayde Sims' murder: Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU's player
Police arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who milited the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20-year-old, has been arrested and sent to a second-degree prison accused of murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
The authorities made a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost their glasses during the bar.
The police recovered the glasses on the crime scene and claim that they have found Simpson's DNA in them, according to the CBS WAFB subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, he admitted Wayde had died of a kidnapping, according to the police.
Its funding has been fixed at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The forensic office of the East Baton Rouge district published a preliminary report on Friday, adding that the cause of death was a fire weapon injury to the head towards the neck.
The department thanks the operational group of refugees from the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for the assistance provided in the investigation that has culminated in this detention.
LSU Sport Director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the zone’s order forces for his “dilignment and seeking justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Average 1.98 m, he played and grew up at Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player at the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 reboots to start last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team was "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong time".
“Things like this are those that make you suffer at all times,” Wade said.
A volcano screw cedar in Mexico City
The cedar struck by the Popocatepetl volcano has arrived in the southern barriers of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday that they should stay away from the volcano after crater activity was detected and 183 gas and cedar emissions were recorded in a period of 24 hours.

Police face Catalan separatists just before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence faced with the anti-ambulatory police and thousands of people joined in counterparty protests to remember the first anniversary of the vote in Catalonia on their secession.
A group of independentist individuals arrested by the anti-wave police began to throw eggs and painting in dust, causing the emergence of dark clouds of dust in the streets usually invaded by tourists.
Later on the same day, the police took off their bows in order to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups sang "Don't forget, don't forgive" face to face with Unionist protesters who called "Length Life in Spain".
Fourteen people had to be killed by mild wounds suffered during the protests, local sources said.
The tensions have not decreased in this region of independent mentality a year after a referendum was held on 1 October, but was also conducted by the Catalan separatists.
Voters elected independence by a large majority, although the participation index was low, as opposers to the secession boicated the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the vote entering electoral colleges across the region, causing violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped all night Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The protest took place in the same way, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narcís Termes, a 68-year-old electricist and one of the participants in the independentist demonstration along with his wife, said he had no more guidelines on the possibilities that Catalonia could achieve independence.
Last year we lived one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying gladly for being able to vote, but now we’re excited,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although for short time, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have suffered to maintain the impetus this year, since many of their leading leaders are in a self-implanted exile or detained waiting to be judged for his later role in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the demonstration of support to the police with her phone, and claims that the conflict has been held by the politicians of both bands.
“Stress is only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial late last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting itself as a candidate to the European elections is the best way to denounce the recession in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after wearing a house with a car

The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said he had damaged the doors and the building.
It is also possible that somebody has shot a ballast against the car at some point.
Menga game gives Livingston victory for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
The Livingston, who had risen this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in which everything is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team gets to the second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, in return, continues without winning out of home at the Premiership this season. The next Sunday will face the leader, the Hearts, with which they separate a difference of eight points.
But before this, Rangers get the Rapid of Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
The Livingston, while extending up to six matches his invicted race in the league, with a Holt as a coach who still does not know what is the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of visitors’ direct game
The Holt team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, since its direct game caused all kinds of problems at Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way between the defense, but deceived his occasion when he was in front of the gateway. After that, Alan Lithgow sent the ball out to stretch out to try to finish Craig Halkett's head pass, who crossed the gateway.
The locals were already good to let the Rangers sleep in their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
And that’s how this decisive goal has been achieved.
The arbiter criticized a lack of the interests of Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could first touch it and end it from the central part of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he found himself with an impenetrable defense and a bearer Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The scenario was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
On the other hand, Rangers' bearer Allan McGregor stopped with his feet an occasion by Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up deviating another Livingston combination game.
The Rangers devoted himself to stealing once and another pilot in the area of Livingston, only to be rejected. In addition, two criminals were claimed, one for the alleged entry of Halkett to the substitute Glenn Middleton, and the other for the hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "fenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland to Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great results for Livingston.
A man believes that they have been excellent, and continue to overcome all expectations on this ascending path.
Their game style and staff have almost changed since their return to the maximum category, although much of the measure has to be assigned to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since their arrival.
There was a good hero collar.
Captain Halkett was huge, heading for a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be hanging from Menga throughout the match.
The Rangers missed inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, they definitely didn’t know to keep the level.
They didn’t know how to create occasions (as soon as they had clearly overcome local defense), and that’s what the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Receipt for Erdogan in Cologne
It was a clear smile and sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met together for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to repair the relations between NATO's two allies.
These have deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey’s inclusion in the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new gigantic mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police urged security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers were engaged around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, were also made as they condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled as dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies when jumping with a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the cruise of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic zone in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 local hours.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although the paramedical services served the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident occurred months after another cyclist died in an atropellate case at Childers Street, 1.6 km from the Saturday accident site.
The metropolitan police said its agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut and deviations for bus routes have been applied. In addition, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six agents injured in an altercate
Six prison agents have been injured in an altercation in this high-security prisoner centre, according to the center office.
The facts took place in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire, at 9:30 p.m. on Sunday, local time, and still lasting.
Specialized "return" agents moved to the site of the facts to put an end to the altercate, in which eight prisoners were involved. The avalot could be contained by one side.
The agents had to be killed by light injuries on the face instead of the facts.
According to a prison service spokesman: “We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to look at an incident in the Long Martin prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be wounded.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that the officers of this altercate will have to take accounts to the police and may have to spend even more time on the girl."
In the Long Lartin prison centre there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison had to be arrested in a hospital after being attacked by a recluse.
In addition, in October last year, anti-aval agents acted in prison to resolve a serious altercation in which the center personnel were attacked with billar balls.
The Rosa Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (the areas with the sea could be beneficial)
It is not usual that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but this is exactly what it is likely to happen at the beginning of the week that you see when what remains of the Rosa hurricane passes through the southwest desert, with the resulting risk of floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rain alerts for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Rose is expected to arrive directly to Phoenix on Tuesday and approach Monday night with plugs.
Phoenix's National Meteorological Service commented on a pillar that only "two tropical cycles have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression in a 322 km radius from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center provide 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where it would be recorded up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocalloses and the Gran Conca, could record from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points up to 100 mm.
For areas outside the risk of floods, the Rosa rain could become a very good news, since the region suffers from a strong dry land.
Although the rivers are a serious cause of concern, some of the precipitation could be very beneficial, as the southwest region currently suffers a drying.
According to the U.S. Dry Control Service, more than 40% of Arizona’s state suffers as at least extreme dry, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, the Rosa Hurricane will touch land on the Peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm finds cold waters in the Pacific, which makes me lose strength.
So, it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitations in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a significant risk of floods.
According to weather.com, "they expect 75 to 150 mm of total rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm".
After that, the Rosa will head toward the north crossing Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the border with Arizona at the first hour of Tuesday morning with tropical depression, to finally cross Arizona state and arrive to the south of Utah well on Tuesday night.
"The main risk we expect from the Rose or what remains from it is very strong precipitation in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest desert of the U.S.," the National Hurricane Center said.
Plugs are expected to cause dangerous rivers and waste flows in the deserts, lovers of land slaughter in mountainous areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh "have suffered the disgrace and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote of rejecting the displeased and indignate tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump decreed in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “have suffered the mosquito and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout its appointment process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress on Thursday, deniing Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of abusing her sexually decades ago, when both were teens.
Ford also stated at the sight in relation to his alleged.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality and courage.
"The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the brightest minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable pathway of service to citizenship," he said.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of the Republican voters' participation in the elections of half of the mandate.
“We are in five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but actually I was there,” he said.
That’s why I’ve been fighting for our big candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that Democrats are dedicated to “restraining and obstructing”.
The first key procession vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as early as Friday, according to an assistant from the Republican party's leaders.
Centuries of deaths by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been redheaded by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people met on Friday for a festival celebrated on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards the cave, rushing many people up to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-sized earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, the people were still carrying out their activities at the beach and did not run away immediately. That is why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come in the sun, it threw cars, trunks, houses, it destroyed everything that was on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who went upstairs from a tsunami tree and could survive.
About 16,700 people had to be evacuated at 24 different centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the number of devastated stores and buildings is appreciated, rotated and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to take off this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by the intense earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb released over Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the city's geographical characteristics, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami exponentially.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped between the arms of the broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 extraviated.
According to Nugroho, the dead and damage could increase the coast to about 300 km north of Palu, a region called Donggala, closest to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications “were completely paralyzed and therefore there was no kind of information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end a lot worse,” he said.
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday to not report the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although the agents said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared fan on social networks, you can feel like a man located on the upper floor of a building gives desperate warning to people from the street on the nearby tsunami.
In minutes, a wall of water sprouts along the coast of the sea, carrying buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to authenticate the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a generalized cutting of electrical supply that has interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid to cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, evacuations are still desperately in need of food, as well as other basic needs.
The airport has been reopened only for aid tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths by the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very difficult.
Despite the fact that workers from World Vision in Donggala were able to arrive safely in Palu, where employees were hired in lounge shelters installed at the courtyard of their office, during the route they had to see scenes of total destruction, Doseba said.
“They said they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a disaster.
Although the aid groups made the desolating gesture to start the aid tasks, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding collection, provisions and staff staff can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared."
While it burned the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and family of the missing people kept the hope that the miracle occurred and their loved ones praised the desolating story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, he rescued a child caught in a keyboard.
Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the hand for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parapent team, had trained two of the missing parapentists for the Asian Games, which concluded at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the area of the paraply, I have my own emotional burden,” he pointed out.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapent community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who participated in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a grey verification mark instead of a double blue mark.
“I think that means that the messages weren’t received,” he added.
Thieves earn $26,750 while filling an automatic box in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 to a Brink's employee who was filled with an automatic cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the vehicle driver was budding the automatic box to the entertainment complex and was preparing for more money to distribute.
While he was doing his job, another man “leaped down behind Brink’s staff” and stole him a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of implications in the incident.
Anyone who has information about his identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes the Name of Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed the name to Ye.
On Saturday, as he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: "Being formally known as Kanye West."
In West, 41 years old, he was named after Ye, and used these albums as the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before its appearance in Saturday Night Live, in which it is expected to present its new album, Yandhi.
The rapper replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation by “emotional motives,” according to the author of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious significance for him.
“I think that’s the most used word in the Bible, and the Bible means you,” West said at the beginning of this year, while talking about the title of his album with the Big Boy radio show.
“So I am you, I am you.
I have passed from Kanye, which means the only, simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is sooner a reflection than we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers that have changed its name.
Sean Combs has known him with various names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, an ancient West co-worker, has chosen his surname with or without scripts and in majors.
Mexican President AMLO promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s elected president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised to never use military force against civilians, when little is needed to fill the country’s 50th anniversary of a cruel repression against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "there will never be used again to repress the Mexican people."
On 2 October 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the death of 300 people at a time when the students' left-wing movements were around Latin America.
López Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the behavior and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted by criminal bands.
U.S. should double the funds for the IA
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money they spend on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in artificial intelligence that worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. Government have announced measures on IA, although there is a general lack of formal IA strategy in the country.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become world number 1 with regard to IA innovation in 2030.
“Duplicating the IA budget would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be pioneers of the next advances in the IA field,” Lee said.
“Duplicating funding could double the chances that the United States achieves the next big discovery in IA,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China’s most prominent IA companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an IA system that overcame the U.S. Othello player with the best ranking and later exercised as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively appreciated previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionary.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “China is not taking academic leaders; it is companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university excellence to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of IA could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I think they should automatically offer permanent residence cards to doctors in the IA,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its latest generation artificial intelligence development plan.
“The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funds to individuals of academic institutions in the same way as the U.S. Foundation for Natural Sciences and other public agencies give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China,” Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defense established a Centre for Artificial Intelligence, designed to participate in the industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selected Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As regards the Natural Science Foundation, it currently allocates over $100 million a year to research in IA.
In the meantime, it has not been applied for months in connection with the U.S. legislation that claims to establish a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians celebrate a referendum to decide whether to change the country’s name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that has existed with Greece for decades, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its North Road name constitutes a claim from its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign makes doubts whether it will reach at least 50% of the necessary participation in order to remain the referendum valid.
The question indicated in the role of the referendum is: “Are you in favour of NATO and the EU accession, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that is worth paying for achieving the accession of Macedonia, one of the countries that have created a breakdown of Yugoslavia, to organizations like the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the empire of the European Union, because it means that we all will have a safer life," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a number of parliamentarians have demonstrated that it will meet the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a majority of two-thirds is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there was no irregularity at 13:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared to 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," 62-year-old Gyose Tanevski said in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum held in Macedonia on the change of country name, which will open the way of joining the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed for people who would bow to the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join it with the high head, not with the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“I am a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can visit other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO integration will be accompanied by more investments than needed in Macedonia, which has an impact rate of more than 20%.
“I think the great majority will vote for it because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before his role.
Zaev said a "yes" would assume the "confirmation of our future".
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure by minimum participation required.
According to the results of another survey, directed by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of surveys are expected to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote "yes".
Since the referendum is valid, the participation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first tough for the pro-western government policy since it took the relief in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City, makes a goal after regain all Brighton defense
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling cancelled Brighton's defence in Manchester City victory by 2 to 0 in the match played at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, last Saturday.
Agüero scored a 65-minute goal in a game that looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine front received a pass in the middle of the camp at the beginning of the sequence.
He walked rapidly between three Brighton defenses, dragging with which he went out to the playground.
Then, Agüero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He ran a defense before surpassing a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass on his left that he found Sterling.
The front of the English returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Agüero, who with his right bed beat the Brighton porter, Mathew Ryan, with a dog who climbed to the inside of the network on the right side.
“Agüero has molesties at the foot,” Pep Guardiola, City coach, told journalists.
He decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky to have scored a goal at that moment.”
But he was Sterling who gave the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
His goal was at 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball in depth in the Brighton camp and
He made a beautiful passage in space for the left side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane led the ball before passing it to Sterling along the palm.
The Sky Blues front ended the ball in the network before leaving the back line.
The City faces Tuesday at Hoffenheim in a group phase of the Champions League at 18:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to remove the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were no guidelines to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, expects to go to the top of the launcher on Sunday that comes against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have opportunities to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a comfort with victory for 5 to 2 against the Nationals Friday night, but still seek their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least get out to launch the environment here, in Denver, and knowing that the other team is likely to fight each point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
Why would I want to lose this game?”
Nationals still have to announce an open launcher for Sunday, but they are apparently determined to let Scherzer leave if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, made a heating session on Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual rest day.
Washington's right launcher has a record of 18-7, with a ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikes on 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump is making a meal in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the half-mandate elections.
“Everything we have done is in play in November.
It will last five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I don't present myself, but I actually present myself. That's why I'm fighting for fantastic candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, is going through right now.
They are determined to recover power by all the necessary means, they see their shame, their bad intention.
It doesn’t matter to those who do wrong, to those who have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we don’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to “restain and obstruct.”
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he recalled, and titled the Democrats of "enthusiastic, like, crude, and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic Senator of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying it provoked a strong written public.
“Have you recurred your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, no, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party has to be a different party.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I wasn’t surprised.
In the end, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she expressed her determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the motions of censorship, I was criticized for discrepancy with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues concerning which Jeremy discrepancies with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was reported that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
During most of my eight years as a local labourist parliamentary, the meetings of the General Committee held on Friday night have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is not the whole of many meetings, and for a long time has been forgotten the promise of "more generous and friendly policies", if it is that it has ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergence opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable for the party’s direction.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he was sharing a similar political vision expected that I would do a 180-degree turn and take positions that he would never have taken, whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what you say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made so that my candidate will not be renewed, the central policy is announced and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t happen only to me.
In fact, I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues that every day must face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they won’t come.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that party so diverse, and with each motion of “unconfidence” or any change in the rules of selection, the party has been extended more.
In the last two years I have received many tips and have recommended that you keep your head down, that it wasn’t so expressive and “everything would go well.”
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time of study, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left my entire class literally enclosed, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, either as a local adviser or as a minister of the government.
I have never hid my politics, not even in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could doubt in any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
To those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But, in fact, the message I want to transmit was not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are working members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat to renew my candidate or any political interest will prevent you from acting, according to my opinion, in the interests of all your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: A Ayr imbatuts head the leadership
Two last hour trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayrs won victory in this vibrant match of the Tennent's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only team of the ten, occupy the first position in the classification table.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to its defensive superiority and the fact that he knew he had better benefited from the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have tested us and we’re still impatient, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, a member of Melrose, said: “Congratulations to Ayr, you have enjoyed the chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put in front of the Ayrs, but a grog card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, ceded for the Warriors party, allowed Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted trial.
Climo expanded the advantage of the Ayrs with a penalty and, just in half, noted and converted an attempt to put the marker 17-5 in favour of the Ayrs in the rest.
But the Melrose began well the second part, and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
After that, the game was interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury that was suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who was retired in literature, and the Ayrs resumed the distance again with a Stafford McDowall attempt converted by Climo.
Next, substitute captain Blair Macpherson was ammonised with a groove card, and again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of another man with a non-convertible test from Bruce Colvine at the end of some moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a groove card to make a ball-free placement in Climo, since the sanctions line, MacPherson noted a contraassay behind the Ayr penetrating moll.
Climo marked, as he had done again since the retreat, after Kyle Rowe picked up a dog from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line Gregor Henry to record the fifth hit of the local team.
Still Game series star seems to be ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be ready to go to the hosting sector, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and co-attagonizes with Greg Hemphill, his comic couple for a long time.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper pointed out that Kiernan was intending to enter the “flowing restoration sector” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastal, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The navals patrol their navy covered with exarch in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases from the Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are emphasized with the theme: “The sea is our right.
Regaining it is a duty.”
Around the coastless territory of Bolivia, the record of a lost coast in front of Chile in a cruel resource conflict in the nineteenth century remains very living, as is the angel of renaming the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, not to say, wait for the result with a positive attitude,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on large screens throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will say in favour of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is forced to negotiate the concession of a submarine sea exit for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a political battle for the reelection next year, also has many hopes deposited in the resolution of Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court would decide in favour of Bolivia and that, if they do so, things would not change too much.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, which occurs only six months after the final alliances, indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
And far from seeing favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a retrocedent in the last four years.
“The current Bolivia administration has secreted the issue of sea access,” Zárate said.
“The gorgeous retoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of good will by Chile,” he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep conversations after this episode.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in La Haia, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was extremely quick.
The next Monday, Bolivia will have “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end up 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
He spoke to the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is about to recapture nuclear diplomacy that has been launched more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Laughter says it is a chimera to think that the ongoing U.S. sanctions and opposition to a statement that ends the Korean War can make North Korea ever grow.
Washington refuses to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make important disarmament movements before.
Kim and President Donald Trump want to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a generalised skepticism on the fact that Pyongyang is seriously taking the issue of resigning from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo will visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion slides reveal the latest range of large-scale barrels, from a road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of bars or you want to completely protect yourself from the sun, do not have to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of extravagant barrels of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram has been drawn by very unpractical barriers, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the passage.
Valentino’s outstanding piece was an exaggerated beige bar, decorated with a wide wing, in the form of plum, which floods the head of the models.
Among other overdimensionate accessories, there were funny sinks, a brush barrel and even a pine, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strawberry masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, living colors, had cosy lips and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than not with high cushion.
One creation was assembled as a complete submarine team, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a ice cream.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you’re lucky.
Style observers predict that huge barriers could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The large-scale bars tremble the tails of the “Bomba”, a ball bar, with a wide wing of two feet, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the bar so unpracticed that it was scattered through social networks brought another great creation to the pastel: a ball bag for the beach, almost as large as the bathrobe model wearing it.
The raffle bag, dark ornament, decorated with raffle seals and finished with a white leather nanny, was the highlight piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people carrying large bars and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has had a great impact, it would be a regret that the demand for large-scale accessories is unknown.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent examinations results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for later and secondary studies, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages are still a very popular and desirable choice matter at school.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, you will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in your own language, you will come to your heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate confidence with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the annual exams, we can see that languages lead classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the A-graduation.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools reflected that 72% of students obtained A higher qualification in Mandari, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a selection assignment, are kept in the same regard as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 investigation by the UK Occupation and Competition Commission revealed that 17% was awarded to the lack of linguistic competences for the reasons entrepreneurs gave them to cover their vacations.
Thus, linguistic skills are increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more potential jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a chosen person, if he has learned a second language, will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children the best opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland there is diversity among schools in terms of languages that are taught.
Some schools focus more on the most traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, by 2020, such as Mandari or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you will always be able to choose from a series of languages at independent schools, which have a specialist teacher in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed, regardless of what the future is going on.
In the global commercial environment of the present era, it cannot be denied that languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, and that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to Scottish young people.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait has almost ended for fans who want to see LeBron James playing his first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still need to determine the minutes you're going to play.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said at the Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After this week's early training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six pre-season match calendar.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign acts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five programs for next week, including visits to friendly sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court’s vacation is waiting, Trump seeks to obtain support for the next half-mandate elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing Congress control when the votes are issued in November.
What time is Trump’s mindset in West Virginia this night and how can you see it online?
Trump's míting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 19 p.m.
Trump's tweeting in West Virginia can be seen online on the link specified below, through live video transmission by YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing initiated this week with the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of the sexual abuse charges he faces, while the Senate’s predicted confirmation vote remains in wait until a week and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of miting is to help Republicans present in the delicate November elections to charge impulse.
According to Reuters, President Trump’s five campaigns scheduled for the next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and sympathetics, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible, while we are heading towards a season of captive campaign,” Trump’s spokesman said he refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
Tonight's having, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather sympathizers "from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract Pittsburgh's media coverage", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a republican candidate to the Western Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the investigation.
“It’s not a good signal for Morrisey that the president has to come to boost him in the investigations,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows its ambition to keep face-to-face hopes in individual Sunday matches
After three unmatched sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bass pedal of dynamics is an invented sporting concept, in which players really cross, especially in such competitions.
So, on what side is the positive dynamics now?
“They had an advantage of six points and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive race,” Jordan Spieth said while leaving at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a bit in his favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state shaped by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tea to green and is giving an example.
The celebration cries rise intensely while continuing their turn and remained a crucial bit to hit the fourth party, when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
He celebrated the puppet that made them win the match in the 15th hole with a similar criture, as he suggests he believes that the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to make your best effort and worry about your own party,” Spieth pointed out.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 holes to leave printed.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable sense of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple bears four of four and does not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last new holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way your energy seems to flow to and from the public bullshit, it is reaffirmed that they are battery players on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, speaking of European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs, who made a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first new holes threw the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole from which they never had an option to go out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of the hole.
Furballs and fursomes are very fascinating to see for interactions between devices, tips they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
Until now, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motive to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the end of the Ryder Cup with a favourable marker of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after completing Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10 to 6 victory over the United States.
The two inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, up to now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team uncertainly at the morning fourballs and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance to foursomes and won two matches, but couldn't reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team had to achieve eight points in the 12 individual matches on Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to achieve four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known as the surname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second couple who wins four points in his first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After enslaving Woods and Patrick Reed to the fourballs, they made a brilliant performance to beat a Woods deflation and American debutman Bryson Dechambeau for a 5&4 even more empathy.
Woods, who had been thrown into two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic genius pursuits, but lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consequence.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the fourballs in the morning, joined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as the first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all face on a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas established a reference point on Saturday for Americans to achieve two points.
They earned a decisive victory by 2 to 1 against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 to 3 in the foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team had restarted a four-point difference in the individual matches, although Furyk’s team, the title defender, just needs to empathize to preserve it.
Nevertheless, after being the second best for two days, it appears that a contra-attack on Sunday is out of its scope.
North Korea declares that it will not be unilaterally disarmad “in any way” if not appreciated signs of trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continuous sanctions were intensifying their inconfidence in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken “important good will measures” during the previous year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demontering the nuclear test center and committing them not to proliferate weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see any response in consonance with the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not start unilateral disarmament in any way.”
Although Ri resumed North Korea’s known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “per phase” denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as long as measures were taken paulatinately, its statements seemed significant because it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done.
Ri made a reference to the joint statement that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made at the first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim committed to working on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang had to eliminate its nuclear weapons before.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the hard international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercitive manner, in addition to opposition to the ‘war end declaration’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will bring us closer to us is a milestone of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are increasing our inconfidence.”
Ri did not refer to plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this situation.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what he held last year, when he declared at the UN General Assembly that pointing to the U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Evil Trump titled Kim of Rocket Man in a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but expressed that there is still much to do and sanctions must be kept until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time for this, and it doesn’t matter if it was two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council that “the application of sanctions of the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm complete and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has driven sanctions to North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bet to cut financing of Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but in the end of a few hours North Korea accused him of making “self demands of a gangster.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to unmounting a missile centre and a nuclear complex if the United States would take "measures in consonance".
Kim told him that the “consonant measures” he was looking for were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions towards normalization of Washington’s relations.
Harvard students do a course on rest habits
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in an attempt to fight culture, increasingly broad, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
A scholar observed that students of the university number or the world are often ignored about the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Son Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after making a discussion on the impact that sound privation had in learning.
At the end of the conversation, a girl approached me and asked, “Why are they saying this now, all of this, in my last year?”
He said no one had ever told him about the significance of the sound, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students explain the basic concepts on how good sleep habits improve academic and sport performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services at the University, claimed that the University decided to introduce the course after hearing that some students suffered a severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, for an hour, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboo and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects the sport performance in the lack of sleep, and the importance of keeping a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep privation can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain vessels, depression and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as a person has the right to know the effects he has for health to smoke cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride to keep awake all night still exists, he said, and added that the modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep privation a problem increasing.
Ensure to enjoy a good quality sound for long enough should be a “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, as the sound privation puts the brain in a mode of denial and makes students always win.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask postgraduate students to carry out a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to take into account a warning when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitting electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the circadian rhythm and cause problems of sound.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home, which suggests another defeat outside.
The Ibrox team sought to sum its first home victory from February 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat to Gerrard as a coach in 18 matches to leave his team at the derived, at 8 points of the Hearts, unprecedented leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga noted the goal seven minutes before half, and it never seemed like the Rangers, missing inspiration, was about to match the marker.
While the Rangers now falls to sixth place, the Livingston takes the third place, behind the Hibernians for a difference in goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as the line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object apparently thrown out of the gradient.
Gerrard made eight changes in respect of the alignment that he broke the Ayrs in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven title who launched a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he felt satisfied with the way his team, well organized, suffocated his rivals at all times.
Although the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored the two minutes of the game, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder deviated and unprofited the great opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' contundent missing release hits with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow did only a deviated right in the back.
The Rangers did with control, but they seemed to have more hope than they believed in their game in the third end.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty in the 15-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless caught, but arbiter Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two juts to carry the first part, but the first Ibrox carrier, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head coup and the doll in front of Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserve it only for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to play with Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted in the pause by changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a passage to Morelos, although the impressive Kelly fled to the blockade.
However, the Livingston continued to capture the attention of visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long, one retreat.
Holt's band could have given the direction to the final stages, but McGregor remained firmly rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deviation from the core.
The Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again made the big eyes.
Almanac: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that finally gave place to the device we know as "Geiger computer".
Geiger, a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, such as the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", played by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed physicists:
Home: “What is this?”
Rogers: “He is a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you have these headphones, you can listen to the effects of atoms emitting radioactivity to minerals.”
Evans: "I'm sure he's running out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malicious cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate malicious cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them to the laboratory
You can “see” a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells, saw that ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, alter them to the laboratory to be able to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently to re-injection them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.: "The results that we got suggest we have a promising vaccine."
Protein HER2 "favors the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorant, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focus consists of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West crashed into a pro-Trump diatry with a drop of MAGA after his performance in the SNL program.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written in the study during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulates President Donald Trump, and said he would be presenting in the 2020 elections.
After her third night song, Ghost Town, in which she was carrying a goat of Make America Great Again, began to criticize the Democrats and repeat their support for Trump.
“Always I talk to white people say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States for a long time,” he said.
The SNL program began with a parodie by Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the complaints of sexual aggression imprisoned by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't released, comedian Chris Rock raised the recording of West's disapproval on social media.
It was unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West with the publication.
Nevertheless, West has complained to the public that it was not well treated between guards due to the gourmet that he was pushing.
“I was threatened by the rabbits.
I was told you wouldn't go out with that puppy.
I've got assets.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the lower position?" as he said that Superman's layer would be placed because they couldn't tell him what to do. "Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments provoked the public's writings at least twice and the team members of the program seemed ashamed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication: "The brain study was completely mute."
West was substituted for the last hour of Ariana Grande, whose former rapper Mac Miller had died for a few days.
West left a great part of the audience with the interpretation of the song I Love it, discharged by Perrier's bottle.
West received the coupling of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most brave spirits: Thanks for departing from the Multitudy."
But the speaker of the debate program, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "wearing who it is and that it is absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward anyone (including their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) that I think it adopts and dismiss an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
“We too,” he added.
Before the program, the rapper announced on Twitter that it had changed its name and now was "being known before as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and the disappearance legend of the music Prince changed the name by a symbol and, later, the formerly known artist as Prince.

The Star of Thrones Game, Kit Harington, denounced toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for representing the role of the sword Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Thrones game.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of male hero, claiming that these papers give understanding that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and that he was questioned how to cope with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently been married to the Trons Game co-proprietary, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he is strongly determined to deal with this problem.
“Personally, I’m wondering where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
"What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are now experiencing?"
According to Kit, television can be part of responsibility for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its so male characters.
He added, “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and streets that make young boys feel that they have to have this facet of virility?
I think it’s one of the biggest questions of our time: how do we change it?
There is no doubt that something has done wrong with the young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not do any prequest or sequence of the Game of Thrones when the end of the series is predicted for the next summer, saying he is made of battles and horses.
From November, Kit will play a repository of Sam Shepard's True West work, which explains the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that knowing his partner Rose is the best he has provided him Trones game.
“I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte’s role, the love of the character representing Kit, Jon Snow, in the winning fantasy series of an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces an increase in cases by 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to healthcare professionals.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were declared.
The vast majority of new cases are sexual transmission, unlike the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spreading in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who suffer from HIV for this cause has decreased almost to zero, according to statements by Chinese healthcare professionals at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sexual means is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was deployed in China in 1997, but discrimination on LGBT collective is common.
Based on the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who hold homosexual relations end up getting married to a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of appropriate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has filtered data from senators of the Republican Party and disassembled "Dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday the charges that a member of his staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the lawyer’s Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic Party of Los Angeles claims that demands were driven by criticism and extreme-right websites.
“Lies, lies, and more misleading,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Assuming, the information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and published it by someone unknown in the Capitol during a Senate Commission session on sexual abuse complaints against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications was related to the Waters office and reveals the information of a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This groundless complaint is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, personal data and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent complaints, was not responsible in any way for such information filtering.
This unfunded complaint is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters’ statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of the White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
“It doesn’t have time to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
You don’t have to question the accused’s reasons.
You have to keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh’s Democrats, to whom critics accused of appearing too angry during the Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was presenting to defeat Waters in the mid-elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the criminals are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all the actions they have taken and that they will harm all and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spion Parodia
It is traditionally looking for references to the Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this repository of the frankness of Johnny English's action-comédia, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is not an exception.
Will this humorous self-sacrifice on how we are misunderstood be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent outlet eye and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew its license for the second time to cut it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English language territories with tradition to go to cinema.
Obviously, it is the stunning secret agent that, despite its rare claims of liquor glamour, has a little Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this couple that brings a single note to the theme of Fire Carros at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson that represented Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, where the chaos was sowing around.
There’s one or two good moments on this last trip.
I liked Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed with a medieval armchair and the sheets of the helicopter picked him up in the helmet.
There is what Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems quite flowing and strangely overflowing, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as an ingredient.
Humor seems to be dedicated to children more than adults and, for me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as brilliant or focused as Mr. Bean’s mute gays representing Atkinson.
The recurring local assumption is that Britain is in serious problems.
A pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and has revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the consternation of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resource for a prime minister who is a presumptuous and assaulted figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her the best of herself with this calted character of Teresa-May, but the script does not reach any more.
Their intelligence advisers inform him that, as far as every active spy is concerned, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the cursed Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but imparted extraofficial classes about how to become an agent covered, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spying academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his follower Bough, a role re-representing Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is slightly unprofitable.
Thus, Batman and Robin when things are put a lot of tickets to the secret service of His Majesty enter into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the enchantment of the trillioner technological charismatic who claims it can solve the computer problems of Britain: the silent Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odise of ridiculous bowls: chambers dishes, burn a French restaurant for fast dining, looks like the chaos against Volta’s luxury yoke and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality casco to get acquainted with the inside of the Flight House.
All the parades have certainly been extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, all pledged looks like a child program.
Things are pretty normal.
As with Johnny English’s other films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that justifies his talent.
The Labour Party refuses to think about a plan for British to have a four-day working week and cover five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and pay five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) to the workers giving them a more day of celebration.
The employees enjoyed a three-day weekend, but they received the same sound.
According to sources, the idea would match the economic agenda of the party and the plans to inclinate the country for workers.
The change to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress’s trade confederation as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not be from night to day, but a four-day working week is an aspiration that fits in the perspective of the party to balance the economy in favour of the workers and the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the last week’s party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister’s shadow plan also implies that water companies’ shareholders could not recover all the investment, as the labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes he perceived.
It has also confirmed plans for the placement of employees in joint ventures and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to get up to 500 GBP annually.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the findings of the agency could influence a Republican Senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published on Sunday, the "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
"In the session I said I had talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when everything happened, and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was strong, determined and secure.”
But Graham's vote seems to be fired.
“I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would present an explosive charge,” he said.
"Mrs. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it round," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“No one of the people I call will be able to check it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see you change anything again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do nothing to reduce poverty?
New York will welcome this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents an absolutely impressive star program, carrying out an impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy events such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken the world’s poor consciousness before the end end of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help to fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (even if someone wants to pay a VIP entry), assistants had to do a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteers, send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other activity to wake up awareness about the goal.
What success has Global Citizen now achieved for 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to convince them to demand a call to action or simply another case of what we call “clicktivism” (a person who thinks marks the difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its sympathetics, which have helped achieve various goals.
He said that these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce comparable commitments and policies to over $37 billion, which would have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 billion people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and advertisements derived from its shares, of which at least $10,000 million have been deducted or recovered.
The group estimates that protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, an association of investors and executives with its UK, which is committed to “aid children to grow as much as possible” and promises to send $35 million to Rwanda to help fight malnutrition to the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn social injustice of malnutrition into a foot of history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions demanding the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the R+Fs on your website that asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes we will steal and fail.
But as the great civil rights defense movements and against the previous apartheid, we will win, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at the event in New York, which will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "blocking" to obstruct Russian energy exports (Internal Secretary)
Washington may "if necessary" go to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hit the markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has reported that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates with the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they already do in East Europe, the southern bank of Europe,” he said.
According to the officials, there are ways and ways to deal with this issue.
“The United States, along with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to prevent their energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed assistants to the event celebrated by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group self-defined as the "voice of energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuel,” he said, indicating that Russia has only a resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuel.
The statements arrive while the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project “inadequate,” according to Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow’s “captious”.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11,000 billion and will double the existing gas pipeline capacity at 110,000 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unclear competition.
I think we share the opinion that Energy cannot be a tool to press and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has caused a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of Industries (FDI) has called on the U.S. to separate the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of BDI (Federation of German Industries) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "detain" her candidate for the presidency in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "detain" her presidential candidate after mid-election.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidate.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and get rid of the government’s fracture, that women occupy high duties,” The Hill said.
“After November 6, I’ll take my nomination to president seriously.”
Warren intervened on President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and claimed that he was "bearing the country in the wrong direction."
“I’m honestly worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been honest in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said in a tweet on Friday: “Obviously, an FBI investigation is needed before the elections.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters believed that it should not be presented by 2020.
A fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters have said that the Senate should not be presented, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
30 percent donors support the nomination.
The investigation revealed a broader support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38% in favour of a possible candidate and 48% in favour.
Other high profile names among Democrats that were taken into account in connection with a possible 2020 candidate include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator by Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes TEPT Track Palin in having Donald Trump
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up on September 11, 2007
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
“With what my own son is going on since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from TEPT ramifications and some of the emotional injuries with which our soldiers return,” he told the public in a Donald Trump miting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the next of his son and other war veterans: "they return a little different, they become hardened, they return wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charges were charged with domestic violence to a woman, with a statement of domestic violence and weapon ticking under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Divuit states and the District of Colombia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing bands or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to pick up an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case that the U.S. Union for Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and the children of the violent band" attacked her, but the U.S. officials denied their asylum application on July 20.
They arrested her in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the United States, as countries facing generalized band problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision from the Immigration Appeals Board, allowing undocumented immigrants to escape domestic violence to request asylum.
Columbus District Prosecutor General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal laws require that asylum applications be adjudicated according to the facts and particular circumstances of the demand, and that ban violates this principle, according to the friend of curiae.
Lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrant entry harms the U.S. economy, as it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and bands.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or for racial reasons, religion, nationality or pertinence to a concrete social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement on 11 June of this policy.
Asylum has ever preferred to alleviate all of the problems, not even the worst, in which people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiplie in a sprint to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very good," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while calming her son with fever in a devastated evacuation center in Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies.
There is no drinking water."
Residents have been seen to return to their destroyed homes to take flooded relevances and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injuries, and hospitals, injured by the 7.5-sized earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his shoulder, are outside of Palu’s military hospital, as the patients are treated outside due to the strong kidneys that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake pulled out the room of the hotel's fifth floor where he was with his wife and his daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I was caught in the wall ruins, I think," Haris explained to Associated Press, and added that his family had attended a wedding to the village.
“I heard my wife ask for help crying and then I didn’t feel her anymore.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they’ll be fine.”
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of seizing with "propaganda ads".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in an American newspaper promoting the mutual advantages of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed China’s Daily payment supplement to the Iowa state’s most selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, an accusation that China denied.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US elections marked what U.S. officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of the Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that intensifies and has seen targeting tariffs on mutual imports.
China's Venetian arancels at the beginning of the trade war were intended to punish exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa governor for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and U.S. companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It's doubled the assault by publishing propaganda ads to our free press."
"In disclosing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment ad to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In exchange, to the quiosk that is down here in Beijing, you will find few discrepancy voices and you will not see a real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the economic trajectory concerned about China, as the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers was excluding the offer to publish” his article, but he did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans leave women's voters before half-parliamentary elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which faces various requests for sexual aggression, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the next mid-semi-legislative elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be dismissed," Grant Reeher, a professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s last hour pressure to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm up angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesperson of the MoveOn Progressive Group on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, the Protestants called "november is coming!" (November is coming) while they were in the Senate vesty while the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will remain out of the graphics," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said.
"The people say they've already been high; it's true.
But it could have been more, especially among the women of suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public witness, where he detailed his requests for sexual aggression to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative response could be made if Republicans pressured with confirmation.
"This has become an embolic for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the board or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is sitting in the bank of the accused. It also has to do with how Republicans have managed this issue and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose Democrats, notícies on the channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford star and the Kavanaugh witnesses, with the balance that slightly decays towards the last.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the surveys believe in Ford's testimony in a doubt or likely way, while 35% claim in a doubt or likely way, Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably lying or doubtless during his witness, while 30 percent claimed the same as Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's demands and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked it under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate taught him genitals at a party while they studied in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee is launching a new company that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Open Code Platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which individuals can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that Inrupt's hidden intention was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the emerging company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the Solid platform technology to enable users to create their own "personal data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, pending task lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spoify. They are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is exclusive from the online store of personal data is that the user decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company has adequate resources, processes and capabilities to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers contracted to work on the project and a voluntary encoder community.
From this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said no one of his teams is talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely built during the night.
“We are not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday publication at Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web integrated to the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergy of the Church of England who won a Winning Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honoured in his native city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and reverent Bernard Vann was guarded on September 29, 1918 by the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was abused by a firefighter four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
His two grandchildren deployed a memorial stone on a Saturday defiled in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "magically symbolic" that the lapid was presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prosecution.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battle against the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick beverage and under the intense fire of canons and meters".
Later he ran to the fire line and, with the "maximum courage" made the line forward before launching on a canon with a single hand and leaving athletes three members of the departure.
The Lieutenant Colonel was assaulted by a German killer on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war fell.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's actions were a prose that could never equate, causing you a feeling of humbleness.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the defeat, directed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to be part of the show and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by support that he will receive from many people.
The MMA fans who stayed sleepless all night to see Bellator 206, saw Peppa Pig instead of his
Imagine that you were awake all night to see Bellator 206 and that you have to see the most important event.
The San José cartridge contained 13 battles, including six of the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK at Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, the UK spectators were attonised when the programming changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disturbed because they were awake until the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change in animated drawings as "a type of vomiting acute".
“The government’s regulation says that this content is not appropriate at 6:00 p.m., so they changed the child programming,” Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications Dave Schwartz said when they asked him about the retransmission.
"Peppa's pants, yes."
The company's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on the programming to include UK spectators in the future.
“I think when I think of the repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But there are six of a Sunday morning and we can't solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at its time.
But we're working there.
Believe me, when I changed the channel, there were many messages that went and came, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We left it in five fights, instead of six as usual. We tried to show it again by the followers, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown feeling lower than the rest of the people because of their sexuality, but that gave him the motive to triumph.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that not everyone was like him.
In the Desert Island Discs Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to win the Olympics.
The usual long-term program presentator, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months of low disease.
Daley, who appeared as a naufrag in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less than" the others because "it wasn't socially acceptable like boys and girls."
He said, “Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and power to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that it was "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed when you end up discovering their sexuality.
The two-time winner of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high-profile LGBT movement promoter and has used his image of the Commonwealth Enguany Games in Australia to ask more countries to discriminate homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The world championship explained that he had been in love with a man, the American executive Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, "has caught him by surprise."
Last year, Daley married the winner of an Oscar, 20 older than he, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass so young (they participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced high and low similarities.
The couple were parents in June of a child who named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all her perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be there to occupy the first line," he said.
"When I took his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that was dead, that I finally accepted that it wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at some Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the choice of his first song (Heather Small Proud), which he had listened during the preparation for the Olympics and still putting him in the skin of chicken.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson was introduced to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a Sunday record playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unfortunate tape.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biannual event to beat a record for the 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being in the center of action, as usual for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments shares his time between making an animator and working in his game in the field, with the hope of correcting what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for Le Golf National’s hard drive, where the long rough is used to punish deviated cops.
And if his own trail isn't decorant enough, Mickelson, in the ninth Sunday match, will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches of this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson's game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say anything else.
"He perfectly understood his role for that day, made me a palmstone on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me that I would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“I have a lot of confidence in myself.
It is a well-known hall and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how I think we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like anybody else."
Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record of the maximum number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
It can mean the end of a race at the Ryder Cup that has not equated your individual registration.
Mickelson has won 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 empathy, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
"He's fun, sarcastic, funny, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great companion for the team," he explained.
“I think the younger players were also enjoying staying with him this week, which has been fun to see.
It brings much more alongside your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can be deleted soon.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows by experience that starting with a considerable advantage of the individual duels of Ryder Cup’s last day can easily become a hard day.
Denmark debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, when the Seve Ballesteros captain team had a five-point advantage over the U.S. team, but at the end they achieved the win at least 14,5-13.5.
"And you continue to remember that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for short," Bjorn said in the picture, after seeing the team's victory in 2018 for 5-3 both Fridays and yesterday, leaving the National golf at Le-6 in 10 marker.
The story has taught me and all the team members who haven’t finished yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the whole machine.
You have to go out and do everything well.
This does not end until the points get to the marker.
We have a goal, try to win the troop, and we have to keep the concentration to do so.
I’ve already said this, I’m focusing on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have those who are our rivals: the best players in the world.”
Enjoyed the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rash with that.
Tomorrow it will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It’s fantastic to be with a friend when everything’s fine, but individual duels try the best of your ability to play golf.
This is the message you have to send to the players, take the best of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, leave your friend and he must go out and take the best of himself too.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to make better individually than in team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points of four.
Furyk knows the two cores of the currency on the remnants of the last day, as he became part of the winning team in Brookline before ending losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good foot, as he saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, there is a lot of pressure on these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of attempting to start the remuneration against Rory McIlroy at the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says about his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, rebuilt
The new German Army fragrance should have been completed in 2014 to replace the ancient warships of the Cold War, but it will not, at least, do so until the next year that defect systems and cost increases, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg class fragrance, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military carrier.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the subsequent construction problems have marked the deadlines of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels that the Armada ordered in 2007 will replace the ancient fragrances of the Bremen class.
It is believed to include a powerful canoe, a set of anti-air and antibodies missiles, as well as technology against stealing actions, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other prominent features include longer periods of maintenance: new fragrances should be used for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that advance ships, which were expected to project Germany as a powerful force overseas, will be already obsolete when they enter operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fragrance F125 was news last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Little details are known for the reasons why it has returned, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inservible if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as approximately 120 seafarers, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen class flakes, operate on Baden-Württemberg class ships.
In addition, it was also known that the vessel’s weight is excessive, as it reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Army to add future improvements.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, 7,000 tons, is believed to weigh twice as much as class vessels used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the deficient materials, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to assume a problem.
It is believed to have reached some surprising $3.100 billion ($3.600 billion) from an initial budget of $2,200 billion.
The problems of the new fragrance have become a matter of particular importance, taking into account recent warnings that indicate that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the Army “is left without vessels that can be used.”
The officer said the situation has worsened over time because they stopped using the old vessels, but none of them were provided again as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the fragrances of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Armada.
The National Foundation Spy the Secret Life of the Rattens
A new research carried out in a finca of the highlands of Scotland aims to find out how ratpents use the landscape to feed themselves.
The discoveries are expected to provide new data on the behaviour of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scholars from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common ratpents, as well as northern ears and water ratpents in the botanical garden of Inverewe, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed in the property’s key locations to track the activities of the ratpents during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of ratpents and what each species does.
With this information, you will create a report and a map of habitat to create a detailed image on the scale of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser of the Scottish National Foundation, expects results to show which areas of habitat are most important for rats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of living management works, such as the creation of dishes, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for rats and other associated species.
The population of ratpents in Scotland and the rest of the UK has decreased considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration of buildings threaten the ratpents, as they affect the nodes and can cause habitat loss.
Wind and lighting turbines also pose a risk, as well as the matamosc paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, ratpents are not blind.
However, due to their night hunting habits, ears are more useful than eyes when they have to catch a trap.
It uses a sophisticated eco location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously.
It has ten experts with proper training, performing surveys, nose inspections and, sometimes, rescues regularly.
Even so, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to ratpents at the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of ratpent in Scotland.
The farm manager, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
"Here, at Threave, we have a great area for ratpents," he says.
“We have ancient buildings, many old trees and even a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of the ratpents, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
Note the importance of verifying whether you have been rated before doing maintenance tasks in property, as it may be possible that the possible destruction of a single maternity level of more than 400 women and young people, which could result in the disappearance of a whole local population.
The ratpents are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them, and destroy their nodes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Officer of the Scottish Ratten Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said, “We still have to learn a lot of ratpents and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data about their population.”
Ronaldo refuses prosecutions while his lawyer prepares a claim against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stated that allegations of rape against him are "false news" and has stated that people "will become famous" thanks to their name.
His lawyers will appeal to the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the charges.
The front of Portugal and the Juventus has been accused of violating an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Assuming, he paid at his time $375,000 because the incident was not made public, according to the information published on Friday by Der Spiegel.
In a video of Instagram Live addressing his 142 million followers hours after the charges were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, false news," said the five-time winner of the Golden Pilot to the camera.
"I want to be famous thanks to my name.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name to become famous, but it is part of my work.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s in order,” said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers have already prepared the claim against Der Spiegel for allegations, which have qualified as “unacceptable information of suspicions on privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages for a amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most striking infringements of personal rights in recent years.”
The suspected incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After having met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they were allegedly violated, according to archived reports at the Clark County District Judge, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo grew up after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99% good guy", except a "1%".
The documents argue that Ronaldo confirmed that both had sexual relations, but were agreed.
Majorga also claims that he went to the police and took pictures of the injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courts because he had "for repressives" and worried him "to be humbled publicly".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the agreement, as she is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to file for the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has been filed for the Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom is "always punishable" to lose car manufacturers
The United Kingdom is “always punishable” if you lose the world’s leading state in manufacturing after Brexit, Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added it was "disturbed" that the base of Toyota in the UK claimed to the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays on the borders in the event of a Brexit without an agreement could lead to losses of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My point of view is that if the UK leaves the EU without agreement at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Out of the EU without any agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has awakened the pores of other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just-time" basis, with pieces that arrive every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and the European Union for automaking.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching any agreement on March 29, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector considers could generate delays and fish shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to preserve inventory for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a consequence.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "accurately calibred to avoid these border controls."
"We have to reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that, as I say, let us not only enjoy the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers indicate that we need to continue with a set of production chains exit.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long the production would stop, but in the long term, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of the United the Union at the plant, said that members begin to be very concerned about the situation: “For experience, when they lose these jobs, they never return.”
“We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be rediscovered
Donald Trump’s expected meeting with Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein could “launch a week” while continuing the fight against the nominated at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the elections, links between Russia and help Trump and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is accused or not of the Deputy Prosecutor General and put Mueller’s independence at risk, he has powered the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors he was about to resign.
However, it was announced for Thursday a meeting with Trump, which was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would prefer not to accompany Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a meeting with the Senate court committee witnessing Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of bad sexual behaviour, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation to the FBI on accusations against Kavanaugh, making the Senate more vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared at Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "No date has been fixed yet, it could be this week, although it may be more a week for all matters with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see it. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists could reject this statement: Sanders has not made any information session in the White House since September 10.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the fanfaronerie of television journalists, although he said, “I will not deny that they are fanfaroners.”
He added that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders said the news sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask directly to the US president, it is much infinitely better than to talk to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and replace the information sessions when you can talk to the US President.”
Trump answers questions when he comes out of the White House or participates in open press sessions or wheels with official visits.
Individual press wheels are uncommon.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal appearance and, in some moments, strange in front of the journalists gathered.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service from fears for Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wish to continue there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK’s departure.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have continued, and yet it seems to be headed towards the decisions expected this late.
But the UK government has also started preparations in case of a possible scenario without agreement.
I know it’s time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat now that I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare task, while benefiting patients and communities we treat.
“Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie has been injured after an emergency operation
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers relief, has suffered an emergency operation after having suffered a head injury in the defeat on Saturday for 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ, Tennessee.
Tennessee State coach, Rod Reed, told the press that the injury occurred just before half.
"He came to the band line and broke out there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the side before placing it in a library and drag it to make it more evidence.
A Tennessee State officer reported Chris Harris, from WSMV from Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the surgeon at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type or scope of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie, second year, with Tennessee State after entering Illinois.
It had completed five posts on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on buying a property in the UK with additional money used to help people without homes according to the new Conservative Party plans.
This action will neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters.
The increase in the tax will be recorded on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million frees annually to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to charge a higher tax in buying a property in the UK and these money will be used to help homeless people, a measure that Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s movement’s success to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher yields.
The increase in the tax will be recorded on those people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK; these money will be aimed at the government’s action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The overload, which will be added to the current timber tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second residences and real estate speculations, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million frees annually.
It is estimated that 13% of London's new construction properties are from non-British residents, making it difficult to increase prices and make new buyers unable to open the property scale.
Many well-being areas of the country, particularly the capital, have become "fantasy cities" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in timber tax to help young people have their first home.
He accused large buildings of maintaining high property prices by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel quotas on affordable homes to correct the UK's "immobile disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as checks on rental and completion of "free guilt" cancellations.
He also wants to give more power to the meetings to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must be improved for every new generation.
This means to correct our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can not be correct that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for businesses with their home abroad, buying housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For many people, the dream of having a home in possession is too far away and the indignity of people without home makes it even more real.”
Jack Ross: “My maximum ambition is to train Scotland”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland has accepted the challenge of revising the Northeast club, which currently occupies the third position in the League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was once called to support and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound program.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland playing Hampden with my father when I was young and it’s always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I have successfully trained in clubs, but.”
Ross's predecessors in the Sunderland coach office include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic coach claims not to be the pressure to be the next on a list of names dedicated to such a big team, after rejecting previously Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
“For the moment, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is obvious that its place is the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d just think I’ve been successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technician body.
It helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for the rescue to champions of the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than during his stage as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the duty at Alloa.
“I always thought that training was what was best given to me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I went out reasonably and enjoyed enough good moments.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you need to overcome every week.
I still go through aspects like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I’m an adult.”

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat plant has fired consumption in the bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to the restaurants chains.
Bars and bar chains have gained a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has decreased by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from the CGA financial advisory, says: "The continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World, which has expanded more than expected, have made a most similar pattern in the case of July, except in June, with the rise of the bar 2, 8%.
The decrease of 1.8% in the consumption of restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer meals have also suffered with the sun, although it wasn’t as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, drink sales have increased by 6.6% over the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an occitan and hotel analyst of RSM, said: “These results continue to be the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and impact of large social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the external equity market.
It is no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales by 4.8% inter-annual would be particularly harmful, more than the continued cost pressure.
This long and warm summer could not have arrived at a worse time for food shops and the weather will tell if the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide this breath so necessary.”
The total increase in the sales of bars and restaurants, including opens recently, has been 2.7% in July, indicating the encouragement in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyses performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of over 9 million pounds and is the set-up reference point in the sector.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents
One in five children, some 11-year-olds, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated an increase in "Insta false" pages
News has made the fears about sexual content publication grow
20 percent of students say they have a “main” account that shows parents.
One in five children, some of 11-year-olds, create social media accounts that hide for adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students has indicated a rapid increase in Instagram fake accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site to share photos.
The news has made the fears about the publication of sexual content.
Around 20% of students say they have a “main” net account showing parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager calling others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of teenagers between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, half of whom have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s worried that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the athletes' vision" of the Scottish Federation of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish athletics federation at the annual general meeting of the organization.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with most Scotland medals and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from their internationally dillated experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has respect for the community of Scottish athletics, the UK and around the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I have a lot of gans to act as a voice of athletes and I hope to be able to make the sport grow and contribute to Scotland.”
The U.S., who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic bears and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was prevented from walking after a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a brainwave a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell me if I can recover or to what extent.
It's been an excitement, but I've recovered from everything, I've come back to learn how to walk and today I'm touching on doing agile exercises!
"Thank you for the animated messages!"
An advertisement of gunfire comparing mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tirelet company has shared the opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows that are multiplied.
In order to mark the release of what is considered the "first silenced tirelet that can be brought from the world", the consumer technology company Elvie has issued an advertisement inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that gives the new tirelet to the sea.
Four real mothers dance in a graner full of garbage and cows in the rhythm of a song that includes letters like, "Yes, I am a lot of myself, but you will not see who" and "If you didn't realize it, they're not brags, but my breasts."
The return continues: "Bomb, bomb, feed the babies, bomb, bomb, munyo the girls."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from who has seen it, many of which claim to show the "horrows" of the lactic industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and be pregnant to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after their birth,” a person wrote.

Another person commented: "Comprehensiblely traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But why not use them to announce a tirelet for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: “It’s an advertisement outside of the site.”
Others defended the announcement; a woman admitted that finding the song was "very fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I'd like to buy one if I still had to give birth.
Booming for the shooter made me feel like a cow.
Announcement is a bit crazy, but it must be taken as it is.
It’s a great product,” a user wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump with guns (usually at their workplace or in the washroom) and feels like they were cows.
It’s not an advertisement that lies or judges the lactic industry.”
At the end of the video, women show that they’ve danced all with the tirelet discreetly to supporters.
The concept that the campaign is backwards is based on the perception that many women say they feel as if they were cows when they use the tirelet.
Nevertheless, the Elvie shooter is completely silent, has no cable or tube and fits discreetly into a breastfeeding supporter, making it more freedom for women to move, submit babies and even get out while bombing.
Ana Balarin, mother’s first childhood socia and developer, said: “The Elvie shooter is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative campaign.
By tracing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a tirelet is used and the challenges it is supposed to do, once we demonstrate, entertaining and educational, the incredible sense of freedom that the new tirelet offers.
This isn't the first time the Elvie shooter comes out in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the pastel for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, quietly moved to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of immigrant children retained has increased even though monthly entries through the border have remained practically stable, partly because the rhetoric hardness and policies introduced by Trump administration have made children's parenting difficult.
Traditionally, most fathers were immigrants without papers, who had to put their chances of staying in the country if they decided to adopt a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible parents and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the immigration and immigration control service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to accommodate uncompany minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prejudice.
“Nearly 80% of people who have been home or live at the home of a person who has been home are illegally in the country, and a large majority of them are criminal foreigners.
We will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to process children faster, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to submit themselves to the court within a month after they have been arrested, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, in accordance with refugee workers.
Many of them will appear via video conference, instead of personally, to defend their case to obtain legal status in front of a immigration judge.
All those who are not considered suitable for help will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in custody, the more likely they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramps or attempts to escape, according to the workers and the reports they have given to know the system in the past months.
Lawyers argue that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where more likely, due to their size, will pass high signs indicating that a child is suffering.
They added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that has already suffered.
Syria urges U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Heading to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Muallem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who also acts as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the issue will be treated in consequence."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muallem has insisted that the "terror war has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purified the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and of “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
Muallem has declared that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed “some Western countries” to escape “irrational ones” that make refugees want to stay away.
"We have called for the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicing a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuilding for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the last great rebel bastition, Idlib, has encouraged the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack of Syrian forces with Russia’s aid in the province, where three million people live.
Nevertheless, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed the hope that the military action will face jihadists, including fighters from the Front Al-Nusra, linked to Al-Qaeda, that "they will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, sent from the United Nations, expects to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee, formed by members of the government and the opposition, to begin to profile a post-war constitution and prepare the path towards the elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation to the committee, whose task should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump won for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, scandals and the destitution process ended with his presidency prematurely.
What would certainly be “the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of audiences at maximum audiences has more than doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and practically tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at maximum audience time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show, from MSNBC, led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million audiences in the main news nights.
"People have been prosecuted because they don't understand it," says Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver said he would vote for Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"I answered that because he laughed," Scovell said.
There is a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the Washington script could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if families of immigrants could meet and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can allow.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going beyond when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a group of experts discuss the use Bob Woodward made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Trump's 15,000-dollar constructed leather jacket that was constructed by Paul Manafort, we're going to go beyond when you find a group of experts discussing the use of "private use" sources.
In my case, I won't see Super Mario again.
"Part of what makes it seem to be part of a telereality program is that it gives you something new every night," says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" about the changes in characters and scripts of the Trump program (conversing with the NFL, praise Kim Jong-Un).
You can’t let yourself lose any episode because you stay behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees, and she was alone outside the house on the northern coast of Kauai, but she remained closed looking at the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
It could not be disengaged, not with Brett Kavanaugh to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a wire.
"I remember when we made those shattered programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Fleiss said.
“I thought it would be a kind of joke, but they seemed to have been right.”

External money floods the courses of mid-election elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is not surprising that there is a flood of cash in the 17th Pennsylvania district, thanks to the realization of Congress districts that have made two current members compete for the same place.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburgh's suburb district involves Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who gained the place in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the ancient 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were rejected after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decreed in January that the ancient districts were unconstitutionally divided in favour of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has launched a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after an adjusted victory in highly followed special elections held in March to represent the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
Republicans have been in charge for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points of difference.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support to China, but withdraws them
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response by Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valera, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners took off the Trump Organization’s management team.
Officials of the State Department have decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on ceasing to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Department said this month.
However, it was only considered the possibility of Sanctioning El Salvador, which received US aid of $140 million in 2017, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, including shortened in financial aid and restrictions on visa issued, would be harmful to the Central American country and high numbers of deaths by murder and stop.
With the steps of the internal meetings, officials of both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and it was seen as a step forward to prevent emigrants from being addressed to the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to occur, a fact that it effectively ended with any probability of sanctions for Salvation.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been elected for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance that the administration gives there, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. sendings returned discreetly to their duties of Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions by Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also since anonymous, confirmed its statements.
Study History
The next event could be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump's possible obstacle to justice, of which there are numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller also investigates whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in his attack on the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could be found reporting to the body, just when preparing to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
There are many circumstances, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s fall, neither of any of his European humans, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to strike Hitler, only if the West Block had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed later.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflation such as this and accelerates or backwards the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is currently facing several points of inflation.
What happens if Trump accompany Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Prosecutor General, the man who controls the fate of the investigation on Mueller?
Rosenstein has been with water in the neck since the newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that it was not suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the information from the Times is unprecedented.
"How can we answer if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, in particular, will we vote in half a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will begin to run dangerously.
But I don’t think we’re going to fail because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to fire Shabbat's mirrors on that table with the squash.
With this luggage, why shouldn’t I be optimistic in the future?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers, optimist in front of the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receives the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive empathy in the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to classify himself to the European League G group.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the fourth 2-2 against the Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a trampoline to achieve great results.
“It was a positive point for us, because the Vila-real is a good team,” the 31-year-old player said.
“We’re going to play the game believe we could get a valuable result and we’re going to get out of it with a point.
We might have had something more at the end, but in general, it was probably a fair result.
They were better at the first, but we were better at the second.
On Thursday, it’s another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they took a good result in the last match, but I'm sure we'll give it even though we'll get a good result with the support of affection.
Last year it was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes in the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the training is good.
I hope we can give it all, leave the last season behind and make it successful.”
Women lose sound for savings for retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few people talked about it with the family.
Approximately half of the surveys at national level argue that they have spoken to their partner about the long-term care costs.
Only 10% of the surveys say they have talked to their children.
"People want some family to take care of them, but they do not "have the courage to think about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
You need to start here.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t communicate your wishes in advance enough.
Work with your advisor and your family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Includes your financial adviser in the conversation: it can also help you determine how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term care funding options can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a valuable hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenditure or insurance with your own resources, if you have the necessary money.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to designate a trusted person who monitors your medical attention and make sure that professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can’t communicate with you.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary deposit for your finances.
It is appropriate to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your invoices are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your old family has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor to be determined, but also with which doctors it wants to be treated,” Martin said.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have this plan prepared."
Home Shooted several times with a compressed air split in Ilfracombe
A man received several traces of a compressed air scoop while returning home after leaving for the night.
The victim, about 40, was in the area of Oxford Grove of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
"The officials have described the shooting, which has occurred around 2:30 a.m. (in the British summer time), as a "random act".
The victim hasn't seen his attacker.
His life is not dangerous for the injured and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that dropped the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities.
As communications are cut off, the aid units have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala government, an area in northern Palu closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-sized earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, located on the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends over 300 km off the coast northwest of the island of Célebes.
The province, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299.200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Célebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the coast of the other extreme Célebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Donggala that killed new people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and is usually produced by a certain frequency of earthquakes.
Here are the main earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: On December 26, a large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ace in northern Sumatra caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-sized earthquake pulled out a pop area from the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-sized earthquake dropped one of the Mentawai islands on the coast of Sumatra, provoking a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya’s administration in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population remembered the destruction of the earthquake and the mortal tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, mostly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily captured.
Sarah Palin’s elderly son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the grand son of Alaska’s former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with charges for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old naturalist in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and arrest resistance, according to a Saturday report published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance attempted to call the police to denounce alleged crimes, he stretched out his phone.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su’s temporary detention centre, where he is detained with a $500 warranty-free obligation, according to KTUU.
He appeared to the court on Saturday, when he was declared "not guilty, safely" when he was asked how he was declared, according to the chain.
Palin faces three class A shortcomings, which means he could go to jail for up to one year and have to pay up to $250,000.
It is also accused of a B-class deficiency, which can be punished with one day in jail and $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges are recorded against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska veteran court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in the state of embryos related to the incident.
Her husband said she had given him a shot of punishment in her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups to associate her son's violent behaviour with a posttraumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake took off the Indonesian island of Clebes on Friday.
The 7.5-sized earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks do not work and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake has occurred just on the coast of Central Clebes, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Social networks circulate videos with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect of the New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutors in New York demand death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people: an extraordinary penalty that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, assumed to use a Home Depot rental truck to attack on a bike ride on the West Side Highway, at Lower Manhattan, and to hit riders and cyclists during his journey, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must demonstrate that Saipov killed the eight victims "intensively" and that "intensively" caused severe personal injuries, according to the notice of the intention to request the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could be a death penalty, according to the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal court attacked Saipov with a 22-failed charges that included eight murder charges in favour of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often used in mafia cases, as well as a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Attorneys claimed that the attack required a "relevant planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfully Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the report.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York has brought a case of death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to death for the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to perpetual jail in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being conspired to take spy action for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs died at the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documents, Saipov, nadius of Uzbekistan, did not show regret in the days and months after the attack.
The police explained that he claimed to the investigators that he felt well about what he had done.
According to the charges written, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone.
According to the police, ISIS flag was also asked to be deployed in its hospital room.
He has not been accused of 22 missing charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defenders representing Saipov, claimed they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a permanent chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demanish the death penalty.
Member of the Conservative Party parliament states that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “set the pressure of the Eurosceptics” when one of the members of the parliament of Theresa May suggested that they should lead negotiations with the EU.
The uncharted conservative deputy Peter Bone told Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced when reconciling its deeply divided ranks has been emphasized when the Conservatives in favor of the union have appeared in another protest against Brexit in La City.
The Prime Minister is struggling to preserve its Chequers’ commitment plan between Brexit supporters’ attacks, EU supporters and EU supporters.
The allies insist that they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and press the Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said to having Leave Means Leave of Solihull that he wanted to dismiss Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I will defend Brexit, but we have to dismiss Chequers’ commitment.”
In order to specify its opposition to the EU, he added: “We did not fight world wars for serving.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that claimed that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British population has changed mentality and wants to stay there is completely false.”
Brexit conservative party Andrea Jenkyns also attended the race and stated before reporters: “I only tell you, Prime Minister, listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular among the general public, the opposition will not vote in favour, it is unpopular among our party and our activists, who are the people who go out in the street and achieve we win elections.
"Leave Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: “The prime ministers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that the Mating politicians must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and today we’re here to tell them that we won’t let them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, in the end of betraying Brexit, feel pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the country’s popular troops that gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the union made a trip to Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour miting in the city center.
A small number of activists struck flags on the Conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the Lord's Chamber, Lord Adonis, laughed at the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus agreement, for the border without frictions, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of submitting himself as a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would examine the possibility of being a presidential candidate after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Saturday, Massachusetts’ Democrats talked about their future at an open meeting on the western side of Massachusetts.
Warren, the usual critic of President Donald Trump, is presented for his re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It has been a speculation center on the possibility of recovering Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the format of an open meeting since Trump took his office.
An assistant asked him if he had planned to present himself as a candidate for the Presidency.
Warren said it’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our government that doesn’t work, and this includes a woman in the cup.
One person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the death of LSU's basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson arrest at the ET press conference at 11:00 p.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man of the meter.
Sims, 20, got a shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a knife that finally killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday in the media by 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and got a bit of Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to have been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and brought him to custody to the police department of East Baton District.
Sims, a 2 m younger player who grew up at Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 initiations during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebots per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton achieves world title after team orders deliver his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas stood in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play an important role in the race.
Since the pole position, Bottas has had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton while defeating her position at the first two times and invited Vettel to attack her companion.
Vettel entered boxes before and let Hamilton run with the traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop boxing and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a wheeled action that caused the Ferrari pilot to leave the free inside with the risk of staying out after a double movement to defend the third core.
Max Verstappen started at the last line of the gray and at the end of the first time he was in the seventh position on his 21st anniversary.
Afterwards, he continued in good position much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, move forward to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
Finally he entered the boxes at round 44, but could not increase the rhythm to the next eight times and Raikkonen was in fourth position.
It is a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job throughout the weekend and was a true master who told him to let me pass.
The team has done a great job to have one-and-a-half,” Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual abuse.
In a míting in West Virginia, the president did not talk directly about Ford's witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he commented that what was going to the Senate demonstrated that people are "wrong, cruel and liars."
“A thing that could happen and the most beautiful of what’s going on in the Senate in the last days, when you see anger, when you see people angry, evil, cruel and liar,” he said.
“When you look at the communications and filters and say, ‘No, I wasn’t me.
I haven't been myself."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you want to filter?
Remember your answer... did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
No, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn't filter him," he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter that detailed Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and filtered himself in September, but Feinstein denied that the filtering came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's statements, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to be confidential and I kept it confidential, as she asked me."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented on the Saturday night's minding: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defence of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of inadequate sexual behaviour by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purpose.
"They are determined to recover power from the necessary means.
You will see evil, cruelty, no matter those who do wrong, who must atropelle to have power and control,” said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the Friday defeat in the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return match 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained an advantage of two goals thanks to the ends of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team’s level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants’ advantage.
Francois Bouchard matched the Dundee and then two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe men, who came to win the Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the three previous matches.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand to the fourth minute at 3:35, from Kendall McFaull's assistance. Four minutes later, with David Rutherford's assistance, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial agitation period, Sullivan relocated the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equator at 15:16.
Dwyer guaranteed the advantage of the Giants in the first pause when he achieved the second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team responded and again, Bouchard contributed to its level with a powerful goal at a minute 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen give Dundee the advantage for the first time during the match at the end of the second part and guaranteed the victory of his team with the fifth goal near the end of the match.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five matches, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next Friday match.
Air controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an airplane of an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after he died to ensure that an aircraft with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a large earthquake has pulled out the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
There are many replicas in the area and there are many people caught among the runs in the city of Palu.
But despite his companions escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at the tremendous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stayed in his place to make sure the Batik 6321, which was on the track at that time, could take the flight safely.
Then he went out of the air traffic control tower when he thought he was getting drunk.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“This broke our heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has announced that access to cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the runs and there are still many who haven't been able to access," the representative of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The clouds, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, which will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
Armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying help and cruises.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, explained to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings dead bodies.
Drinking water is low.
“All the minimums have been successful.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia works against watches to help survivors, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could still get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the armed forces: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lake
The airline operating an airplane that will be installed in a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although they have previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had securely evacuated the plane that was inundated.
Air Niugini said in a statement that, since Saturday afternoon, there was no passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to try to find it.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local embarks helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane fell to the water while trying to land at Chuuk Islands airport.
The authorities reported on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and they were all in good condition.
The reason for the accident and the exact sequence of the events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane loved the lake because the track remained short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has crossed the highway.
U.S. Passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was very low.
“This was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to walk with water through the belt until the airplane’s emergency exit, which was shining.
He said the helpers of the flight had panic and started crying, and he suffered a mild wound to his head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby to improve a milk also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport people affected to land before the plane was shipping around 30 meters from the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG recorded airlines accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
Analyst composed a night history that burned a woman alive
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst from the Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described the jury how he used the mobile phone records to build the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, who died the night.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was on the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had lying, as his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed he was doing a couple of weeks that Chambers knew when he died.
The telephone records indicated that it was only a week that they knew.
Rowlett said, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"She removed her from her life," said Hale.
The defense plans to start its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the court to be held in the hands of the jury during the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills its music with positive messages to challenge the negative vision of the genre.
The High Breed, Bristol, assures that the hip-hop has separated from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to return to their roots and make the hip-hop conscious again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resorging in the United Kingdom of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Mainadera from NY asks a couple to be arrested after a "racist" message
A New York minnair reported a couple for a discriminatory confusion after receiving a badly directed text message from the mother where she protested because she was "a different black person."
The couple refuses to be racists and compare demand with a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed consternation to seeing that the new minera, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
“OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBB,.”
But instead of sending him to his husband, he sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After recognizing her piffy, a "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman congratulated Mrs. Maurice, all claiming that the minera that she had congratulated, which was Afro-American, had done her work badly and she expected a Philippine person, according to the New York Post.
Maurice received the payment corresponding to her workday and then sent her home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice claims a compensation to the couple and requests a compensation of about USD 350 per day for the six-month work resident for which they had contracted it, although there was no contract.
"I want to show them that things can't be done like that," he said on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to the statements that they are racists all claiming that Maurice's commitment was the most reasonable, since they had to be able to not trust her after having offended her.
“My wife sent him something I didn’t want to say.
He's not racist.
“We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco said in the Post.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you were groaning, even if it was wrong?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the demand with a "extortion," said that his wife had left him two months to have a baby and that he was in a "very difficult situation."
“Do you want to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very friendly attitude,” the investor added.
The legal case is not yet resolved and the court of public opinion has hurried to denounce the partner on social networks and condemn its behavior and its logic.
Paddington’s editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a bone that talks, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said in relation to the letter: “It’s hard to put in place someone who read it for the first time before her publication.
It’s very grateful, now we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the child's book on a little hairy bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "arrogant", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and suggests that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumption," he said.
“But as Paddington was as real for him, it was practically as when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not yours.
I think it was Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
When they landed, they brought their daughter to Nizza’s Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where the doctors worked to save her life.
“Nad often called to say it was too hard and they didn’t expect it to overcome,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I called Nad and told me that I would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll go with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs that were given to him because his body continued to beat was consumed and out of his system.
He had died before what was planned, and so everything was removed.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and more people.
I had to keep the good shapes.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, landed on the plane with the rest of the passengers, distant from the experience he was going through.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head and tears stopped falling.
It's hard to explain, but during the year I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad aclaparador.
The feeling I needed my love and my understanding.
I know I wanted him a lot."
Woman's love to pay cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been pushing cards on a gallery bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from a depression and died at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
45-year-old Davis, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that their smile could illuminate any room.”
However, he left his job before he died because he was at a "very dark point."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at that time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "because people know there are people who can come to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t be silent: you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"I never said it wasn't good or depressed or anything like that," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He touched the Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts and he didn’t look at them or anything.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to work: “Open a hole for the family.
We're left.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future goes on a wire while FBI starts an investigation
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for (an investigation with a range and a limited time), we could get a certain unit," Mr. Flake said Saturday.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
His reticence has to do with the moment.
Only five weeks are lacking for the mid-mandate elections of 6 November. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, weaknesses will be seen at achieving that the man who wishes to go out will arrive to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and press them to pick up Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as it was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to dismiss the court and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean desertors "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korean desertors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un arrived in power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, all citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions were produced last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices covering traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Usually, the vast majority of North desertors are offered by South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea, and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant desertors, instead of refugees, and often repatriates for force.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still in war, have significantly improved in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on stop-off negotiations on denuclearization.
This took place after the historical meeting of the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in general to achieve a Korean peninsula free of nuclear power.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not disarma ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteria" and is not fit to work at the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber Nancy Pelosi said the candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, is a "hysteriatic" and its temperament is the incapacity to work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have told him that it was a "hysteria," Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the accusations of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh showed himself very excited, sometimes shouting and staying without words while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He also expressly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him were a "grote and coordinated murder of a character" organized by the liberals' angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's witness proved that he could not work at the Supreme Court, as he showed his injuries against the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi showed retention when asked if he would try to appeal to Kavanaugh’s election, if it is confirmed, and if Democrats achieve the majority in the House of Representatives.
“This is what I can say: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only not able to be in the Supreme Court but also in the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh exercises as a judge at the Court of Appeal for the District Circuit of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was worried about the decisions she could take against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time for a hysterical person to enter the court and expect us to seem wonderful,” Pelosi said.
Women must exercise their power.
It is a justification: months and years of a lot of anger and can't pull it out without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a little common."
She continued: “I helped a woman who was a executive somewhere that told me that she was crying when I was angry, but she was developing a tactic that consisted of when she was angry and began to cry, telling the person she was talking to: “You think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then continued.
I'll look brilliant."
Tears are allowed to come out for rabbit in part because, basically, they misinterpret themselves.
One of the most clear memories I have from one of my first work in a male majority office, where I once finished crying with an undescriptible sweat, is that of a larger woman (a cold directive that had always terrorized me) who took me from the clay and threw me to the eye of the sword.
"Never let them see you crying," he said.
“I don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and will be glad because they will have you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Deputy of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered in an extramarrial adventure on a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the career, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason to not explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a well meditated decision,” she told me while she laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone said, "Blancaneu and the seven nans."
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was enraged with the recapture of funds, so he promised he wouldn't access the race if he didn't recapture $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to men were only willing to give 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When he pronounced his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (thankful for the people who helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of taking money and focusing on voters, instead of doing so to the delegates, and rape, and sexism) that it remained unforgettable.
"It might have been thought I had a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press reaction.
“I could have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I'm wondering what they're going to put in my tomb.
"Will he cry?"
How the U.S. and China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of the trade war between the U.S. and China were alarming and, although the war does not seem to have to end quickly, a distance between countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he imposed taxes on China's major exports, such as solar plates, steel and aluminum.
The most significant scale occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth $200,000 billion. These tariffs represent a taxation on half of all goods arriving in the US from China.
Beijing has contracted each time in the same way and has recently risen the rates from five to ten percent to $60,000 billion of American goods.
China has committed to replying the U.S. and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon be done.
To make Washington back involves giving up some demands, but publicly clinging to the U.S. would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, pressures from trade war with the U.S. could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than the witnesses had predicted," says Abigail Grace, Asian researcher at Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says she is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of over seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
“Actually, the situation in the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that terrorists destroyed to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would thank any help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he noted that he would not accept conditional assistance or the help of the countries that financed the insurgency.
Europe's selection achieves victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European selection has won the 2018 Ryder Cup in defeating the U.S. selection with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European selection again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the outlet of water in the hole by 316, ceding the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shine all of his series and became one of the four players who have achieved the 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was separated with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European selection Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, England, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
With eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, he became the biggest winner the tournament ever had, with 25.5 race points.
“I don’t just cry, but today I can’t avoid it.
It has been a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup recovered.
The team is the most important... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” an excited Garcia commented after European victory.
He is a member of his compatriot John Ram, who defeated the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a race record at the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever existed, with 14 big wins and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. selection fought the entire weekend to search for the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s frustrating performance: “I’m proud of these players, they have fought.
This morning was a moment when we pushed the European election.
We fought.
I'm going to take the bar for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We will cooperate, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to have been their captain.
There's to pull the bar.
He was defeated."
