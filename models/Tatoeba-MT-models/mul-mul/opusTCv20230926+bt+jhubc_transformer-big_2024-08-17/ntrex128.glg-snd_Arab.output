Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama are afraid of being ridiculated.
A member of the Labour Party said that he was concerned with his group that the new name "living with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not know galés, "twp" means "pure" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Party Plaid Cymru manifested that the group's set "not satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A conservative galley said that his group maintains a "open mind open" about name change, but he stressed that from MWP to Muppet there's only a small jump verbal.

"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
"The bars are no longer the rooms of the neighborhoods that the people normally go."
"At the churches, they fear that the money of asset sales does not last so much as leaders expect, and " soon or later they'll return where they started".
He said that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities full of owners of the type of people that would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuary.
"The immense majority of the people who will buy apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and, consequently, they will accelerate the loss of all these churches, because it's unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches."
The two churches were constructed by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin decades later.

Investment in beauty produces in a moment where supermarkets seek to fill the stoves that in their day occupied TVs, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offer of beauty products up to 3,000 products, including first brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain more space with exclusive zones similar to those that can be seen in stores like Boots.
Supermarket is also rebuilt its range of makeup Boutique makeup so that the majority of the products can be fit for vegans, something more and more demanded by the newest customer.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.

Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the establishments will look more and more like shopping centers, since supermarket chains try to compete with discount tents like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos's and Habitat's Points of Sale in a hundred Tents, since he bought two chains for two years ago. According to seeing, this strengthened sales of food foods and gained profits for acquisitions.

Why did you give President Trump so much?
Trump said putting his voice as a "Telexornal representative".
"Don't give anything."
He said Kim is interested in maintaining a second meeting after his initial meeting held in Singapore in June, that Trump considers a big step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization have been stopped.
More than three fish after the summit of June in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho, told leaders of the world at the UN General Assembly Saturday that North doesn’t see the "correspondent response" by the US to the first measures of North Korea’s disarmament.
In contrast, he stressed, the US continues to impose sanctions intended to continue exerting pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his mitin speech.
"All things with North Korea are good," he said.
"Vi ville gå til krig med Nordkorea.
Million people would have died.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He affirmed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: end tests with missiles, help liberate reprivates and make back home the remaining US soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy, talking about Kim's relationships.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this amphitheatre, we would have about 200 people from here," Trump said.
A tsunami and a tsunami devastate Island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was deplasated, no national catastrophe was declared, which is a condition indispensable for catalization of international assistance.
"Desfortunately, in many cases, they made very clear that they didn't call for international assistance, so it's a challenge," she said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it's still unclear whether alien personal can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for National Agency for Disaster Management, has affirmed that Indonesian officials are evaluating situation in Palu to see if international agences can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquake that constantly supports Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to confronte the fury of nature.
Although in Aceh were constructed refugees for tsunamis, it's not normal to find them in other sides.
Although a warning is issued, absence of tsunami warning sirena in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
Neither better than two cases, traveling between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural catastrophes make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship, which was deployed in Lombok to meet victims of the earthquake, is going to Palu, but it takes at least three days to get a place of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo’s election campaign rushed around the improvement of Indonesia’s deteriorated infrastructure, and earned money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final rect at the reelection next year.
Mr. Joko is also influenced by continual sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a way to live more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were assassinated, and decenas de miles were obligated to abandone their homes because of the confrontation on the streets of Christian bands and Muslims, using machetes, arcs, arcs, frets, and other rudimentary weapons.

The iconoclast of the British Civil Wars was not ordained or executed by Cromwell.
If the frame would have sacrificed Cromwell incorrectly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell performed by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a test of opinion existing in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in front of external pressure, in this case, of course, was monarchie.
Whether this is or not a total representation is objected by a continuu historic debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure representing a side of division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also meritable of celebration and commemoration."

The remains of the Rosa furacan will bring strong and generalized rain to Southwest US.
The predictions indicate that the Rosa furacan weakens as it overflows cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring turning rain to North Mexico and Southwest US in the next few days.
Rosa was a hurricane of category 1 with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hopefully Rosa moves north or Sunday.

Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico o Monday.
Next, interaktion of tropical moisture with valve will create abundant and generalized rain in the southwest in the next few days.
A local level, precipitation between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous inondations, flood flows, and possibility of desolation of land in the desert.
Gross tropical humidity will cause precipitation which will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in points areas, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts southwest expect 50 to 100 l/m2 rain, particularly in large part of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with conditions deteriorated due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We were not assertively advised to go in the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
The rain could form canons, which could be transformed into rivers floating, and the electric storms would bring locally rack winds and po.
The valada will bring locally strong rain to parts of Southern Coast of California.
Total precipitation could be over 12 l/m2, which, in turn, could cause flow of smaller crashes and steadfast roads.
These would be the first rainfalls of the wet station of the region.
The tropical rainfalls will start to reach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and first hours of Monday, before the rainfalls spread at the end of Mondays and Tuesdays.

Kavanaugh, who was in love with a witness, said that he was totally convinced that that's not happening.
Nielsen reported Friday that more than 20,4 million people would have seen him.
The company told media audiences in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other chains other than retransmitted, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems to measure people who watch TV from offices.
In order to make an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supports Kavanaugh's appointment, has led all chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers in an average of 5.69 million viewers during a trial that lasted the whole day, according Nielsen, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3,26 million.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89, CNN 2,52 million Second Nielsen.
After jurisprudence, interest continues.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's TV.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement indicating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning by protesters when he attempted to enter a ascensor of the way to the audience of the Judiciary Committee.
He stayed with the low view for a few minutes while he was replayed, live TV at CNN.

All TV chains and cables were transmitted live hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to move Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to submit to vote.
But Flake said that I would do this only if FBI investigated claims against the nominated next week, which instaured a minority of demokrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations maintained with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation later with Coons and several senators, Flake took a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was evident that Republicans wouldn't have the promises to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump initiated investigations for claims against Kavanaugh.

Announcement between Police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced anti-disturbance police and while thousands of people joined rival protests to celebrate the first anniversary of polarizing polarization vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked proseparatists contained by police anti-disturbance wheeled eggs and paint where they created dark-pow clouds on the streets that typically are atheized by tourists.
Later, after that day, the Police and the Police, bespoke the guards of the horses.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who "never forget or forgive" confronted Unionist protesters who cried "Long Life to Spain".
14 people were injured by mild wounds received in protest, according to local press.
The tension continues to bloom skin in the independentist region a year after the referendum of 1 October held by catalán separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
The voters voted favorably for independence, although the participation was low, and the opponents of the boicot secession voted favorably.
According to Catalan authorities, approximately 1,000 people were wounded last year after police attempted to stop voting at election tables throughout the region in violent confrontation.
The pro-independent groups camped on Friday's whole night to prevent a demonstration of support to the national police.
The manifestation occurred likewise, but they believed that they were obliged to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old electricist who went to independence demonstration with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes in the possibility of Catalonia to obtain independence.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
“Everything is not true, but it is not true, and it is not true, but it is true.”

Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanik, who recorded demonstration in support of police with his mobile, said that conflict was alimentated by politicians of both sides.
"Every time there's more tension," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Katalonian leaders in preventive prison since last year, announced Saturday that next year will be presented in elections to the European Parliament.
"Presentation as candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he added.

The uplifted Livingston surprised Rangers leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise up a level after the Hibernian, in second position.

But before Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in Europa League Thursday.
Livingston continues to be invicted in the division for sixth consecutive match; the main coach, Holt, yet does not know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler or my past.
Livingston allows you to escape opportunities for weak visitors
Holt's team must have advanced long before they marked the moment, since with his control caused all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened a path but his crossed shooting didn't cross the portfolio threshold; then, Alan Lithgow shooting went out driven by a Craig Halkett's head head from the other side of portfolio threshold.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, conscious that they could put the visitors in danger of playing the stopped ball.
That's how the goal came to be decisive.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson united their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession, but was adorned with an impenetrable defence that prevented him much work from guard Liam Kelly.
That master continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's stop.
Rangers' guardian, Allan McGregor detained a shot of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sendte the ball out of another game of a Livingston parade balloon.
There have been a lot of cross-passes in the area of Livingston which were constantly displaced, while two requests for penalti were rejected: one hand and the other by Halkett's entrance to Glenn Middleton substitute.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
́E unanimity, they were excellent and continue to overcome expectations in their ascending trajectory.
Hans gambling style and gamers just changed since he returned to top category, but part of the merit was Holt for the way that led team from his arrival.
I had many heroes.
Halkett, Captain Halkett, ruled superbly a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not give them a breath or a breath during all the match to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Ao Rangers faltoulles inspiration.
Although they worked well under Gerrard's order times, this time they didn't get that level.
They failed the last step. They only managed to penetrate host team once. All Rangers' calls of attention, that's in half the table.

The Rosa furacan threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (places affected by the dryness could benefit)
It's rare that a tropical depression affect Arizona, but it's very likely that it will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa furacan crosses the Southwest Desert, leaving possibility of brushed floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued alarms of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday of Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hopefully Rosa passes direct to Phoenix or Tuesday and arrives last hour of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorology Service of Phoenix indicated in a Twitter post that only "tyn tropical cyclones would "conserve the state of depression or tropical storm in a 320km radius from Phoenix from 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane that extended to a radio of 64 km from Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service predict 50-10 l/m2 of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 150l/m2 in Bordo Mogollón de Arizona.
Other areas of Southeast Desert, such as Central Rochosas and Gran Conca, could reach 25 or 50 litres, with possible total isolation of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden floods, Rosa rain could be a blessing, since the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, since Southwest is experiencing dryness.
According to U.S. Dryth Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experimenting at least extreme Dryth, the second largest category", according to weather.com.
First, the Rosa furacan will touch land on the Low California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa Rosa, which will still have a force of furacan furacan on Sunday Sunday morning, with a wind of a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexiko, and it'll move north north a 19 km/h.
La tempesta, which surrenderes in abundance of cold waters, is the Pacific, and is the strength of the world.
For this reason, it is expected that he will touch the land in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the evening or Monday night.
In some regions of Mexico, it could be rain intensely, assuming a major risk of flood.
"Esperate total precipitation between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, which is possible to be found with up to 250 l/m2", reports weather.com.
Rosa then headed north through Mexico in form of tropical storm before reaching Arizona border the first hour of Tuesday as tropical depression, and then continues to ascend through Arizona and enter south Utah last hour of the night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of the sound are strong precipitations in Baja California, Northwest of Sonora, and Southwest Desert of the USA."
We hope that these rain may cause improvised trombs of water, and fluences in the desert, and delusion of the earth in the mountains.

Kanye West rapper change the name of Ye polo
The rapper Kanye West change the name of Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "One being previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, is known as Ye, who used as title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurred before its appearance in Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who canceled his assistance by "emotional motives", according to the creator of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word the most used in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'ti'," said West that same year while talking about his disc with Big Boy radio shower.
“I am you, we are you, we are you.
I have passed from Kanye, which means the only Ye, which is a reflection of goodness that exists in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is a more reflection than we are."
Kanye is one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year announced that he preferred to call him Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also embraced to put and remove the script and use the mainusculas.
AMLO's compromise not to use military against civils
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised not to use military force against civils again when it reaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody represalia against students.
López Obrador promised Saturday on Tlatelol Square that "I'll never use the military again to reprime the Mexican people".
On 2 October 1968, the troops shooted on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were swallowing across Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to boys who study and opening more public universities for free.
"He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities brings guys to bands criminals.
US should double investing in I.A.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, ex-employed of Google, Microsoft and Apple, USA, the investor and professional of IA Kai-Fu Lee, should double the amount invested in IA in terms of China's growing activity in the field.
Comments were produced after several parts of the US government made announcements about IA, even if the US lacks a formal strategy about IA.
China was presenting its plan the previous year: it plans to be number 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
"Duplicating the budget of research in IA would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are much further behind than the USA, and we are looking for next big progress in IA", said Lee.
Duplication of financing could duplicate the probability that the next IA achievement in the field of IA was done in the USA, Lee said to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent IA companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, she worked in a IA system that won American Othello player with a high score and later was executive of Microsoft Research at the Google branch office in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology contests as Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify next visionary.
In America, researchers normally have to work a lot to get money from government, says Lee.
"China isn't who leads academic leaders, it's who leads companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired college genios to work in IA.
Lee stressed that change in immigration policy could also help the US to boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in IA", he said.

"Today, I voted for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a life safeer for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79-year-old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally bindant, many Members of Parliament said they would agree with the result of voting and they would make it definitive.
The 9th Change would need a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
State Electoral Committee argued, at 1 p. m. No registre irregularities.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of voters registered voted deposed their vote.

"We are for joining NATO and EU, but we want to do so with high head and not for serving gate," he added Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
“If you do not accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Union of Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev affirme that NATO adhesion a NATO will bringe Masedonia investing in such a necessity, with a unemployment rate over 20 per cent.
"I think that the vast majority will be favorable because over 80 per cent of our citizens are favorable for joining EU and NATO", he added.
He said that a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Makedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in referendum, a figure that is below demand.
Another survey by Macedonia Television Chain Telma indicated that 57 per cent of the consulted people planned to vote Sunday.
Dees, 70 per cent said he would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the result must be 50% plus 50% plus 1 vote.

Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses Brighton’s defence and finally marks a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defenced Brighton with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made that seemed ridiculously simple to mark the goal of the 65 minute.

Then Aguero was found round about four green camisoles.
He sniffed a defence before he crossed several more on the edge of the Brighton area.

The English fronter used the first token area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton Mathew Ryan's guardian with a shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero is going through some problems on the pe," said City coach Pep Guardiola, reporters.
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

But Sterling was the one who gave the first advantage of the Premier League.

Scherzer wants to celebrate Rockies
With Nationals outside of the fight for elimination, there were no many reasons to force another possession.
But a competitive Scherzer always expects to lanse Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but there's only implications in elimination for Rockies, which leads a partition of favor to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the comedyn with 5-2 victory over Nationals Friday night over the Nationals, but they continue to try to close their first division title.
"Although we didn't play anything, we can at least touch the gum knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with another team would probably play the highest level that I played this year.
"Why don't I want to compete with that?"
The Nationals yet have not announced who will be open Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to be that Scherzer would be what starts in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for who would be his initial number 34, made another bullpen session Thursday and probably will launch Sunday on his usual Sabbath day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 tickets this season.

The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It's not tolerable with those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censorate me, the truth is that I didn't surprise me too much.
After all, it's the last series of working Members who aren't well accepted, and you're all going to tell us about our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan was treated similarly because he faced decision-making antisemitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.

The notification for the working meeting of Nottingham East on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
"Last eight-years I've been working as a working deputate, the meetings of the committee on Friday night were just like that.
Desafortunately, that's no longer the ton of many meetings, and the promise of a policy "more friendly and sensitive" was forgotten long ago, if it once started.
"It's more and more evident that the labourist party does not tolerate different opinions and ask if all opinions are acceptable for the leader of the parti.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader of the party, when companions with those who planned to share a similar political vision began to wait for me to retratarate and adopt postures with which I would never agree, whether in terms of national security as of EU Single Market.
"When I speak publicly, and in fact a little like what I say, there's a tremendo and assault on social media censorating the central policy, telling me that it shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
He's not only me.
In fact, I know that I'm more lucky than some of my companions, because the comments that are addressed to my are usually of political character.
Impress me the professionality and determination of companions who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not abandone.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this era of politics is how the level of insult has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we are no longer so open and that, with every movement of "non-confidence" or any change in the rules of selection, partition becomes more stricter than targeted.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An invict Ayr puts in head
It is possible that the last two attempts may change final results a little bit, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win this lowly match of the Premier League of Tenent Premier League.
Now they're heading the board and it's the only invicto team of 10.
Ultimately, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, led the team to victorie. Peter Murchie, coach, had all right to be happy.
"Now we're testing our match and we're still invicted, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "That's got to know that Ayr has profited of the better opportunities than us."
The trial of Grant Anderson on the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put forward the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to match by Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot pampered a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage for Ayr with penalti, before, just in half-time, transformed a shooting into solo, leaving the marker 17-5 for Ayr in rest.
But Melrose started well the second half, and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who abandoned the field in padiola and, since the restart, Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowall test, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took the game to have a player more with Bruce Colvine's test of Bruce Colvine than he didn't consume, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for Climo to score Climo when he was unable to have the ball, McPjherson scored a test from the line of penalti line on the back of Ayr's maul's back.
Climo marked, as it did almost since restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in David Armstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test from the local team.

Evo Morales, the charismatic indian president of Bolivia, who faced a controversial bataille for reelection next year, also has a lot of game in Monday judgment.
“We are very ready to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider unlikely that the tribunal would give Bolivia the reason, and that little would change if that would happen.
The United Nations Agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilen territory, and stated that it will not determine the result of possible conversations.

And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be delayed screen.
"Theme of access to the sea takes much time blocked by the current boliviana administration," says Zárate.
Morales's retoric belgarant gave a goodwill to stay in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will restart conversations sometime, but it will be very difficult to keep them afterwards.
The two countries have been substituted for ambassadors since 1962.
The ex-president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Haag, rejected the idea that the tribunal would not take an unusually rapid decision.

I invited US to fulfil promises made during a meeting in Singapore among their leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been launched for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "utopia" that the continual sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korea War can double North.
In Washington, they refrain from accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's generalized skepticism that Pyongyang speaks seriously about abandoning an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump comedy.
Paris Fashion Shows reveal the last line of gigantic blacks that will soon be in tents.
If you want to increase your collection of clouds, or if you want to cover all the sun, do not seek any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the crossroads a series of extravagant accessories for their spring- Summer 2019 collection which opened the public with the purest style of the Paris Fashion Week style.
The impossible darkers have filled Instagram this summer, and these designers have driven it through their most amazing creations.
The main piece of Valentino was a exacerbated beige hat ornamentated with a large tab imitant plumes, which inundated the heads of models.
Among other aksesuarys of great size, there were sandals, a chain of magic and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head of cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Much of the colorful masks had the lips crushed and seemed more like Hannibal Lecter than the high-cut.
One of the creations looked like a full set of bulbs, eyelashes and tubes, and the other was a bulbs of jewel.
If you're a great fashionist, you're a good idea.
The wise men in fashion thought that the giants could enter the tent.

As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized study plan, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable theme within schools.

This is a powerful reminder that we can't depend only on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people of other countries.
From the results of recent exams of this year, we can see that languages are at the highest of the tableboard and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of the studentes who studied foreign languages received a great deal.
The data, recompilated from 74 SCIS schools, show that 72% of the students received honor in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, 69% of those who studied French, 63% of those who studied French, 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an oversight.

Today, languages are the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
In 2014, a survey by the Commission for Employment and Training of the United Kingdom (Commission for Employement and Training for the United Kingdom) showed that the lack of knowledge of languages represented 17% of the reasons why employers cost them to cover vacation.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare youth for their future career.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, since there are more labor possibilities than they need languages.
Independently of your chosen career, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with a life skills like this.
Be able to communicate directly with people of other countries will place a two-language person directly to the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults British in 2013, 75% of them didn't speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, in this case 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in a language for children today.
The knowledge of various languages, especially those of developing economies, provides more opportunities for children to find a significant job.
In Scotland, teaching languages vary according to school.
Some schools are focused on the most classical modern languages, while others are delighted by languages considered the most important for UK from 2020, such as mandarin or japanese.
Independent from the interests of your children, private schools always have several languages to elixir and specialist professors in this field.

We can't negate that in this moment, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.

Waiting has almost finished for the singers who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
The team coach, Like Walton, announced that James would play the initial match of pre-temporary match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.

What time is Trump’s mitin in West Virginia and how can you see it online?
The mitin of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday 29 September 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's mitin in West Virginia following via YouTube live retransmission.
Trump will probably discuss the theme of the judgment held this week week to the candidate to Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who remained tender for accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior and keeping the vote of Senate confirmation for a week while FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of media is to help the Republicans face November elections with a new impulse.
Hence, these five medians Trump will give next week are the objectives of "dynamizing voluntarys and sympatizers, while Republicans try to protect and expand majorities of their own in Senate and Senate and Chamber of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congres control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible from face to face of the campaign season," he said a spokesman of Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be nominated.
The mitin of this night, which will take place at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather sympathizers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and obtain coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the survey.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to support him in the investigations," said Simon Haeder, politolog de la University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and maintain live hope until individual matches Sunday
After three individual sessions, the foursome of Saturday afternoon might have been able to be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulsive impulse is a totally invented sport concept, but in what the sportists believe true, and especially in such competitions.
"Oh, where do you think that this is the end of the day?"
"I've had a advantage of six points and now they're four, so I suppose that we take this as a little impulsion," said Jordan Spieth while marching at the end of the day.
In fact, Europe has four points of advantages with 12 more in game.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in favor and a lot to animate, among other things, Spieth and Justin Thomas technique, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth letal from tee to green and preached the illustration.
These gutural berries became stronger as they advanced their round, making a putt crucial to match the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
"When I got the putt that gave them to win the match No. 15, I got a similar beer, the type of beer that I said he think the American team is still out.
"You must only concentrate and take care of your party," Spieth said.
..he's the only one left to these players now.
18 holes.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable history.
The strange, but adorable European couple has 4 and can't be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and non last nine holes Friday morning.
"Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th Th
Preferring to be two at the same time in different holes.
However, to speak about European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hurriedly dismiss Sergio García, the hero of the fourballs of the morning, when he embraced with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that never had been near to go out.
In the first day of the week, every one of you should not go down to the tomb.
The fourballs and the foursomes are so fascinating to see blackly the interactions between the couples, the tips they give, the ones they don't and the way they can change a strategy in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the last day, but this foursome session has also demonstrated that the US Team has endured to fight, things that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a advantage of 10-6 the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after leaving fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over USA.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the cargo with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to ascend four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who seeks to preserve the trofee they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a US team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
U.S. has offered more resistance in foursomes, winning four matches, but they couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points of the 12 individual matches Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European invader to win four points followed by, while he and Molinari, "Molliwood", acquired "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend of sensational sensation, is the second couple to win four points from the initial four matches in the Ryder Cup history history.
After winning Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they matched perfectly to defeat a devastated Woods and American novator Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categories.
Woods, who disputed two matches on Saturday without regret or joy, showed occasional rafales of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and foursomes and foursomes and five follow-ups.
Justin Rose, who rushed in the fourballs of the morning, resumed as his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, sending a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win in a nice wind day in Southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth Champion and Justin Thomas have fixed the point of reference for Americans obtaining two points Saturday.
John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs win 2&1 in Spain, and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in Ryder Cup history where a team ascends four points in individuals, although as the current owner of the trofee, Furyk's team only needs to empatize to preserve it.
But after the second best of two days, the first attack on Sunday is just out of the tomb.
Cora do Norte no to unilateral disarmament if you don't trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations Saturday that the continual sanctions increased their desperation in the United States and that the country would not deliver their nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho has notified the annual General Assembly that North Korea has adopted "important measures to demonstrate its good will" last year, such as stop tests nuclear and with missiles, demontage fields of nuclear testing and commitment to proliferation of weapons and technology nuclear.
"Maither, we don't see correspondent response by US US.", he added.
"Unconfidenceless US will not have confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, will not have unilateral disarmament first by our part."
"At that time, while Ri resumed the well-known North Korea's already known North Korea's complaints about the resistance of Washington's resistance to Washington to a "gradual" "gradual denuclearization" under which North Korea would be rewarded as North Korea would would be rewarded as it took measures as it took measures, its statement seemed important, it seemed important, since it didn't renew the unilateral unilateral denuclearization as it did did in the past Pyongyang Pyongyang Pyongyang.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first summit between a US president active and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim committed to "denuclearization" of Korean Peninsula" while Trump guarantees North Korea's security.
North Korea seeks since birth a formal final for Korean War 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang first must deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted to relax the hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"United States insiste on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal of forced etituity, and even oppose "declaration of end of war"," Ri said.
"Perception de que sanctions can make us axial is a dream impossible for those who don't know us.
"But problem is that continue sanctions agitate our desconfidence."
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader mentioned in the United Nations early week.
However, he spoke about three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in in the past five months and added: "If another part of this theme of denuclearization was South Korea and not USA, denuclearization of Korean peninsula wouldn't have reached a dead point".
The tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from the last year, when he said to UN General Assembly, it was inevitable to attack United States with North Korean missiles after Trump’s “bad president” Trump called Kim Kim Kim’s name Kim’s “home rocket in a suicide mission.”
"Trump said that this year in UN UN UN, Trump, Trump, that he said that last year he threatened with "fullfullfullly "destroying entirely" North Korea North Korea, he voted Kim for the courage of Kim for his courage while taking action to take action for the disrealization, but he said that there is still a lot work to work to do it and and that sanctions must be maintained until until North North Korea is.
Trump said, "Non there was no time for that, and that's like two years, three or five months."
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should be rewarded Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of the United States, declare to the UN Security Council: "Underfollowing of Sanctions of the Security Council must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the total denuclearization, final, and verified".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang Nuclear Programs and Balistic Missile Programs.
Pompeo joined Ri at the march of UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip wasn't good.
Pyongyang resignated in July, affirming that he had progressed, just a few hours before North Korea declared him for making "requests of mafia nature".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to demontage missiles, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "relevant measures".
Kim said that Kim had told him that "medidas correspondentes" que he demanded were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Have a Course on How to Relax Sufficiently
This year, a new course at Harvard University is making all its students sleep more in order to fight the growth of the Machist culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
One academic found that students of the university number one in the world often ignore the fundamental aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Muller, conceived the course, who believes it is the first of this type in the USA.
Inspired to start the course after giving a conversation about the impact that the lack of sleep had in learning.
"At the end of the course, I found a young girl and said to me, 'Why do you only tell me this now, in my last year?'
" " " " "," said said," said," said said," said said said said that no no anyone had had had said said said had had had him about about about about the importance to to sleep sleep, that, which which which which which which which surprise surprise surprise me,"," ",",",","," said said said said said said said said said said said said said said said said."."."."." said said said said said said said."."."."."."."
The course, which started this year for the first time, explains to students the fundamental aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits help with academic and atletic performance, as well as improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and CEO of University Health Services, said that the university decided to present the course after finding that the students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The duration of an hour course implies a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on caffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletics performance, as well as the importance of having a routine routine at the time of sleep.
In another section, informe the participants about how long-term deficit of sleep may increase risk of heart attacks, stroke cerebral, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the attitude of students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know this information, in the same way we have the right to know what the impact on health if we choose to smoke tobacco", said Professor Czeisler.
Culture of pride of spending every night awakening still exists, says she. And adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students that implicated lack of sleep was a growing problem.
guarantee that you sleep enough enough and that you have a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, signal, signal. Even avoid anxiety, as deficiency of sleep makes the brain enter a way of inaniation, which makes him hunger constantly.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physic biology, assisted Professor Czeisler to design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course throughout the campus.
The next step, hope, is to request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to consider the option of setting a alarm to sleep, as well as when they wake up. Likewise, it is advisable they should be aware of the negative effects of "blue light" that emit the electronic screens and LED lighting, which may debalance the circadian pace and cause trouble sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gol derruba Gerrard Homes
Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack retweeted Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team planned to record his first home victory since the 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team led Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team at eight Hearts points, leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scotland League League.
Menga attacked 7 minutes before resting and a line of Rangers with little inspiration never gave sensation that he was engrossed.
While Rangers descended to the sixth place, Livingston ascended to the third place, and only behind Hibernian's Hibernian is with a different goal goal.
And it could have been much worse for Rangers after Calum Spence line judge had to be treated by a wound on his head through the presumption of throwing a object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that pulled Ayr in the semifinals of Betfred Cup, Scotland Cup Cup.

Rangers might dominate possession, but Livingston did a lot more when they had ball.
They could have scored in only two minutes when the short pase of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gateway, but the centercampist lost this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot of Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion, Alan Lithgow, only got a crack in the second peace.
Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than they were convinced about their game in the offensive area.
Alfredo Morelos sinta que they would have to pay penalties to 15 minutes when Steven Lawless hit, but arbitrator Steven Thomson, ignored the claims of Colombian.
The Rangers only made two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's old guardian, Liam Kelly, only had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head remate and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While Livingston's opening at 34 minutes could have been going against game logic, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
Rangers lost again when faced the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fixed the ball for Scott Robinson, who maintained cold blood to choose Menga for a simple remate.

But Livingston continued to devour visitors playing exactly the kind of game you like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have expanded the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corener.
Rangers' substitut, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he rushed with Jacobs, but Thomson rushed again.
Almanaque: the inventor of the contador Geiger
And now a page of our almanaque of "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADO... was the day of birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that ultimately led it to the device known as Geiger Counter.
A pear of science since then, the contador Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("The Camps of Coronado"), protagonized by those apparently insolite vaquor scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: "He's a Geiger accounter, who's used to locate radioactive mineraries, like uranium.
When these headphones are posed, the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity of minerals may be heard."
Evans: "Di, I'm sure you're going to go now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.

New Cancer Vaccination Can Teach the Immunosystem to "see" defect cells
New Cancer Vaccine can teach immunosystem to "see" defect cells and defect cells
Vaccine teaches immunosystem how to recognize defect cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and return to injectal
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who is treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immunologic system how to recognize defect cells, has observed that her ovarian ovarian cancer is disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method implies the extraction of immune cells of a patient, which are altered in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine"
HER2 "impulse the growth of various types of cancer", including breast cancers, ovaries, lungas and colorrectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "instructed" to address cancer cells functioned in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West initiated a speech in favor of Trump when using a MAGA chapel (Make America Great Again) trail his appearance in Saturday Night Live program (SNL).
And the result wasn't good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they hit Kanye West in the study after a confused presentation in which he elected US President Donald Trump, and said he would present him as candidate in 2020.
After interpreting the third song of the night, called Ghost Town ("City of ghost"), in which he was taking a bunch of Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterate their support for Trump.
"I often speak with white and say, "How can you like Trump if it's racist?"
"If I was concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL started the program with a satira played by Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the United States Senate Judicial Committee about claims for sexual aggression made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcasted, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West’s criticism to social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to hide from West with this post.
West also complained at audition that he had spent a bad moment at the guarders because of his gourmet.
"Desde, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, demon, de
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm afraid!
"And then they said that I was going to the pike," he said according to Washington Examiner.
"West, we'll see how I'm going to pick it up, we'll see how I'm going to pick it up, we'll see how I'm going to pick it up, we'll see how I'm going to pick it up, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll see, we'll.
Test with love.”
His comments provoked apologies in the audience at least twice, and members of SNL's listing seemed to be ashamed, according to Variety, with the following test that a person who was there gave the publication: "All study remained absolute silent."
West was named as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed with an interpretation of the song I Love it ("I Love it"), dressed like a bottle of water Perrier.
Wet received the support of the CEO of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the most courageous spirits: GRATIS POR FACER FRONTE FRONTE À MAFIA"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying West was simply "be who he is and that's completely amazing".
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
Is free.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "that being officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; follow Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
Independence affects over 880 000 people in the country, so the health authorities.
40.000 new cases have been notified only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vaste majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditional, HIV was rapidly propaged by some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who suffered HIV in this way was practically reduced to zero, according to Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms interannual, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality discriminated in China in 1997, but they affirm that discrimination against LGBT people expanded.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up marrying women.
Many transmissions of the disease proven from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to mediation for HIV as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a personal member filtrate data from senators of Republican Party, "Dangerous falsehoods" and "conspirative teories"
The representative of the US, Maxine Waters, denounced the accusations that a member of his personality had posted personal information by three senators of the American Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Democrat of Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the statements were made by websites and commentators of "ultradereita".
"Linges, lyinges, and more fameless lyinges," commented Waters in a statement on Twitter.
Secondly, the information distributed included particular addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, headquarters of the United States government, during a hearing by Senate panel on accusations of inappropriate sexual conduct against candidate to Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Filtration appeared a little after the three senators were questioned Kavanaugh.

"Ese infundable accusation is totally fals, et totally false," continuo Waters.
"Member of my personal, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, wasn't responsible for any way of filtering this information.
"This injustificable accusation is totally falsified, and totally false."
Waters’ Declaration promptly raised criticism on-line, including criticisms of ex-Press Secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer scriba: "Este menzogne, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci, deci,

If anyone is accused of something that he hasn't done, he mustn't be accused of something that he hasn't done.
You must not be ashamed.
"Don't worry about the accused.
He must remain arrogant and quiet.”
I seemed like Fleischer was comparing Waters reaction with criticism of the Democrats of the Kavanaugh Judge, to the critics accused of seeming too furious during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presents himself to bank Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "entities responsible for compliance with law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
"We'll be sure to discover the innocents," he continued, "although they'll be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and to each member of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), The Spion Parodia Without Power by Rowan Atkinson
It's already traditional to find Brexit transcendence in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can apply to the return of franchise of this parodia and action comedy of Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Ironic satira will be converted to the matter of the apparently stupid thing that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The The
Naturally, it's the secret idiot agent that, in spite of his strikeful pretensions of glamur adulator, has a little Clouseau, a chisco of Mr Bean and a anaco of this type that contributed with a unique note in the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of London 2012.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent Atkinson interpreted once in our now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where it sealed chaos in his step.
There's a few good moments at Johnny English's last release.
I admire when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval arms tray and the steps of the rotor make a short stunning against his cascade.
Atkinson's donation for physical comedy jumps in sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is awesomely superfluous, especially when this kind of "series" movies like 007 and "Mission Impossible", they already use comedy convincingly as one of their ingredients.
It seems like humor was directed to children rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant accidents are not so ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's film skits change when encarnating Bean's character.
Now the topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate pirate infiltered in the network of super-secret web-secret web-spy-secret from Britain and reveal the identity of all British agents in the area, to anxiety of the agent that is in service, a miserable little little role role for Kevin Eldon.
"It is the threak for a Prime Prime Minister pompous and in conflict, which already suffer a total total crisis of total total of political unpopularity: Emma Emma Thompson gives the best of itself with this character with this character that it almost look like Theresa May, but it can not be done a lot with the script but it can not be done with the script.
Your Intelligence Advisors shall inform you that, since all the spies have compromised, you must withdraw someone from the withdrawal.
And that refers to the inkompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as professor in some snob institution, but gives extraofficial lessons about how to become a agent infiltrated; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers spies academia to a rock school.
Take English back to Whitehall for a emergency information session and meet with his old and suffered companion Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in what Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
The Batman and Robin from the errors of the Secret Service of Sua Majesty return to action, joining the beautiful fatale femme of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously subsuming the charm of the charismatic multimillionaire technological who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.

Obviously, all detentions are out of that last sequence, but in the kindness and scandalous way it is, it seems to have been pulled out of a children's TV program.
The result is fairly regular.
And, as happened to other Johnny English films, they couldn't avoid thinking: The British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?

The Congress of Trade Unions supported four days a week as a measure for workers to benefit from changing economy.
A major source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "Hopefully a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from day to night, but a work week of four days is a ambition that adaptes to the approach of the party to balance economics in favor of the worker, as well as to the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such a idea, since the Green Party promised a working week of four days working week during its campaign for general elections 2017.
And yet, in the present day, the labourist party does not support ambition in total.

US could use Marine to make a "blocking" to hinder energy exports from Russia, US Interior Secretary announced
"If it is necessary," Washington can use the marine to prevent russ energy from coming to markets, including that of the Middle East, "described US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment in Syria, particularly where it operates instances of legitimate government, is a pretext of exploration of new energy markets in Syria.
"I think that the reason why they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they've done it in East Europe," he said, according to report.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the forms and means to handle him.
"United States, together with the marine, have the ability to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy doesn't go to market," he said.
Zinke was thus addressed to the participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called itself as the "energy consumer voice voice" in the USA.
He has compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that in practice he treats the same thing.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, in exploiting and replacing fuels," he commented, at the same time referring to Russia, saying that "ha only a tactical" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while Trump’s administration was in a mission to stimulate exports of its gas gas gas liquide to Europe, in order to replace Russia’s, the eco-friendly option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including the President himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the Nord Stream 2 oiled oil duty which, according to Trump, transformed Berlin into "activate" of Moscow.
Moscow recalled repeatedly that the Nord Stream oil oil 2 of $11 billion, which was established to double the capacity of existing oil oil to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is argued only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think that we shared the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, russian minister of energy, in a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The US posture received Germany's reaction, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leader organisation of the sector, the German Federation of Industry German Federation (BDI), urged US to remove US from EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state intercepted in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, president of BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

18 states and District of Columbia defiant new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.

Karl Racine, prosecutor general of Columbia District, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation".

The taxists continued to discuss in the report that the policy that rejects the entrance of immigrants gives the US economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide workmanship".

"The asylum is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to raciality, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular group social or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of politics on 11 June.
Asylum has never been designed to relieve all the problems (inklusive all the serious problems) that people face every day in the world.

Donald Trump, President of the United States, refers to the payment supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper of the state of Iowa, after accusing China of intervening in elections to Congress of the United States, which will take place 6 November, made China negate.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections, marked what officials of that country affirmed Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to co-operate China.
Although it is normal that foreign governments publicate ads for promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war test of leveling pornographics in their respective imports.
According to China and US experts, China’s compensatory arances at the beginning of trade war were designed to damage exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China, and exgobernator of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products in China, said Beijing has damaged labourers, farmers and American businessmen.
In an article of opinion written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of Moines Register, China exposes that "China is intensifying that campaign of assault by spreading propaganda ads in the American free press".
"Under spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press when publishing an announcement of payment in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the post of newspapers situated at the end of this Beijing street, there are few voices disidentes, and there is no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about the alarming economic trajectory of China, since the media are under the firm polar of the Chinese Communist Party."
In the same way, he states that "one of China's most important newspapers rejected the offer of publishing" its article, though it did not confirm that it was a newspaper.
Kavanaugh’s Katastrophe Lost Women’s Republican Vote in a few Days of Half Mandate Elections

Reasons around these accusations were numerous, and the majority of Republicans were positioned to continue to vote.
"These things can't be cut off," said Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also argued that doubting that the last hour of senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm down the animoses of angry voters.
"Females won't forget what happened yesterday, as well as they won't forget it in a future nearly or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, principal advisor and national spokesman of the MoveOn progressivist group, in Washington, D.C.
Friday morning, opponents, the grip of "Acércase November!" manifested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment, in spite of the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, informed Mic.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of Democrats will supere any expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, neutral analist politics.
"It's sure that it's already high,
But it is still more important, particularly among women who voted uncertainly in the outer districts or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, that although they don't like President, they usually don't go to urnes."
Prior to Ford's public witness detailed his accusations of sexual aggression against candidates of Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if Republicans continued before confirmation.
"This has become a catastrophe for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, ex-president of the National Committee Republican Republican, at the beginning of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes less than the vote of the committee, of the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how Republicans handled this and how they handled it," noted Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, group helping the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are split between believe Ford's witness or Kavanaugh's witness, although they tend to support this latter more.
YouGov’s new survey shows that 41 % of the surveyed believes totally or possibly Ford’s testimonie, compared to 35 % supporting Kavanaugh’s testimonie.
In addition, 38% believes that the most likely is Kavanaugh is lying during his testimony, compared to 30% who thinks the same as Ford.
Due to Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations submitted by Ford, as well as those at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified to Senate Judiciary Committee last week at the Senate Judiciary Committee under a vow that Kavanaugh attacked Kavanaugh in a state of abuse when he was 17 years old.
In contrast, Ramirez argued that the candidate to Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a college party when this studied in Yale in the 80s.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this legend of technology, is a solid company based, Berners-Lee open source platform.

In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee happily said that the intention that Inrupt echoed is "dominating the world".
"We have to do," he said about startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data online" or POD.
You may include lists of contacts, lists of pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser simultaneamente.
All this makes this storage of personal data unique is that the user has complete control over who can access this information.
The Company qualifies this as a "personal transfer through data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to his President John Bruce, is that the company provides the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to all the world.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company ownership of IBM, some developers employed to work on the project and a community of voluntary programers.
From this week, developers from all over the world would be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt website.

In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed Internet, establishing World Wide Web Consortium Community at the Institute of Technology of Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has erected as a influential voice in debatt about network neutrality.
Berners-Lee continues to be founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

Homenaxe Bernard Vann, clero condecorate with the Cross of Victoria in the First World War
The only clergy of England Church who was condecored with the Victoria Cross during the First World War received a posthum homenax in his native city 100 years after.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded 29 September 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was assassinated by a brigade four days later, without knowing that he was authorized to be the largest British military condecoration.
Saturday, his two nephews were responsible for discovering a commemorative monument in his honor in a desfile in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his nephews, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the farming of his grandfather who deserved his title.
According to the London Gazette publication, 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann addressed his batallón by Saint-Quentin Canal "amid a dense and underneath the jugo of a intense fire of metropolitans".
Later, later, soon soon soon soon soon soon soon to get to the line of fire and, with "grande courage", with "grande courage", directed line line front front front front front, before se climb face face face before se climb with cannon, un cannon, unless helpless with cannon, unless helpless, without anybody, and kick three men, three men, three men, and three men, enemi.
Lieutenant Vann was assassinated by a German francotirador 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72-year-old, claimed that his grandmother's actions are "a thing he could never live, but a lesson still like this."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the show, which headed the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said to feel "I am honored to participate in the show" and adds that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig sets roll to MMA fans in the best moment
Imagine that you take smart all night to enjoy Bellator 206, full show, and when the best part arrives something that stops you.
San Jose's cartel included 13 combats, which were six main, and was retransmitted live in UK on Channel 5.
But the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see faces, British viewers stayed perplexed when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some of them didn't surprise them after spending so many hours smart waiting to see the fight.
A fan described or changed these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad gusto".
"The state legislation reges that that content wasn't suitable for 6:00 am tomorrow, and therefore it was necessary to change the programation of children," explained Dave Schwartz, Vicepresident Senior Marketing and Communications Bellator, when asked him for retransmission.
"Papa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, claimed that they would consider UK viewers in future programming.
"I think we'll be soluble when we think about the repetition," said Coker.
" " " ", " " " " " ", 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor, all, No No No No No No No No No No No No No Un Un Un Un Un Un Un Un Un,,,,, ", " ", " ", " " " " ", " " " " " " " " 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 Mor, all all all all all all,,
But we are working to find a solution.
I started to receive many messages, and all of them were glad.
We were trying to solve because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a problem of governance.
I promised that it won't happen again.
We will limit the five fights instead of six. We will give the best to our favorites, but we will limit the five fights, and we will be among them.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel Less Because His Sexuality
Tom Daley, olimpic jumper, says that he has grown feeling inferior to all the world because of his sexuality, but this showed him to find motivation to win.
This 24 year old athlete says that he didn't realize that all the world was like the one who came to school.
Guest of the first broadcast of the program Desert Island Discs Radio 4 led by Lauren Laverne, explained that he started talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact of being father helped him to relativise the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presentator of this program, is low by disease.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was not socially acceptable that they like the kids and girls."
"Today, that sensation of inferiority and degradation and being different is that which inspired me and gave me the force needed to achieve success."
I wanted to show that I was "somebody" so that people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Australian Commonwealth Games to ask more countries to deplete homosexuality.
Ella decidió hablar porque sentía la oportunidad de vivir abiertamente, sin temerosas consecuciones, y quería dar esperanza a otros.
The three times world champion said to fall in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, who he knew in 2013, "I was a whole surprise."
Daley matrimonialized with this Oscar winner last year and said that 20 years of difference between them never was a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (with only 14 years old you first participated in the Olympic Games for the first time and your father died of cancer three years later), it's difficult to find someone in your age who experienced similar elevations.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change his perspective.
"If you ask me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal."
"Mas now, I know there are things much more important than a gold medal.
"For me, my medal is Robbie."
Her son, Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40, due to cancer of brain.
Daley's father didn't accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked his son were one tickets to London 2012, he wanted to be first line.
"I can't tell him that I wouldn't be here to occupe that first line," said Daley.
"I stod her hand when she stopped breathing and was at that moment, at the moment of her death, when I realized that it really wasn't invincible."
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze medal.
"In this moment you know that that was the dream of my life: jumping against a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling."
The choice of the song Proud de Heather Small is also not in van, because it's the melody that accompanied him during preparing for Olympics, and still putting his hair on top.

A low-shaped Mickelson ended in Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match of Ryder Cup, but he must improve his technique so that this won't become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the 12th yearly event, stayed in bank by the decision of Captain Jim Furyk and couldn't participate in fourballs or foursomes Saturday Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many times to America, the champion five times spent day animating and working to improve his movements.
Although it has never been the most precise of the players, and it's not so long at the moment of love of his career, at 48 years old he doesn't fit in the landscaped Le Golf National, where high grass usually punishes the wrong shooting.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson confronted on Sunday's ninth match with precise Francesco Molinari, British Open winners, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If Americans, four points below the beginning of the 12 individual matches, start with good foot, Mickelson's action could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, though he couldn't say much more.
"I understand perfectly the role I played today, I gave a palmado on my shoulder, I pause my arm and I said that tomorrow I'll be ready," shared Furyk.
"Eh konfidenciante fullt ut.
He has a prominent place in Fama Salon and has contributed a lot to teams last and this week.
I probably didn't think to play two matches.
I thought that I would play more, but at the end, that's how things are, and that's how we thought they should be.
Som all folk, jeg ønsker å være der ute."
Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo record in the largest number of matches played in Ryder Cup.
You could mark the end of your career at Ryder Cup, a career that never reached your individual palmares level.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 halfs, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to teams.
"He's a funny person, sarcastic, with understanding and likes to sit with people, he's a good guy to have in the team," she explained.
"Jeg liker å se hur bra det går med de yngste spillerne denne uken.

The European Captain Thomas Bjorn, fears of the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, European Captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of individuals of Ryder Cup can easily become a troubled journey.
The Grand Dance debuted in 1997 in a match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they finally reached the target line with minimal advantage win 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 .
"You continue thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just as in Brookline, where we lost, where we lost, but in Valderrama we win for a little," Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 Fridays and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Historia shows that this is still not finished.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You have to go out and do what is right.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trofee, and we must focus on it.
"I'm not tired of saying that, I'm concentrated on our 12 players who are on our side, but I'm also very aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Inspired by the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn said: "I would never sing victory before time.
"Somafore, we'll meet another animal.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and there is also to demonstrate our value.
It's great to be with a companion when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try it best your ability to golfer.
"That's the message you need to tell gamers to know the best of yourself tomorrow.

In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than with his companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who summed three points four.
Furyk himself was in two ends of these rounds of the last day, part of Brookline winners team, but endlessly as a loser of the European miracle trail in Medinah."
"I remember each of the fucked words," replied, "when asked him how Ben Crenshaw, kapitan in 1999, would meet the players face to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the impulse goes in a direction, there's a lot of pressure in intermediary matches.
"We're preparing our alignment, having this in mind, and putting the players as it seemed to us, we want to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the rest of Europe, in the top half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his choice for individuals.
Germany's new warship is posted again
The newest fregata of the German Navy of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014 in 2014, to replace old warships of the era of the Cold War War, but it will not arrive at least next year due to defectuous systems and defectuous systems and the cost of increasingly increasing, according to local media.
The post in service of "Rheinland-Pfalz", leader of the flamenca fragata fragrant vessel Baden-Wuerttemberg klase Baden-Wuerttemberg, was a goodbye until the first semestre of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
Navy should have been incorporated to Marine in 2014, but the subsequent problems of delivery impacted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships, which the Navy encompassed in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class fragatas.
It will be understood that they will have a powerful canon, with different anti-asteroid missiles and anti-boat missiles, as well as with the technology of dissipation, such as a low radar, infrared, and acoustic signs.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to overthrow the newer fragments up to two years outside the original ports.
However, according to Die Zeit, these continual delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that they will allow Germany to project its power in the foreigner, will be antiquated when they enter service.
The unfortunate fragata F125 was reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned to Blohm & Voss estate in Hamburg.

The defects of software were particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 navals 120; i.e. half of the crew needed in the former Bremen class fragests of Bremen class.
Independently, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess of weight, which reduces its performance and limits the capability of the Navy to gain betters in the future.
Think that Rheinland-Pfalz 7000 ton weighs twice the same class boats used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defect hardware, the total price of the project, which includes the formation of crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is confirmed that it already reaches the incredible amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the initial 2200 million euros.
Problematik sneakers of the newest fragatas give special importance in light of recent warnings that German navy power is making waters.
Initially this year Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of Defence Committee of German Parliament, admitted that Navy is staying without vessels capables of disrupting.
The officer replied that this problem is increasing, because the old ships were removed, but they were not replaced by others.

National Trust Spionage of the Secret Life of the Musicians
A new research that is being carried out in a finca of Highlands in Scotland sets out how pests use the landscape to find food.
Hopefully, the results will shine light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland Association will follow Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording teams will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pieces during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of the sound carried out by experts from all records will determine the frequency of calls of the pieces and that each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be developed to create a detailed image in size of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important for the fragments and how each species uses.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitat work, such as the creation of landscapes and which is the best way to preserve forests for fragments and other species associated with them.
The population of fragments in Scotland and throughout UK declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and loss of habitat.
The aerogenerators and the alumeado also represent a risk, as well as the traps with adhesion to mosquito, some chemical treatments of building materials and attacks of cats domestic.

They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight pathway.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the pieces very seriously.
We have 10 trained experts who conduct periodically surveys, child inspections and occasionally even rescues.
La organización cuenta even with the unique and first reserve of Scottish fragments in Threave Estate Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the 10 species of Scottish fragments.
David Thompson, manager of State, says that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave, we have a great area for pests," he said.
"We counted with old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
"But there's a lot of things that we still don't know about the pieces, so the work we're doing here and other properties can help us to understand better what they need to prosper."
It underscores the importance of controlling the presence of fragments before carrying out maintenance tasks in the property, since it is possible that involuntary destruction of a single child maternity could kill up to 400 females and infants, which could destroy a whole local population.
Pigs are a species protected, and it is illegal to kill them, to kill them, or to irritate them, as well as to destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"Maybe there's plenty to learn about the pieces, and in case of many species, we're not sure how it goes to their populations."
Ronaldo renunciar demands for violation and his advocates prepare to appeal to German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calificate accusations of violation against him as false, arguing that the only thing people want him is to know himself using his name.
The prosecutors will investigate the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these accusations.
Portugal's and Juventus' fronts were accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, a US woman, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is believed that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 so that she shouldn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel posted Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33, tagged this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
"No, no, no, no 1000 times.
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"People want to know themselves using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be glorious because they only say my name, it's part of my work.
They're a happy and respectable man," said a player smiling.
Ronaldo's advocates prepare to appeal Der Spiegel for accusations, which qualify as "unacceptable declaration of suspicions in privacy area" according to Reuters.
Advocat Christian Schertz, who said that the player would request compensation for "moral damage moral for an amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious breach of personal rights in recent years".
The suspected incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite of Palm Hotel and Casino de Las Vegas.
After they met themselves in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the room of the player, where they supposedly violated it anally, according to the documents presented in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga affirme, Ronaldo, after the suspected incident, said he was 99 % horseman, but that one percent would betray him.
The documents affirm that Ronaldo confirms that both of them maintained sexual relations consented by both parties.
Mayorga also argues that she went to police and counted photographs of the wounds, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified by represalies and was concerned about public scare.
34-year-old woman says she wants to revoke the deal while she continues traumatized by the suspected incident.
In the time of the presumptuous crime, Ronaldo was about to meet Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer joined the Italian gigantic Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automakers would abandon UK
The United Kingdom would regret the loss of its position as world leader of automaking cars by Brexit, according to Greg Clark Business Secretary.
Toyota UK said that it is worrying that Toyota UK said at BBC that Britain would leave EU without a deal, it would temporarily suspend production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It's necessary to get a deal," he added.
The manufacturer of autos japoneses argued that, in the case of Brexit not reaching any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost workplaces.
Burnaston's plant, managed for production of Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, producer lanely ca. 150.000 vehicles, cucumbers exported 90 % for rest of EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain abandone the EU in late March, we will be witnesses to how the production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers also expressed their fear of abandoning the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of automakers is the risk of supply chain in case we do not reach an agreement in Brexit.
Toyota's production line is very customized, every 37 minutes come parts from UK and EU suppliers for automaking customized.
If UK abandoned EU on 29 March, without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and could resulted in delays and deficiency of fish.
Company says that it would be impossible that Toyota maintained normal ritm over a day in Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark argued that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with EU is "accurately kalibrated to prevent such controls at the border."
"It's important to have a deal. And we want it's the best deal, so that you can enjoy the current success, but also enjoy this opportunity," aldus BBC Radio 4.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chain."
Toyota couldn't estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long-term costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could even cost workplaces.
Peter Tsouvallaris, employee of Burnaston for 24 years, and coordinator sindical of Unite, said that his members are cada vez more concerned: "Per experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
One spokesman of the Government said they presented a precise and cribable plan for future relations between UK and EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could go again
The White House argued that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the vice-secretary of Justice Rosenstein could delay a week later due to the struggle for candidate candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, links between Russian assistants and Trump, and possible obstacle to justice by President's side of justice.
Whether Trump releases the adjunct prosecutor general, or whether he does not, which threatened the independence of Mueller, it feeded the rumors in Washington for months.
Initially this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of destituting President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected report.
Ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically, ironically.
But a meeting with Trump, who was in New York, announced Thursday.
Trump claimed that I would rather not have to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to prevent a shock with the audience of Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual behavior.
Trump ordered Friday a week investigation to FBI about complaints against Kavanaugh, which delayed voting in Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretariat, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
During the question about meeting with Rosenstein, he responded: "Maybe there's no date fixed, it might be this week, or it might be another week, given all that's going on in Supreme Court.
"We'll see, but you know that I like the press to be informed."
Several journalists questioned this statement, since Sanders took it since 10 September without celebrating a role of prensa.
"When Chris Wallace, delegator, interrogee: "Oh, delegator, delegator, delegator, delegator, delegator, delegator, delegator, delegator
San San San San Sander Sanders said said said said said said that the lack San San Sanders said said that that the lack San Sanders said that the lack San San Sanders said that the lack San San Sanders said said that the lack San San San Sanders said that the lack San San San San San Sanders said said that that not not not was not was not was not was was not was was was not was was was was not was was was was not in in in in the the the not not not not, the the the the the the the the, the the the the the the the the, the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the, report report report report report report report,,,,,,,
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"President gives more interviews than pre-President," he affirmed, though he not cited source that evaluated these data.
"They will continue to take part in information meetings," said Sanders, "but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly the president of the United States, that's much better to ask her questions.
"You're witnesses of how we've been doing this in the past few weeks, and that'll replace a press roll in which you can talk directly to President of the United States."
Trump often responds to questions when he leaves White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignity visitors.
However, the press conferences in loneliness are low.
"Maybe the president demonstrated the reason for this week in New York, with free appearance and occasionally strange before journalists meeting meetings.

And for this, it is necessary to swallow the disastrous market of the living.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and start a life here.

Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said his "final ambition" consists of becoming Scotland's selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotland is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwest club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from head.
He reached Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to Premiership in Scotland last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that's all that," Ross told the BBC Scottish Sportsound program.
"I've grown up watching Scotland play in Hampden often with my father when I was a child, something that they always wanted to live back.
"Maybe i'll be successful only if i'll be successful in a club."
Entre Ross's predecessors de Sunderland, including Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic affirme that he has not felt anxiety about the success of these figures so consolidated in such a great club after rejecting pre-propositions of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Maybe I'm going to return this club to Premier League?"
Because the structure and installations of the club definitivly belong to a club of Premier League", he said.
"Not going to be a simple job to come here, but it's possible you just think I've succeeded here if I can return the club to Premier."
Ross takes only three years as coach after a Dumbarton assistant period and 15 months within Hearts technical staff.
In that period, Alloa helped Alloa to recover from the descendance to the third division and succeeded in St Mirren to pass from being the tops of descending to win Champions Championship title for the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever found during his gamer career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I'm probably found me in a royal crossover," memoirt, in order to take charge of Alloa.
"I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than to play.
It sounds rar because it wasn't bad to me, I reasonably gained my life well and enjoyed some successes.
But play can be difficult.
There are many things you need to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer in the stress and pressure of work, but I like to train.
I’ve always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 17:30 a.m.
The hot wave of summer increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but it put more pressure on restaurants chains.
The pubs and bars experienced an increase of 2,7 per cent during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4,8 per cent according to the numbers.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA Commercial Advisory Board of CGA, responsible for compiling the figures, said: "The sunny days and England's persistence in the world of football over the longest of the expected resulted in July to demonstrate a pattern similar to June month, where pubs enjoyed an increase of 2,8 per cent higher pubs.
The decline of 1,8 per cent in the volume of the business of the restaurants during June aggravated during July.
Pubs and bars specialized in drinking were the best results gained with increases in consumption above reductions experienced by restaurants.
Pubs specialized in lunch also suffered sun, though not so dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out to drink.
In pubs and bars controlled, consumption of beverages increased by 6,6 per cent during the month, and foods decreased by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, employee of RSM company for the analysis of activities of recreation and hospitality, said: "These results represent a continuation of trend that comes from end April.
Time and impact of major social and sport events continues to be the major factors in the consumption outside the house.
It's not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, falling 4,8 per cent annual will resulte particularly painful if the cost continues to increase.
"The hot and long summer has not been able to have come in a worse moment for restoration business and time will be responsible for saying whether moderation of temperatures experienced during August will give the necessary breathing for sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 per cent during July, which reflects a slowdown in brand launches.

1 out of 5 children have accounts of secret social networks that hide to their parents
One out of five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social network accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Insta"
This news provoked a greater fear of being posted content sexually
20% of the students said they had a "principal account" to show their parents.
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating accounts on social media that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students demonstrated an increase in the number of accounts of "Insta False" (referred to the social network of Instagram photo exchange).
This news resulted in abundance of fear for sexual contents.
Twenty percent of students said they used a "principal" account softened to show their parents while they had other privates.
A mother who met with the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teen who asked her to "violation".
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-old boys and girls had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, HMC's manager, said: "It's alarmant that there are so many adolescents tentated to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."

Hundreds of infants migrated silently to a camp in Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased although the monthly number of crosses from the border remained relatively invariable, partly due to rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump administration were difficult to allocate patterns for children.
Traditionally, majority of the patrons were also migrants without papers and feared to put their ability to stay in the country in danger of putting them in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announcing that possible paternities and other adult members of their household would have to send their digital grabs and that those data would be shared with immigration authorities.

The longer they remain under custody, the less likely they become anxiety or depresive, which may cause violent retreats or attempts to escape according to refugee workers and system reports published in recent months.
The attorneys claimed that these fears increase in centres of larger dimensions like Tornillo, where there is more probability that symptoms that a child is going through badly go unnoticed due to their size.
They also invited children to displace the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from emotional point of view or to relax from friends could assume a trauma that many continue to suffer.

Moualem, on the theme of the refugees, declared that they were given the right conditions for their return and blasphemed "some Western countries" for "distribution of irracional fears" which resulted in the repatriation of the refugees.

However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "datos clear limits" and expressed his hope that militare actions are destined by jihadists, including Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, which "we will be "erradicated".
The UN Staffan de Mistura (UN Staffan de Mistura) has hoped to organize the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and of the opposition to elaborate a set of post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the celebration of elections.
Moualem exposed the conditions for the guarantee of the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, arguant, that the work of the agency should be restricted to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interferences.

Then the governors ordered the seven men to be brought into the hospital.
The airline told that six passengers stayed in the hospital on the Sabbath day, and that all the passengers were sitting steady.
Cause of accident and exact sequence of events continues without being clear.
The airline and the US Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the lake before arriving on the landings track.
Some of the witnesses testify that avions spanded langs de landing track.

Analyst komponent cronologic nocturne, in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor was remitted to tests Saturday in repetition of the sentence of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi living in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analytiker of the United States Department of Justice, testified for hours as a witness expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, the jury described how he used the records of a mobile phone to reconstitute the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, in the night of his death.

When these data proved that your cell phone was found with Chambers during the time he said he was with your friend Michael Sanford, the police went to chat with Sanford.
And it came to pass on the sabbath day, when he had taught them, that the day was not found in the city.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis argued that he knew Chambers since about 2 weeks ago when he died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they knew only for a week ago.
Rowlett stated that a time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his phone.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is going on in the way FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could obtain something like what I asked (a investigation for a time limited and a limited range), it would be possible that we could obtain a little unity", he commented Mr Flake Saturday, insisting that he feared that the committee would be "destroyed" due to paralysis of partisans.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his sympathizers Republicans want FBI to investigate?
Its reprobation is due to a question of deadlines.

The number of desertors in North Korea is low under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean desertors destined to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Jong Un access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korean Ministry of Unification, claimed that 1.127 dessertions will occur during last year, far from 2,706 from 2011.
Mr. Park affirmed that the endurance of the border controls between North Korea and China and the increase of tariffs charged by people responsible for transferring people to the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make public comments.
To the vast majority of North Deserts offreceselles ultimately offere citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of Korean war in 1953.
The majoritarian foxen across China, which has the largest three-third border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the strongly protected desmilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China consider deserters as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them obligatoryly.

This same month, leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to maintain conversations focused on negotiations about elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic meeting of June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, where they agreed a large way of working to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, accused the Sanctions imposed by the United States of America of the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and, under these circumstances, there's no possibility that we'll disarma ourselves unilaterally first", he said in a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and says that it's not fit to access Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, leader of minority in Chamber of Commerce, called candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "histeric" and assured that it was inadequate by its nature to access Supreme Court.
Pelosi conducted these comments in an interview held Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"They couldn't avoid thinking that if a woman ever acted like that way, wouldn't call her histerical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected emotionally the accusations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was adolescent.
During the initial declaration, Kavanaugh proved very excited, occasionally laughing and staying talking while describing his family and his school years.
He also expressly condemned the democrats of the committee, cataloging the accusations against him as a "great and coordinated reputation assassination" organized by liberals angry by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the presidency elections of 2016.
Pelosi claimed that he thought Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he couldn't access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had damages against the democrats.
"I think it's disqualificable with these statements and how he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he was asked if he would try to conteste Kavanaugh if he was confirmed on the spot and if the demokrats were gained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is the following: if you're not saying the truth to Congress or FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in Supreme Court, but in court court where it's currently located," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently judge of the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi argued that, as a democrata, she was concerned about the possible resolutions she could adopte Kavanaugh against the law of protection of patient and health care accessible or the Roe case against Wade, since it was considered a conservative judge.
In view of confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about whether it would cancel certain decisions of Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a hysterical person and histerikal person, with prejudice, to go to court, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all the time, and all time!"

Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressist of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidencial candidatures.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was hit in an adventure outside of marriage in a ship named Monkey Business and was removed from the presidency career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of presenting her to the presidency.
"It wasn't a good thought decision," he commented in laughter 30 years later.
"There were 7 candidates in their career, and the last one needed another.
Some people call them "Brancaneves and the Seven Ananos".
Because the campaign was advanced, it was delayed in recalling funds, so he promised that he would not enter the Presidency career until he could recalling $2 million.
It was a battle lost.
You found that some of you supporting you gave $1,000 to the male candidates would only give you $250.
"What do you think I have a dismission?", he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions (from gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult to collect money and address to voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) which remained without words.
"You would think that you would suffer a nervous crisis," remembered Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted with her.
"You thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
Memoria: "What do you write in my paper?"
"Chorou?"
How can the trade war between the USA and China to Beijing be positive?
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were sharp and, although the war is far from end, a distance between countries can be beneficial for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, lanced the first warning in early this year recording Chinese key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was produced this week with the application of new tariffs that affect an equivalent to $200,000 billion, recording half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has contracted the same attack each time, the most recent up tariffs from 5 to 10 per cent to 60,000 billion dollars in US products.
China promised to imitate US measures, and it seems unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will change in short term.
In order to make Washington retreat back, it would be necessary to cede before his claims, but duplicating publicly before the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, President China.
Yet, the experts argued that Beijing knows to play their letters correctly, the pressure of trade war with USA could favorize China in long-term while reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start a economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, Asia Center for New American Security, a research center.

Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the American team by a final marker from 16,5 to 10,5 in the Le Golf National club located in Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in Europe and leads without winning Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europa recovered the crown when the team of the danesic captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14,5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was the best battle offered during the tournament, ordered the ballo to water in the 16 hole of par 3 and lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfist has brilled in all his series, becoming one of the only four players who gained 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament implanted in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst ranking of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may play his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups contested, the Spanish Sergio García converted to European player with the most victorious of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
"I am not often crying, but today I can't avoid it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and trusting in me.
I am so happy and so happy to recover the cup.
"The important thing is team, and I am glad to be able to help," said an excited García after European victories.
He passed witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf by 2&1 in individual match Sunday.
"It's incredible that I feel proud today to have been able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing that boy playing," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winners, situated just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had troubles throughout the weekend so as not to leave the streets, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-kalibre golf during the whole tournament.
Jim Furyk, Captain of the United States, claimed after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these guys, they were fighting.
"Normalt, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence, hence,
Loitamus.
I'm the sweatman before Thomas.
He's a good captain.
Fifty of the 12 players boss.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go further.
I want to be the 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
I'm going to take off the hat.
They were superiors."
