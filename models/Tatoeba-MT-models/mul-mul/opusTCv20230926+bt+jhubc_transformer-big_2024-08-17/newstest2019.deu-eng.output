DFB Chief Grindel does not see any basis for Özil Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently considers no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
“This is, of course, a question that depends on the fact that once you’re in conversation, you’re also talking to him about why he seemed to have felt it as in his statement,” Grindel said in the football podcast “Phrasenmächer” of the picture schedule.
Despite the recent debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
“I would have had Mesut Özil played for Germany.
I’ve also thought it would be that way,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified that Grindel did not defend him against racist allegations during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism at Özil that he is not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He doesn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it out of football so that “if you leave a team or change a group, you’re talking about it with his coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t come to an end.”
Linz: Garden house in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 p.m., the professional firefighter Linz was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhof road.
Because a high-voltage pipe leads directly over the screber species settlement, danger was delayed.
The professional firearms came out and found the tent in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically removed from the gasoline and firearms to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden house, he had infected a battery for the store at lunchtime.
This could be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to firefighters, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined, as well as the cause of the fire.
However, he must be significant, because the owner had many collection pieces in his garden hut.
Angry mother returns: Lindsay Lohan arrests refugee family on the open street
What did Lindsay Lohan just drive to this extremely strange action?
She seemed to want an alleged refugee family to enter the children.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has streamed live as she seems to want to enter a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal "TMZ" and published a partial medium of the stream.
Here you can see "For Lucky Kiss" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, it is seen how Lohan goes out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to come out of Syria as a refugee family.
When the family flees right in front of the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It encourages adults to trade children.
For all of this, it does not provide any evidence in the clip.
“The whole world sees that right now,” is Lohan hearing in the video as she continues to pursue the family along the street.
She obviously tries to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it appears to be enough for the obvious angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan misses an ear.
Under tears, the actress looks at how shocking she is – and she holds her wagon.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The sonde "Hayabusa2" launched in December 2014 in Japan.
It is designed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The landlord "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: Number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are spoken.
The number of victims may continue to increase.
The rescue crews have not yet gone into the devastated and cut-off areas from the outside world.
Elon Musk returns as Tesla Supervisor
At the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk took care of anxiety at the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car builder.
The U.S. Board of Directors accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla Chief withdraws from the supervisory board, but he may remain the Chairman of the Board.
The British Conservatives' Party
Scarf preserved - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power fight.
On the party’s agenda, it’s about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference of the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, on front former foreign minister Boris Johnson, is overvalued.
Referendum for a new national name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have argued about these names for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia will call Northern Macedonia in the future and will agree on this Sunday - is it okay?
Protests in Brazil against the right-populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Not") means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood was split in the country.
Thousands went into the streets in several cities to protest against the right-populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" stands as an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the front of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the left working party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," Development Director Peter Mertens told the industry magazine "Automotive Week".
The detained and approved Audi Chief Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the Taskforce will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/drive combinations were expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said: “In early July, we have reached an important step-by-step goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi mother Volkswagen.
Mertens emphasized that the car builder had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had delayed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and would continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities are suggesting to the Audi Chief to have authorized the sale of diesel vehicles with false emission values, according to reports of emissions fraud.
He knew about the manipulations or ignored them consciously.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot is heading the company as Commissioner CEO.
Due to the shift to the new exhaust and consumption testing standard WLTP, production falls at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a declining demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
Shot puts on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel seeks to re-election - Lahm to be in DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel will, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil affairs, re-nomine for the office as President of the DFB next year.
"I do my job and try to make them as good as it goes," Grindel said as a guest in the early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Actual Sports Studio".
You have to try to re-election again and I will do that.
And then you need to see if the support is there too.
According to his own words, the alliance’s leader found it “remarkable,” if he didn’t want to cooperate on the future project after the 2024 summit.
Grindel has been head of allies since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has fallen through the summer march affairs.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for the first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held on DFB Federation Friday, September 27, 2019.
The future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to cooperate at the DFB presidium according to Grindel.
"I would be delighted if my colleagues in the presidency agree that in this role he is also in the presidency with advice in the future and then, of course, willingly invite him to provide his experience in sports issues," Grindel said.
In speculations of whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without migration background should become DFB integration ambassadors in the future.
Currently this office is exerted by the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"When a non-immigration background clearly affects society and football, saying, 'the issue is important, then we have to take care of', it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the grounds where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Right weight loss with half-class weight
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat portion.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the will.
He doesn’t say anything about whether I have replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Federation League.
Against Science City Jena, the wizard won 112:55 (52:31) and offered over 40 minutes a convincing match.
New access Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scorers of the dominant Berliners.
The Ludwigsburg national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an attractive performance before 9113 spectators at his compulsory game debut.
Ex-master Brose Bamberg won at the compulsory debut of Trainer Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best Werfer with the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg-Professor Gabriel Olaseni arrived on 14 counts.
The last year’s playoff half-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt to 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was with 24 points the safest shooter at the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new game with a clear success.
There was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings overcame the Oldenburgers with 25 counts.
The brown swinger, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, has disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 drive of the basket quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens the mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens – no matter where they live.
"We will not allow sympathetics of the PKK or Gülen movement to shatter our citizens and to harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city center of Cologne was partially shut down.
Thousands of police officers were in use, including sharp fires.
The Islamic Federation Ditib is critical because it is considered a prolonged arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Horrorkunde
Musicians like Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes, and Cardi B have thrown out a joint concert at the New York Central Park for more commitment to fighting poverty and disease.
“I want you to go wherever you can,” Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night about 60,0000 viewers before.
Thank you for coming here, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and gold microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm dirty, but it's okay because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actresses like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and assistance organizations also showed themselves at the multi-hour speculation on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a scary second when many viewers held the noise of a roaring metal shutdown for fires, dreaded fear and tried to escape.
Shortly there was panic, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators have been injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed the people out of the scene.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available on the Internet for free every year.
Anyone who wanted to find out had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors, the audience had Jubel and applause - buhphones for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He talked with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had pronounced himself in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court and thus hit many women in front of the head.
At least three women have raised abuse prosecutions until the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects this.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the charges after two women who had experienced sexual assaults, according to their own intelligence, faced him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also meet at any time in an elevator with me," Flake told the audience at the New York concert.
Press Freedom: The Federal Government Defends Journalist's Refugees
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
At the Chancellor Ramt, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt wasn't the problem, said Seibert on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the expiry of the press conference.
The act of the journalist has caused a severe anxiety, which is not acceptable.
He has therefore caused personal protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
There are many journalists in jail in Turkey.
Many of them are opposed to alleged spies or support or membership in prohibited parties or Fethullah Gilles movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the missing attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists have threatened decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: only early September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Later, the cases of the prisoner journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
They came free and were able to return to Germany, but in Turkey there were still trials against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz fully drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by NDR is known for the moisturizing conversations at the theke of the Hamburg Portkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderatorin Ina Müller faces with her guests some beer, some wines or even higher percentage beverages to attract mood and tongue.
A few promises are also bold for the compulsory singing arrangements.
Another result of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: Actress Florian David Fitz known for films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Happiest Day".
The Municher did not get the trip to the high north.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely broken on it, his eyes are only two small shots.
The bed selfie shows a full-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just a powerful cat.
Addressed to his fans, he posted some - probably not quite seriously - findings he now won: "Regulation one: NIE go to Inas Night.
Rule 2: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liquor that smells Ina at half three, also leave away.
The alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the necessities.
They are made of instant breastplates, fish breastplates or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller has survived the nightly surge, it is not known so far.
Since she has moderated the TV entertainment at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to have been clearly tested...
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and misconduct
The 36-kilometer long railroad in the Red Cape Country in Treysa presents difficult to find and sweat.
Recipes against fatiguing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly different.
Screw, cigarette cups, dirt and unrat, demolished dirt and now demonted reference pictures - so it has been introduced since the long entry with a seat group to the bike road on the haas helmet in Treysa.
There is more than an unfamiliar view for the preview object Bahnradweg in the Red Kapchenland.
The theme is occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also by others for a long time, according to the bicycle service officer of the city Ulrich deserthagen.
The problem has already been discussed in the cycling board.
So far there is no solution.
The proposals range from the displacement of the seat group to regular discharge of the waste tanks and cleaning the surfaces at the entrance point.
“I think the last would be the offer of the hour – regardless of any further activities,” Desert Hagen says.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the waste drives cyclists and residents around - the seat group is regular meeting point to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only commonly reported, the ladders are also destroyed: puffs removed from the ground, demolished millers, scratches reversed, sitting furniture damaged.
Volunteers have already been more frequent, told ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the vocabulary drops on the hot stone.
They’re upset that the road on the bike road in Treysa is a meeting point for the swap.
"Long the entire bike road, the Haasse-Hügel is clearly the focus here," confirms the bike traffic officer, who is now also taking care of the new bike site in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: “This may make the threshold far higher to reach community.
However, it would require that a police strike be passed in time.
In principle, desert haeves desire the development of the hae-help.
They have to be more attractive.
The frequency of the bike road can be very satisfied so far.
Tourism marketing is still extensive.
Our bike road is very high quality compared to others in Germany,” the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical risk site, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Ascherea street in Treysa.
There is no trace on the haases.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older ones and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Train Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup", is the call of the city's teiloffensive Hiltrup, in the "Music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with instant twins in the sympathetic Hiltrupper Family", as Karl Franke formuled.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honourable officials of the cultural station.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup live Albachtner, the nine of the "Hilptruper Star Colors", three generations of the families Trenkamp and Rimmer, and the ensemble of the Weseries.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a new one.
We haven’t experienced this in other areas of the city yet.
What did the texts get connected to?
In the locations, the Hilder Lake and the market hall were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig cut the Allee in his striking song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short Umba pause with short interviews with the interpreters or instructions to create them.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also taught guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwig-Hafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
Alvin Jasic, however, has been posted on Youtube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hilduper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the favourites of the jury - so that others can also hear their songs.
A full CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Immergig with his Hiltrup Schlager, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very nice performance" with ten children and two educators of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again – and even without electronic support complained “very well,” as Franke said.
The jury was led by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, inclusion of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälischen School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the Municipal Teiloffensive.
The city's civilian offensive had launched the event on the occasion of her ten-year-old existence.
She appreciated the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" at a very full cultural station soon.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players make up two teams sitting in front of each other.
For each side there is a view screen, which includes four cards with keywords that you can uncover - the old trick with the red folding - only when you have inserted them.
So it is guaranteed that the opposite page can also not read by accident.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. The worms.
Fourth party."
These are the terms that must be encrypted.
This is not the concepts, but the codes.
A player per team is the encrypter.
He gets a code card on which maybe "3.4.2".
Not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes are advised in "Decrypto".
His task in this case: he should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms of "warf", "feast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent team does not win the match if he manages to break the code twice.
The encryptor notes and reads in a loud manner: "Werpen" for the worms, "Lose" as the opposite of fest; here would, of course, be possible as much as "Party" and "Prag" because he cared about in school and knows the window break there.
This is how we run rounds, teams for teams.
Although you don’t know the concepts of the opposite side, it can be better matched with any information the encrypter gives there.
Could be mysterious, but not to be distracted, so the recursions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessary for your team.
The most cryptic on "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule.
The players will probably have to study it quite long and thoroughly until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who first released it will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this unlikely game.
In general, Decrypto is not just as decisive as the predecessors and the genus Primus "Codenames", which also pushes an agent theme into a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And for those who are just about rates and not about winning points, he can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man showing Police Hitler Grusse and disturbing guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old employed the police inspection of Kulmbach in the night of Saturday to Sunday twice.
First, in the upper city of a past police strike, he showed the Hitler grudge, and later, he also fell in the upper city in a knife when he disturbed other guests.
After he was not strongly alcoholicized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the prison cell.
He must then be criminally responsible for the use of trademarks of non-constitutional organizations.
Operating work Pressig was home of the shuttle blocks
The railway operation in Pressig has been the rotary disk in Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railroad history ended.
"When a buffer climbs on a buffer, you hear it very pressing," Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
Nobody gave up that.
Then the brakes also quietly and the waggons cut off.
That was pure railroad.
Declarations that are meaningful to Dinkel's Homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was such a place characterized by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen bergstreet to the north, which, after a rise of about 220 meters of height, has its shade point in Steinbach am Ford.
To deal with this, former train and shuttle blocks were required to have their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 stations, teaching stations, driving and train stations.
"Herzstück was the rotary disc, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a 1899 rebuilding," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, train historian and 47 years of vocational railroads.
From the railway operating plant (BW) Pressig, which was subjected to Bamberg in 1968, locks were also operated for the sideways Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Half.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported by a personnel stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were stationed at the time in Pressig.
The electricalisation of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shuttle blocks.
Since 1977, they have been used only for goods trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked per month.
Parts of the factory were broken down in 1982, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not taken into account a better use of the site, even in terms of goods transport."
Still on Pentecost 1989, Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years electricisation Nürnberg - Saalfeld" a pompous station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic viewers here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
A little later, that's out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were removed, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rankers and inhibitors did the hardest work in train traffic," recalled Dinkel.
Any misconception would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the reverse of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current images are here in the infra-Plus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won China Open 6:2, 6:2 against French Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the third world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kashstan or Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russin set on number 13.
It is now done with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and enjoyment" a special exhibition was opened on the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great ease, registered organizers and visitors view the ideal weather when in the open area of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Midehrenbach, opened the Special Vernissage "Windgame Performance".
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" as part of the series "Art and enjoyment".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor’s appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 Exemplars of 20 artists are now to be visited in Midjehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who as the main organizer and artist made himself a name.
But a little surprised, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven young hands with good future perspectives.
In the past, both have actively participated in the selection of artists and Flyer.
This year, at the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is again a 70-cent special brand designed by art & enjoyment, available at every art station.
This year’s poster “Betzn Dance”, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high performance of the special exhibition.
For the musical round, Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly understands that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately brings playful expression.
Artworks are made of metal or ceramic, often equipped with colorful accents.
At the entrance of the property, the visitor is waiting on the right side of the "lucks tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a wooden stump, colorful, playful with 20 wind rails, 24 holes and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bush in the background, the object acts marvellously disheartening and inviting to rest.
Barbara Waschneck comes from the corner valley, which is preferably dedicated in three-dimensional letters to the event for 15 years of K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in movement.
On halfway, Siegrid Frey from the corner of the valley has released her work "The Wind of the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his brilliant imagination images of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" is introduced through the versatile art exhibition.
By 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 Years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th Birthday celebration
1968 – This was the time of the protest and student movement.
And also the Albanians at that time made their discouragement air.
At least five of them.
They did not want everywhere to find out that after the dissolution of the Church's Emperor "Cecilia" there should no longer be any song life in the town.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the tinnenbush they raise the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Home of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanians singers.
In fact, on the anniversary, they had left the foundation celebration again.
For years it was a tradition, then there was only a break.
At the time of the 50th anniversary, the tradition party was back there.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothes before.
The guests were not sitting at the "House of Meeting" in seats, but comfortable at tables.
Meanwhile, movement was noted: DJ Matthias Drees from nottuln moved the regulators and asked for the dance area.
It is honorable that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice clear.
Suitable for the occasion, happy songs were noted.
It's almost said, "A day as beautiful as today."

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-quality derby against BW Aasee
The rider is walking.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the control of Axel Büring is well available in League 3.
No trace of shame or fragrance, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
“It wasn’t clear, but we’ve already left the impression,” said some kind of satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately told him: “This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not satisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening of Ronja de Boer’s subsequent birthday celebration, the mood was good, the game was deleted.
Yes, the result is actually an optical fraud.
In the third sentence, the guests had a betball.
"When they bring it to the goal, such a game can go ahead," Boring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to the goal.
"We all know who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break us the nickname.
I have seen a fairly good volleyball,” Annacker did not hate 0:3 and immediately moved to the agenda.
Wherever the trip goes for the independents, after just three days of play, it seems unpredictable.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one sense he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
In the fourth league, they don’t want to look downwards anyway.
If the west is not contaminated in the next few weeks, you have to look upwards.
The first balance can only be reached in ten or eleven parties.
It’s only going to Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will take place in food on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller has become a star on the dream ship.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have had a conviction to her husband with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Chefhosts Beatrice of Ledebur on the Dreamship made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she left aboard forever.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failure to marry Hans von Borsody (1929-2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
“This could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled alone with a bag around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me to the eye," Keller said in a conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First, she had always been just "the wife of Hans von Borsody," but that changed with the "Dream ship".
Now the journalists are only calling to Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible for her then husband to be quite jealous, but "how many men frightened Hans talks about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be for Hans von Borsody "the only right person and he wanted not to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have made myself, as she further explains.
She always felt “not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I never had in truth, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously disarmed marriage to Thomas Hardtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could also be a second time."
On the day before the official marriage, I was sitting in the wardrobe, and I wanted to reject everything.
Borsody’s marriage also failed.
Why didn't you ever manage with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller made love “as in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I’ve come to love too naive.”
The nightfaller, who regularly explored the city’s nightlife at the NZZ resort in Zurich, has waited for the ZFF Opening Party this time.
Our wallet is not a moth, but a little light shit.
And the glorious brightness, in which a green cover is dried on the sixth place, blends it over charge.
But it’s a film festival, there are more or less celebrities wanting to sun in the light of light.
In this late Thursday night, he turns over the place to make it easier for a short time in the "Aquaclean WC Oasis".
This is what the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, celebrates its premiere at the festival: The needs facility in the parceria of a new pavillion, there is a lot of effort to flow into a luxury atmosphere.
However, this evening, in the Lord's Oasis, it goes to heaven for some reason.
So come out here, along the other side of the street: Geladene guests who have been entertaining in the cinema near the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the festival beginning with a party in a three-story good house every year.
Its name is perfectly suited to this film party: from all over the world the works shown are known.
What you need to do in an article about this festival is not to do anything so that you don’t fall in the marketing for 190 partners.
The wheeler binds a belt around the sensors, which has hid him a good fea, and two bold doorsteps actually wrinkle him generously in.
Inside, the geladins press to dance long after midnight to live music, or to give themselves to DJ rhythms to which they scream to each other, and swim down with cupli exquisite caps.
In the delicate store in the subterranean, outskirts are waiting for sharp mouths, nearby the incomparable raw chicken Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut off, a chocolate brown sprouts.
And the hammer is: all the sales shops full of exclusive products have not been scattered for the occasion.
This has been the way for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The roller studys the shield at the roller stairs: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the roller stairs."
If these are two separate instructions, he has entered the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, which has already saved life.
In the houseware department on the upper floor, the birds picked up a cocktail called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mixture, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been working for said brand for years, isn't here in the evening.
But since, between local prominence, cashtable and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor may not be far away.
And really: Viggo just walks Mortensen, with nearly sixty acting like a chorknabe, through the crowd.
He isn't fitted, he isn't talented, he's supposed to be ruined.
Just for this restraint, like being misunderstood, international stars love this movie party.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is looking forward to the victory of his team.
Argentina’s football legend Diego Maradona seems to have been well enrolled in his new homeland in Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the Cabinet at Cumbia rhythms, as seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored trikot, fired by the players.

Handball: Association League 1: U.S. Send to Last-Minute Plate "Destroyed on Earth"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the U.S. Handball Leagueist, could hardly realize that "so a bitter defeat". His guards were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germany 2.
They hadn't played badly - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - over many stages, the senderers.
Only the initial phase "we have total sleep," the U.S. coach was upset.
The house lords quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken, did not produce at first.
"But then suddenly a ruck went through the team," Bieletzki caught the second quarter-hour together.
For a break, the remainder was only two more doors.
Especially Send Bester, Marius Hintze, encountered another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from sightseeing.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst compared to 15:15, then the seasonal exchanger led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the progression was still apparently calm three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take into account the unpartisans in the event.
Bieletzki usually protects himself from searching for the guilt of others.
But: The 120-second time punishment that Steffen Mühlhoff cast, "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and encountered four more times until the end – during the deceased U.S.A. failed in the last attack.
The boys fought greatly, also stood back well against seven men, and threw again on an empty gate.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damned victory has to be done," said Bieletzki.
U.S. Gates: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pole (2).

Elon Musk, founder of Tesla’s electric car manufacturer, has defeated his threatening debris as the head of the billionaire firm.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC made an extrajudicial dispute about counterfeiting Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run stock exchange-notated companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million per year, plus Musk assigns the Chairman’s office for three years, a comparable position to the German supervisory board.
He must remain the Chief Executive Officer.

Musk is not conscious of guilt
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company from the stock exchange, paying $420 per share that has been funded.
Tesla would be estimated at $72 billion in total.
Musk later turned back: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a chairman from outside, appoint two independent board members, and also establish a committee that monitors Musk’s communication.

46 percent wants Merkel to be Chancellor by 2021
Following the curriculums of the past weeks, the GroKo casts several survey strikes.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has first overcome the SPD in Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD raises a number of 17 per cent, the SPD gives a score compared to last week, and falls to 16 per cent.
CDU and CSU also lose a number and only gets 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union on Sunday.
The greens reach 15%, the left 11 and the FDP 10%.
If on Sunday the Bundestag elections, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43% of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the large coalition currently has lost the majority in the Sunday question in all major research institutions - with the exception of Allensbach.
Government parties are constantly reaching 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
At the Bundestag elections in 2017, they received 53.4 percent.
In other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second-largest party in several surveys, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach votes from 12.5 to 17.5 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, the FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys, depending on the vote, have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent upwards and downwards.
But also the retention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly declining since the 2017 federal election.
Only 48 percent of the citizens currently find that Merkel is the right in the Chancellor office, as the Emnid survey found on behalf of BamS.
According to the survey, only every second (50 percent) wants the large coalition to hold up until the next regular federal election in three years, 41% are for a new election.
In a further survey published on Saturday, there have been clear popularity incursions for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should be nominated for the CDU presidency again in December.
47%, according to Emnid, are against 44%.
64% of the members of the Union wish to be a candidate, 35% do not wish to be a candidate.
Expenditure at Aldi: price-reduced for love luck
Is it going to be Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in Tinder’s times there are no romantic dating stories no more - they should have fun at Aldi about chicken meat.
Munich - In the times of the digital Fastfood Dating by Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost an anachronistic romance as a place to meet the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced chicken meat, boxer short snacks at the wheel table or the favorite pudding is doubtless still a better story for later grandchildren than just a swipe right.
The app Tinder is in reputation to be less a contact but rather a screwed stock exchange.
We have watched the test: How do women react, not long in the first message around the hot bree?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood love story potential has it when the love luck comes out-of-eye losing and recovering-plate.
If the guy still reports under the e-mail bio-puten meat@gmx.de with his officials, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and concerts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has shortly discussed over the "30 percent reduced organic poultry meat".
For the belief in the magic of the analogous knowledge, she has certainly earned her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Image cover: 500 covers for a life without parallel
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerschule has participated in the action "Cover against Polio - 500 Cover for a life without child paralysis".

Polio is deemed to be extinct in Germany, but there are still three countries around the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of polyomyelitis, which are polyoviruses, can so far be darkened only by vaccinations, as it is stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have requested the end of the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.

That's not good for the boy.
And that’s not good for us,” said Reus, a god-friend after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV broadcast Sky.
Zorc had emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No hurry at contract talks with hecking

Football: District League: Researchers show up of VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine
There were moments in this young season, when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wordkarg, coach of VfL Wolbeck’s footballer, moved back (inside) to understand the lack of performance preparedness on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhove Road again.
Taufrischer documentation is the 1:1 Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, which has only been overwhelmed in the last game period by the rise of the SC Altenrheine.
Yes, I am very pleased with the show.
“We made the rooms close and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought every single person to just say "Thank you" for so much rivalry against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from 4-4-2 almost closely into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in front of him.
Wolbeck had significantly more games in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his (17th), the interchangeed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
It would almost have happened when the SCA in a minute 41 just two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer dangerously crashed in front of the wolves box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved himself a master of his fack.
After the pause, the VfL freakly took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed shortly.
Schroer came too late after 58 minutes at a thewes entry.
With the variation of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left left again missed a fresh cell course.
When Altenrheine Chris Naber Treumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters before the guest house an indirect freelancer for the placehers.
The Foulte joined himself and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right bed struck at the bottom left from the view of the shield - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes that should be for a long time.
And then that: VfL Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the strafroom unfortunately to his hand.
Judge Husseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed the point.
Jannis Schneider could not escape the gift (79).
For a few minutes, Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute of twelve meters had yet to be the winner on the pushing.
Maybe it would have been too much good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Allbright Foundation Report: Women Stay Rare in Business Leaders
Only 8 percent of the executives were women on September 1st, as the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday, and presented before the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will get through them," founding business director Wiebke Ankersen said.
In the United States, the UK or Sweden, purely male occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - are no longer thoughtable.
The remainder makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It is a different corporate culture.
In addition, the slight increase in women’s share among German stock exchange companies is only due to positive impulses in the median-sized index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8% of the boards are women.
Last year, however, the value remained at 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - foreheads in recent years - the female share stagnated.
Later, 26 women worked in the boards.
“I’m sure the Dax companies will recruit more consistent women next year – in their own interest,” Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that there is no self-engagement to increase the share of "null percent" so far.
Another image of the supervisory boards arose: On September 1 there was 30.5 percent of women - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
“If you recruited as many women each year for the boards, it would have reached 40 percent in 2023,” the report said.
Some even make Miese: Luxury Cars: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?
The best Ferrari deserves.

Big cars, big profits: This slogan is still applicable today - in most cases.
Who among the award-winning providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How many luxury manufacturers cash per car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made 69,000 Euro operating gains – Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only takes about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on it for every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good at EBIT’s rates in the race with an average of EUR 33,000 to EUR 38,000 per car and approximately EUR 3,000 wins before interest and taxes.

Driver of the emergency vehicle and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released by the forces.
The 29-year-old, also severely injured, was able to get rid of herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another recruited emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police are determined in close consensus with the Bonner Prosecutor who bears the blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we unpleasantly
After the blaming out in the League Cup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of defeat may still be spoken.
Significantly, the scene in the 74th minute, when the recovered Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had probably brought the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected of being offside at Mark Nobel's passport, all Manchester defenders remained standing, and Arnautovic allowed the ball to overthrow all the time in the world on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative point of a previously inadequate performance over long routes.
At the moment, United’s city rival Manchester City is very different.
Citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion for an approximate 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem steerled for the home team for the first time the defence belt of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero provided after a good hour and a double passport with the former torch for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for jumping to the table head.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 match in the League, Xherdan Shaqiri fought against Liverpool in the Premier League 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slider.
After the Reds had started with a make-up balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp’s team in the Cup, while the Blues Liverpool fell from the top of the table.
The two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (in contrast to Watford) also celebrated 2:0 wins.
However, the fans of the Gunners who played with Granit Xhaka had to endure a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately bucked a heritage by Alex Iwobi into his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third seasonal meeting.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth consecutive victory, passed to Watford and is just right behind the great rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton rising under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained inconsistent at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time and ranked 8th place.
VW Nuclear Mark Lacking: Paris Automobile Salon in the Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic, but in general: the diesel scandal and the ring for driving bans and refurbishment should not be dismissed by the German automotive companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automotive Hall, they will show their news from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel no longer plays a big role.
The possible exchange and re-equipment offerings for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, may still be an important topic behind at least the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and have their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingol Citys will come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
BMW's iNext will start until 2021.
The center of Paris is the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4th to 14th October.
In addition to automotive companies, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange for the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi during severe earthquakes and the following tsunami.
Dozens are missing.
There are more than 500 injured.
The island was shot by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first beam had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, enormous damage occurred.
After the beatings, the Tsunami entered the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will still increase significantly.
The numbers are only from Palu.
However, there are also many other municipalities - along the western coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final goddess service for motorcycle drivers in the peace church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place before the peace church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final goddess service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and is responsible for the soul-care concerns of the strong PS bicycle drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle goddess service (MoGo) takes place on the last Sunday of a month at the House of Nordhelle.
The end of the season, the bikers traditionally celebrate the peace church in Eveking.
About 150 bikers gathered there on Sunday to do something else that is not the usual worship.
At 10:00 p.m., the Bolidens had risen in front of the church’s entrance gate.
Initially, the biker early shoes stood on the program and it could be reinforced with coffee and cakes or even with a delicate curry rod.
In addition to the MoGo team, there were also the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach.
The ministry was held during the Biker-Goddess service priest Dirk Grzegorek.
For the musical painting, singer-writer Valerie Lill took care of.
"Although bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests more poetic-sleeved sounds," says Professor Frank Schröder.
This was also a new day in the history of the motorcycle goddess service.
Fechtorfer home companion celebrates great feast: after apple milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Boris was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple potatoes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in the luggage and demonstrated his stunning viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the great trickery.
With a little muscle strength from the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Many of the children have not yet imagined how to be a delicious drink.
However, they could also take a look at this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the strap of apple pieces that look slightly like heaves.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice runs back and forth into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already completed specialties.
So he opened his "church box" and presented the elderly visitors with the latest Federwhite.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was therefore large.
In a friendly atmosphere, parents came into conversation, while the children could not only pursue the process of apple pressing, but also discover the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active of the Fighttorf companionship of former soldiers engaged in the party and invited to some stations to play too shortly.
In the coming year, the home association will also offer an action day.
But then, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house will not be the place of the event in the heart of the Spargel village.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the theme on the hand: Finally, it will go around milk.
1:4 vs Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season spot: "Crazy situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga retreat, coach André Breitenriiter gathered his disappointed professional from Hannover 96 around and gave them courage.
However, there were a lot of positives not seen before at 1:4 (0:2) of the table late at Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to go out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and said, "It's naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot of it."
The further sealess Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86) was connected, stand down with two counters and are a departure candidate in their current constitution.
Due to the overwhelming Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached 46,300 spectators in front of the DFB Cup winner, who, after the successful general sample for the European league game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the midfield of the table.
Croatian Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost any dangerous offensive of the hessians and was never able to deal with Hannover's defense.
The storms that have long been attacked after the WM showed with its pace and executional ability why it is so valuable to the understanding.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by the FC Liverpool was also the first time in the early form of the Frankfurters, who started swiftly.
Lucas Torró's fake headball on the tournament for the first time threatened.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped at the last moment by the 96th opposition to the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term defeated Kevin Wimmer.
The leadership for the houselords fell almost mandatory and totally deserved.
Philip Kostic lifted the ball after a reversed corner into the strafroom, Haller extended per head in front of the door, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defence player arrived in the summer by AJ Auxerre.
Frankfurt still took a break.
This time Haller fits his storm partner Rebic, who managed to think and 96-tower Michael Esser gave no chance.
During the half-time, Hannover coach broader driver responded to his elf's weak idea and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Axes now played a bit more boldly forward, but sinning ideas remained shortly before the end, as anyway, the connector still succeeded.
The wizards were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then put both on De Guzmán, who only had to move the ball into an empty door.
The rest of the Frankfurters were only still shooting against overthrown guests, even Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party meal
Despite cold temperatures, good mood dominated at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Riiter managed it before millions of publics at the opening of 185.
Munich'n with two hits last week.
Geishas: Geishas Christians celebrate the Holy Cross Festival
The Geisha Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festive goddess service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the finishing victory.
The Holy Cross Church hosts the Shooted Christ, derived from the 30-year-old war, and has shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the shooting wound, blood flowed.
From this a large wallscape developed to the Shooted Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not been finished until today, just the altar room, the lack of the landing house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, the priest Adolf Buhl reminds that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The worship was badly visited despite the importance of the Geisinger Pfarre.
After the divine service, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church, and with the end, the church part of the Cross ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church nurse has been invited to the world part of the festival into the Catholic priesthood.
The members of the chorm provided the visitors with refined meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and weather adapted, farmhouses.
In the afternoon, the pastoral community still offered guidelines around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the pastoral community about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstones and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until the next year.
After the equipment has been standing for some time, the damages could be detected more accurately and the individual tenders were prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned because the damages already existed a few years ago have grown larger, but it has also been found more, which has only been possible by means of an open-minded apparition.
The soccer drilling work is completed, before winter it is intended to start with the natural stone work, and we hope that half of these work can be completed this year.
Introduction: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid of Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities on the Munsterblickstraße.
That in the Munsterblickstraße it is now to be given a "very special house" of its determination - there were all the attendants agreed at the date of introduction.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers, who have lived in the residence of the life aid in the Donau-Iller for some time, are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wide gates, loops and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free accesses for all areas has taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in its concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was placed on the test station for residents with mobile cap: "The house had come to the years and was no longer at the time in the equipment," Bader said.
In 2016, the bagger started to break the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well, according to the architect.
Donau-Iller opens new home
Approximately €4.6 million has invested life aid in new construction.
The free state amounted to €2.4 million, the district of Schwaben 450000.
The construction works have remained in the planned framework according to Architect Bader - timely and financially.
He also thanked the director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spaghetti between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many tasks that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Likewise, Gertrud Kreutmayer, director of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house focuses on the special needs of its residents who need help to be mobile."
In this way, homeness and functionality have been well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real happiness case because it is no longer to be purchased in today's situation."
Overall, the new residential house in the Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time staff who are all hired at a rate.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the Vice-President of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all the people of the country not to meet with the participation of East Germany.
There are differences that pain after nearly 30 years of unity.
With these differences we should not be satisfied,” said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day level on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but paid 15% less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone for nearly 30 years after the German unit,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this kissing dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is intended to shine the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has made South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
According to Moon’s office on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then passed the border area Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animal's "usuality".
The dogs with the thick white belt, spicy ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gave had announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean power owner Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang mid September.
Both countries also agreed to participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply for the 2032 Olympics.
During the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri testing system for rocket drives.
Austria's Movement History in the Mirror of 99 Documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which is celebrated in this Memorial year for almost ten months, there have been numerous new books that mostly answer this question in view of the past hundred years.
However, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archive, stated in the magnificent "Bilderbook" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New week, new chances for the government
Back to work - so is the informal motto for the working week of the Great Coalition starting today.
A interview, almost a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD, and also from the CSU have not only mantrally sworn the "real to work".
This may have caused some craftsmen, doctors, cashier, and other occupational citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but that's it.
If the federal government is now so far to devote itself again to its mandate - the government - it should not be stopped by definite debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamings of the last weeks, it may be shown already on Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties will meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to regularly summon these rounds to eradicate conflicts early; a lesson from all dispute.
First, however, issues are again conflicting with the diesel feeding equipment and the immigration law of specialists are on the agenda.
CSU Traffic Minister Scheuer wants to make car companies with exchange premiums clear, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to technically refurbish older diesel.
While an approach to the diesel crisis has declined over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far away from the planned immigration law.
The SPD requires a stay perspective for denied asylum seekers who work or are trained.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "spur change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again a dispute between the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally, GroKo has joined itself, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
The dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is not marked by such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not come forward.
However, to be constructive, the dispute should not be rebuilt for party-act reasons on the issue of being or not being.
It’s still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD are to fight – but always have the reality of people’s lives.
What is madeable and useful to many?
With this guide question, both the diesel and the trace exchange question can be pragmaticly clarified - and thus recover confidence.
This is especially why the people have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister of Vision
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the current service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" their lawmakers had worked on social insurance reforms, a overwhelming social minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the list-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Kiin (FPÖ) is surprised - she now brings the matter to Parliament via request.
She assumed that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and, in any case, not to announce violations of the applicable service law before current cameras."
However, she now has questions to "shave Har tinger" from any suspicion.
Police are searching for women's laughter on a road
Marxgrün - Lange did not want the police to express themselves.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, it has been buried on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is still closed in the Marx Green area until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
The dog specially trained for the scent of old human bones, along with his leader, in multiple use, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, along with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian top monumental protection authority in the area of the said street piece, a ground abnormality was discovered.
For more than a year, the prosecutor’s and criminal police court has been dealing with the missing case.
At Marxgrün, a bike road has been shut down and investigated with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that during the rebuild of the state road 30 years ago Heikes’ body could have been shut down here.
Colour powder and eggs: cravalle in Barcelona for Catalonia's anniversary
The contested independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time on Monday.
But it’s already happening with cravings.
The separatists have not forgotten the use of police in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum of October 1, 2017, there have been conflicts between separatists and police in the center of Barcelona.
The Catalan security forces were attacked by the supporters of independence, among others, with color powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and civil guard.
About 3,000 police officers in Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honour their colleagues who were in the last year's illegal referendum in the election halls.
When attempting to prevent citizens from giving voting, violence also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separately, Spanish media reported.
Some of the approximately 6,000 separatists had then attempted to break the police chain with violence, and officials, among other things, were thrown into colors and eggs.
Six people have been arrested, 24 others have been mildly injured, calling the authorities.
On Monday, the independent referendum will be held for the first time.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the Central Government of Madrid Catalonia had put it under forced administration in autumn 2017.
At that time, Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement remain in sub-detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the official entry of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional President Quim Torra is the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratlessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split
Red-white ails continue to take place.
At the FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0:0 uncertainty.
The final light and the third spot spotted them in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald Stadium as collected rolllessness.
The first half of the entertainment factor was angry.
Anyone who wants to get a beer or a bracelet could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torch, because there was almost no.
First shooting after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) torshot of the whole game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibility had the Ahleners, as Cihan Yilmaz FCG tower Frederic Westergerling, forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the stratum border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly occurring longevity.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel targeted nearly 18 meters over the housing and after an hour, the goodsloher also appeared offensive for the first time.
After Matthew Wieckowicz’s ballooning, it went fixed.
The quick-presented account about Sinan Aygün "cronate" Nick Flock (62) with a shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they played with a headball of Wieckowicz (66 years) after an angle ball of former Ahlenor Tim Manstein.
Angelo Daut responded to RWA's interim strainer, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and somewhat later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It worked – nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not succeed.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing in.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: “I like to play zero,” but unfortunately, the zero also stood forward.
“This time we weren’t as dangerous as against wooden wicked and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here,” said RW Ahlens Interimstrainer.
Offensive "plated everything so slightly" against a team that just wanted to defend.
“I didn’t feel like we could get a counterdoor,” Daut said.
As a spectator, however, he didn’t feel like his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too likely for that.
Reckfelder Harvest Thanksgiving Market: Luckily there are enough creams
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are welcomed from the Reckenfelder table tableshot for which these donations are intended.
The honourable officers assured: "These donations remain in the back field too".
At the opening, the sky appeared brightly blue, but the place was still a bit empty, but this should still change over the course of the day.
"It's so nice here, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl Outfit as always with a regular prize humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was actually to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer in the short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creams.
And the "replacement" could not take place to interchange musically with the increasing visitors.
This happened so well that some folk songs were met in the late hour.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to stay the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is excited about the many activists with their stands, including mostly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he still thanked for the action of the male chorus.
Andreas Hajek praised the efforts of all those who were in use at the stands and also enrolled the further festivals held in September and the "clean up" action.
Our garden town gives us a colorful stick - here's something going on.
Then the Maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken with the help of the firefighters and brought to the Winter Quarter.
On many stands were worked for physical well-being.
From sweet to heartbeat it was all to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in the field for only a year, has become creative in his decoyers.
Furniture work, beer cover with rack fields motifs and much more he had in the offer.
A specialty sent three reckfields Imker: "Reckfielder honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted well.
The conviction is that the visitors then left away for a long time until the evening, even without a program of scenery that does not exist during the autumn festival.
Smireries with local political embassy: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknown people have thrown in a rarely favourable way for the construction of a skateboarding plant.
In several places there are corresponding scratches, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, police have filed a criminal charge for injury.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich" are taken on paintings, among others at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19, a corresponding writing draw was discovered on the ad shelter at the stairs up to Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of his time seemed to have been left "only" with an edding, it could be easily removed.
"Some days later, but that was back there, this time," Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising shield must be replaced.
A special note gets just this case because on the table are also referred to as several large companies from Longerich.
If the skateboarding is built, it will also be enabled by sponsors.
Promises are already made, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the city’s specialty department to call school, sport and culture, without names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies on the shaved table.
For years, local policy and administration have been engaged in the topic of skateboarding.
After the old was decomposed at the LWL clinic, after some time, the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke with a majority for the fire park.
However, this sense has not been implemented - too many factors seem to be opposed to a construction at this point.
At the end of June a return was followed.
Members of the Chief and Financial Committee voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It is based on a decision this year so that it can be built at a positive vote in 2019.
Engpass in aviation insurance becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg Following the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air carriers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes,” said the head of the Air Force Association, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the airline summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight accidents is the long-known personal note in European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
“The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years,” the trade unions said.
In Europe, the market for finished-trained lots has grown up.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace were missing about a hundred people.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt on Friday, representatives of the Federation, countries, airlines, and airports will meet together to address the causes of delays.
"When you want to talk about additional work dilution and overhours, it won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, who has many members at the German Air Safety.
Maas was again responsible for the EU Commission's measures.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been too low.
The costs and savings of personnel in national aviation insurance are now fully involved in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to engage in regulations in Brussels that "do not further abstract the air".
Currently, EU data will be voted by 2024 and further worsening will be feared.
The EU has been subject to constant lobby pressure by the airlines.
"Ryanair's Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now just what they have sown themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines will be resumed.
The GdF will only participate in improving the situation when the German Aviation Insurance (DFS) offers a "voice training and future" pact, Maas said.
The recording of 120 Lotto students annually over the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet associated with it.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board is right for company construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board have voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp’s Chief Minister Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board on Sunday, the crisis group is to be divided into two independent societies.
Both companies should have their headquarters in food and be noted on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known cuts in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control committee on the capital side counts only eight heads.

Barcelona: Violence in demos by police and Catalan independence advocates.
During two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, approximately 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as approximately 6,000 supporters of independence demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a great order to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
Independence supporters, however, repeatedly tried to break the security shutdown.
They had attacked the officials with color and shooting.
There were ranges, according to the information, also among the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue officers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and value of colleagues
Police, with their demonstration, wished to respect the colleagues who had conducted almost exactly a year ago against the independent referendum banned by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
The members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they.
The demonstrators emphasized it as a provocation that Spanish police officers had demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come to protest here?", the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they've dishonored us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Baleans, who wanted to name his name only with Daniel, rejected the claim.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there for implementing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were “not here to provoke,” the police said.
Panne allowed access to personal data by British Minister

According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the pan was announced a day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve coach loving for top match: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese Star Storm has "played the best game this evening along with the half hour of Valencia," Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after 3:1 (1:1) the record master's victory against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive star purchased even without his own gate was the crucial man in the main match against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and made it good," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door – and since then we have grown up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three torch templates, Juve turned the game after the early remains by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and first hanged the worst persecutor.
The Tor Hunter obtained by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double package (26/49.).
And Ronaldo, after one corner per headball, also performed the pre-eminence of defence boss Leonardo Bonucci, who was 76, who had to die just before the tournament.
“He has a lot of templates,” the coach praised.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see doors from the attacker who is in both the Champions League and the Portuguese National Team of the Record Tower.
“We need to be even better in serving him,” the coach said.
The best Juve tower guard is Mandzukic with four matches - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than €100 million, Juventus’ overpower seems to be even more exaggerated.
Seven wins in seven games are the makeless series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the rear seven years already has six counts on Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti was unlikely against Turin.
However, at the latest after the reference of the already warned Mario Rui (58), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get to Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We have played well against a good Naples," said the tournament coach.
There was also an opportunity to feel Emre Can.
The German national player has played at Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was in use for all seven league parties.
The midfielder also played at the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had fled out of the place at the tournament's 2:0 victory and was closed for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a particularly stunning performance, Rapper Kanye West gave attention to the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.

The 41-year-old also announced a name change at the time to publish his new album.
Fortan, you can only call him "ye", as the musician.
"The essence that was previously known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the deceased singer Prince, when he gave his artist's name.
The pseudonym is not a news.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRRL, the artist stated that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
“I think Ye is the most common word in the Bible and there it means you,” the rapper said.
Football: Circle League A1 Münster: Finally!
You got it!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hit from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more striking, we have put him as good as never to problems." Accordingly, the list of Hoetmarer's insights is read thin.
Grade two torchs in 90 minutes so that rare games can be positively shaped.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendinghorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a high angle to early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen could have increased uphus, but after great pre-processing of Krause, he was standing free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne failed at Torstecher Jos Shohmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the sendinghorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) gave them all.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the doorline with the hand and saw it red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide put the ball over the line, the match was decided (81).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hard, which was different today than in the past few weeks," Florian Kraus said.
Sendinghorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circle League A2 Münster: Spektakel football in Albachten: GW Albersloh subjected to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to do,” he said.
"We haven't got any access to them," he probably said with the wing songs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that emerged with collective offensive strife.
Nevertheless, he could laugh: "A damn victory," he said, twisted shit, and, on the contrary, the relief of his players was noting that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Note, after a duel of two teams, one of which is Albachten, playing for the championship, and the other, Albersloh, fighting for classkeeping.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“This was our best seasonal performance,” he said.
"How we return after 0:2, how we oppose one of the top teams of the League throughout the game, it was really phenomenonal."
It seems more bitter to have to go home with empty hands.
Top-gate hunter Lars Zymner brought the host with his 12th season meeting in leadership (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
He placed the 2:0 on the left-hand side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but a player like this can’t be completely out.
"It was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent jealousy.
Shortly before the side change, his own elf achieved the compensation: McGills freestoßus sealed from left between Hövelmann and Concordia guard Hinkerohe through the long gate (45.).
After the side change, McGill again achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went and went.
It was an action-loaded game.
Nubel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later, Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite the surplus, Albersloh could no longer count the last Concordia trigger (80).
Now we need to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
“The game against shampoo, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Joy (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nubel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Famous guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-year.
Due to this, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to collect the Tolerancy Prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as a federal president he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there to be a guest.
The Academic Director Udo Hahn, who proudly said, "All federal presidents and federal Chancellors were already with us." The fact that the Academics in Tutzing castle was resumed, but there was also a theme in the presentation of the annual program.

Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron also said he wants to personally receive the "Tolerance Award" granted to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which is also received by television moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The 80 meetings until mid-2019 are in itself.
“The retirement is not sure,” says in a meeting title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And for a meeting about Syria: 'Barbarians without borders'."
Weapon deals, destruction, torture, death - war prevents every human idea."
From structural racism in society to the shades between arm and wealth to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academie-director Hahn said: “Free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions.”
At a meeting at 200.

What about neutrality?

Music cabaret: Gender Understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfalske News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening at the Church of Christ in Wolbeck.
As a Kabarettestin, Teubner pressed the understanding of gender, not only with humor and heart heat for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) man and what else could be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and mastered her violin as well.
Ben was sitting on the wings.
He is one of the male savings partners, who sometimes come to words even to the end of the set, and the other is a true pianoist: so congenially harmoniously accompanied by suveracity teubner that some may have desired a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, namely, as it fits with the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradox in the game: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: what would have happened from Mozart's composer if "the Nannerl" had unexpectedly opened the door?
Thus, the swelling of improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll Symphony to a playful dance.
There were great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers gave Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasure master of the association, the chansonette.
However, the Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck could not take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to send the Duo one in Wolbeck alongside the events in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Gardening and Landcare was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit view at the Kulmbacher Association, the last founding impulse for the Circle Association for Gardening and Landcare Kulmbach was placed, and precisely 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbacher City Hall.
In addition, at that time he called another name: as "Kulmbach Town and Land" he was raised from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also, the purpose of the Construction Association differs from today’s work – it was actually about fruit construction, flowers and gardening that no one thought about at the time.
"During that time, during the era of the enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," Cirisheim career Günter Dippold explained in his statement.
Fruit trees should sow remote roads, so-called industrial gardens were planted at schools.
The plant construction is still the task of the 55 garden buildings in the Kulmbach country district, which includes nearly 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is not too exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition plays a role as well as providing knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile are the task areas of a garden building company, members of the Hutschdorfer Youth Group "Maulwürfe" have shown entertainment on the stage.
“Youth work is urgently necessary, especially in the digital age,” said the Circle President Günter Maid, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed how important experiences are in nature for life.
The collection of Kastanians was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of pleasure with smartphone & co. similarly.
Schramm promised to plant two trees for the anniversary along with Land Council Klaus Peter Söllner.
"Where they are to be standing, the Circle Association decides," added Landrat Söllner and emphasized the particular importance of the garden buildings for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern for the many garden building companies in the countryside, there was no doubt about this as well as the circle business leader and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He conducted the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, the need for self-care after the war.
Before, everything came from the garden, for the winter it was entered.
However, at the end of the 1950s, the utility garden has turned into a zip and residential garden.
"Nature has stock, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the specialist for fruit and nuts.
Therefore, it is encouraged for gardening companions not to leave, so that our home stays beautiful and living.
It also includes welcoming new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We have to stop the eclaiming decline in insects, which is our fault for our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded with the successful strike, which was celebrated by the tournament glasses of the Thurnau Music Association.

Priority on Oil talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister Releases UN speech
The Mexican government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: they make both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada’s Foreign Minister now prioritizes the Trade Agreement - and moves his speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure on ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland moved his speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of today’s Saturday, the minister will speak before the United Nations plenary assembly only on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
Meanwhile, it focuses on the new negotiations of Nafta.
Mexican Economics Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that Canada and the U.S. negotiating leaders had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade deal already signed between its country and the U.S.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed in August to re-establish the regional free trade agreement of the Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The conversations about a new edition have been running for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump’s government wants to submit the deal to the U.S. Senate before October 1st.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro injured in a knife attack has left the hospital.
The former extreme military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, according to a report from the newspaper "O Globo" where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances in the South American country last week before the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on an open street in early September during a election event in South Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele non" (in German: "Then not"), women's associations were calling for protests against the former military.
Also on social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and women’s disrespectful statements.
Thousands of demonstrators were expected at the economic metropolitan São Paulo.
In the capital of Brazilia, the protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was appointed by former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for corruption and should therefore not apply.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As former Mayor of the Millionaire of São Paulo, Haddad was in surveys so far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, he is present as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate at the first round reaches the absolute majority, there will be a choice on October 28.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not come out of this successfully - no matter who he goes against.
Bolsonaro is known for being honored against gays and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is always shocked with verbal deflections.
Another time he said the followers of the Lulas left workers party should be shot.

Not only does the vicious, just ballooning "Take Me Home" cover the shift from melodic passages to the guitar-loading rock rifles of the multi-layer songs.
The quartet "The Ignition" made from Tönnihäuschen has played a special degree of popularity since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band will present its hard rock on Saturday.
The "The Ignition" with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tournament in China - has a special stage experience.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays in collaboration with the band at the evening's only covering song, "Word Up" from Cameo's 80s, very own accents.
To feel even higher than previously disabled sound, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a refined solo while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to a genus such a hardrock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night the mixed team's three-concert at "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of press air, but is still significantly under the controls of the "Wake-Fesit Val", pointing to the "The Ignition" on its website.
120 decibles in dust-drive volume, as usual in the annual metal staircase in the north of the Republic, do not necessarily require the ahlenaire audience at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky shirts have long convinced their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
“We are standing here, we have taken the bones and burned a concert with the power of a tiger,” all three groups, freely transferred, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailing plane is crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.

The crash station is only close to a fixed tent on the airport area.
However, since this weekend, there is a October party.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the lift to the autobahn 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer at large events at the Essen Messe or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump says Kim: “And then we fell in love with each other”
The fact that U.S. President North Korea’s power holder Kim, despite the nuclear crisis, is not a secret.
Now Trump has made a regular statement of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters”.
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president became a new flame.
The tragic: It is a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made North Korean power holder Kim Jong Un an unusual love statement.
Before supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost already sharp words for the half-old speaker of the Pyongyang government dynasty, although in the ring of North Korea’s nuclear destruction is proven to be quite narrow broken.
“I was hard, he too, and it went between us and us,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
His personal connection has also been politically fruitful: Trump refers to the stop announced by Kim of all atomic and missile tests, even if critics see a little bit more than lip recognitions so far.
That the enthusiasm for whether his martial threatening celebrity "Rocket Man" - Trump's top name for Kim - would not be any memory, seemed to be quite aware of the U.S. President.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of this at his appearance in a large gym in Wheeling City: “Donald Trump says they’ve been in love.”
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
He took care of this very little, Trump explained and then addressed his finger to the crowd: “I’ve always told you that it’s so simple to be presidential.”
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this orally filled arena, but we only had 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Best visited, moodfully and overwhelmed with sunset: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair, Baesweiler’s city centre was released on Sunday.
For the first time, the October festival was not only held in the festive tent at the fire tower, but was extended from the trade association on Sunday to the city.
Refugees rescued video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic imprisonment conditions in Libya using a mobile video, allowing their rescue.
The group had rotated the recording in her cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under life-threatening threats and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Finally, the refugees were flying to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, to the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger, according to his own statement.
One of his counterparts was almost killed by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the detention conditions were disastrous: "They struck us all with pipes and stacks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repatriation of refugees who are buried in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their home this year using the program, IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional, taking into account the bad detention conditions in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a phone call, but he hasn’t heard.
International organizations have criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps for a long time as inhuman.
The North African state, which is dominated by too large parts of militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the public school place on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lesson for Monday, she surprised a breaker.
At 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
At the front of the first floor she saw a man who fled immediately.
Only through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a stitch into the ground floor or the prefecture.
The teacher agreed with the police that took up the investigations.
Whether things or money have been stolen, it can’t be said yet.
Action description: approximately 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please note to the police inspection Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
Germans were arrested for days in their own car.
A 75-year-old had to endure in a forest area in Central France several days and nights in his car after he had driven the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the truck on Saturday afternoon and released him missing since Tuesday night, police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was found in good health, despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was now looking forward to his home.
The retirer had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his land car across the local branches and fields.
Despite intense search measures, the man's stay was unclear for days.
Lashchet is entering the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne’s NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) urged Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overestimated", Laschet said Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly detention waves, press and religious freedom.
According to Erdogan, “if the relationships are to normalize in the future, if the economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for it.”
Laschet also reported the cases of Germans sitting in prison in Turkey.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of expression will be respected.
Erdogan once again emphasized the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was moved in the short term to a federal defense ministry’s airline preparedness building at Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place on the castle, but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on after the conversation to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had rejected a joint appearance in the building.
He said, “The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact partners - not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea demands destruction
While U.S. President Trump is not tired to emphasize the successes in the negotiations on the denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more narrower.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a Washington counterpart.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho urged the U.S. government to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest stop is therefore that the United States builds on forced measures that are fatal for trust training,” Ri said in New York City.
It is unpredictable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first to disarma ourselves," the North Korean Chief Diplomacy said.
The fact that North Korea could force criminal measures on the knees is "a dream of people who don't know us."
In order to build confidence, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear plant, Ri pointed out.
However, there were no “responsive reactions” from the U.S. side to this, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year on the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly comply with criminal measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korean power holder Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to Pyongyang to talk about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which many visitors to the open door house of HoT had nothing to do with: white ceiling and flower jewelry on the tables and a great buffet waiting for the guests after the Ernte Thanksgiving service.
The teens of the HoT had a buffet with delicious delights from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the youths wanted to thank for the meal.
It wasn’t easy to start with the new setting, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembered.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were perfectly prepared for the great day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a electricity failure had put off the giant, two-party refrigerator, the food was corrupted and had to be removed.
“We had to start again from the front: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbours, the children and youth wanted to do it alone,” Westbuer said.
And so they all packed with.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Better can't cook either," a visitor praised, while the Hokkaido cup soup was served or the guests were allowed to serve quiche, liver chicken or cake.
“It’s really great what the children and youth have put on their legs,” emphasized Prince Frank Beckmann, while witchmaker Stephan Lammen with cardntricks and other pieces of art made surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW head of the table
From frustration over criticism from its own rows, the chief of the Essener table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the country's association.
Sartor became known all over the world because the Essener table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as the deputy chief of the NRW tables in July, Sartor of the "Welt on Sunday".
I liked too many in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the NRW Tablen Country Association, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
“I can understand his step – there were people who didn’t know exactly why the Essener table did that.”
But Sartor is still active for the Essener table - “six days a week, because nothing changes,” Weilerswist said.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the World on Sunday.
You shouldn't follow the approach, "without us, the people of the city are angry."
It is the task of the state to ensure that people are not angry.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of tables on Friday in Berlin.
“It’s too sweet to me,” he said.
There are all these social fuzzies that criticized me at the time.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two of them took the Jawort on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for her, Kahrs had previously said the "image" schedule.
"When we get married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a domestic political spokesman of the SPD Federal Day Group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD fleet.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for gays, Kahrs had excited an angry vision on June 30, 2017.
He had thus appealed to Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "secretized" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in allegation to the accidental announcement of the DDR border by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, homosexual couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had previously been able to sign their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters heck cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizen Association Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of height around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründner house should be cut.
Supported by the residents, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the President of the Citizen Association Walter Schröer.
And it has also gathered so many.
Due to the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately, it’s just a shade.
For in the spring, you have already shot the heck.
The next breakfast at work has also had a long tradition.
“We all have to stay in power,” said Walter Schröer.

Two years ago, he had missed Olympia-Bronze for three hundred test clients.
I was well prepared, I had already had enough ride here at the facility and it’s all gone today,” said London’s third Olympics in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and rectified both arms securely to the height - surely that it would at least be enough for a medal.

However, the six remaining starters could not exceed their fable time of 89.69 seconds.
Secondly, the Czech Jiri Prskavec became the Russian Pawel Egg.

Fortunately, the criminals failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to use again.
This is how the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on the Kingswieser street is due to the alarm system.
This happened when the criminals invested hands on Friday at 20 a.m.
The kidnappers said that the residents weren’t home.
But the alarm system apparently surprised them so that they took the escape without delay.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Wide by Hertha: Retrieved from reality: Bavaria against Ajax
The prediction is intact: the defeat in Berlin wants FC Bayern "not to fall down".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim phase for Niko Kovac's official period.
The first small power partition under the new coach Niko Kovac will never rise to the larger autumn depth for Munich.
“A week ago, we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a bit of reality," Thomas Müller noted after the 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and asked for a response to the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us knows that we're really angry and that's why we give gas on Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year out there has not been a fired door, as at the same time of the season two compulsory games in series without victory, the table performance in the football federation league was first lost at Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the missing Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-off man-vs man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle sticks over the outside, have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last overwhelming Bavarians have to break.
"Those who know FC Bayern know we don't like it and we're going to do everything we can to succeed again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, he and his losers in his hometown surprisingly surrendered to his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the re-manufactured deal with opportunities.
However, a victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first interim phase of his term positive before the country’s pause – otherwise the tone might become worse.
So Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second royal class appearance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second pre-running game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens to start with 3:0 sovereignty.
"Now it has captured us in two games, but we're going to make our doors again," National Team Captain Manuel Neuer said.
As before the lost cup final against Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke in the same position.
The defender appeared in the role of Mahner.
“I don’t think that’s all the bad thing, we have to work again because we don’t make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind,” the 23-year-old stressed just before he left the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game game, the Bayern were even with five counts behind Dortmund, which now took the top again with a point of prejudice.
And so Kimmich appreciated at least positively that the public debate about the possibly intact Bavaria has now ended.
“Yes, that’s fine,” said the national player.
For the league, it's good.
DFB-boss in line: Özil-Cause: Sharp attacks by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious charges, Turkish President Erdogan pleaded with the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post will be created.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on various stages for the deuting shoe in the lasting theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president criticized the deal with the former world champion in Germany for the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the alliance line.
Early Sunday morning, Grindel personally attacked by Özil in the Mainzer ZDF "Sport Studio" announced the consequences of the cause.
"We need to make very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-groups - that something like this is not repeated," the 57-year-old said and wants to win a national player without migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel recalled that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
He had strongly opposed racism to Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown in Germany Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were allowed to photograph with me in England,” Erdogan said in the Dom city on Saturday.
Honestly, I couldn't digest it as her president that our two young men who were up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan’s statement that, unlike Özil after the World Cup affair, he felt “reasonably treated by the DFB” by photographs of the two of his first with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced to want to stand before players in the future.
That someone says, “If I win, I’m German, if I lose, I’m a Migrant – that’s not going.
"It's such an impression, I'm so sorry," Grindel said.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see the basis for a return to the national team.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, will now be called an additional integration representative.
“When a non-immigration background clearly affects society and football, saying, ‘The issue is important, then we have to take care of it’, it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the grounds where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil affair, he will re-nomine for the office as president of the DFB next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it goes," Grindel said.

People who want to provide their bodies in the case of death may be allowed to register there.
Your wishes are then revoked in case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs can be withdrawn only with explicit consent, Swiss transplant stresses.
It is expected that 15 percent of Swiss have a donor ticket, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They then have to decide deputy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," he said.
A similar registration system is already available in the United Kingdom.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donations on the health care card, as said the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can submit their wishes - for or against organ donations - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken for a re-regulation of organ donations.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as organ donor unless he or his relatives opposed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is a world champion in head counting
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the headquarters.
He joined 39 competitors in Wolfsburg on weekends.
This was reported by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the outstanding place of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany was the third place.
The youngest participant of the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the eldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, according to Chief Historical Judge Ralf Laue.
The Zwickau (Sachsen) computer science professor organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday morning, where participants joined guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel greetings from lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while counting.
He is one of the seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Hello, he was at Bielefeld two years ago when he was 14 years old.
With terms such as super brains, genius, or wonder child, organizers can start a little laugh.
"Counselors can be trained," he said.
Many participants exercised a few hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even computer competitions directed at stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root strip of six-digital numbers.
When calculating versatility, candidates will receive surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also had good chances, said the chief judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often beneficial because there are more intensive and more effective methods to learn in early childhood.
Invasive appeal: Video with nackter Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ass Serena Williams appears from her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to indicate breast cancer with this video and becomes strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and intelligence.
Serena Williams sings above without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only their hands hide their most intimate positions.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, in which the early detection of breast cancer can save life.
Serena Williams had died almost a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency OP was launched to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were subsequently discovered in Serenas lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government plans a clear expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
The next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding draft legislation on the so-called "Symbolic Law" to review.
This aims to significantly expand the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are included in the prohibition.
Polare cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle will take out her beds next week in the West for the first time: Polare Cool Air reaches on Monday Vorarlberg, North Tirol and Salzburg.
According to the Meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamic (ZAMG), the snowfall limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in narrow valleys it can snow up to approximately 1,000 meters at strong intensity.
From Bregenzer forest to the high farms, it is expected to exceed 2,000 meters of 20 to 40 centimeter snow.
On higher roads (Arlberg paste, Timmelsjoch, Bieler height, Brenner paste, Gerlos paste, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore wintery.
Farmers can start with annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers may begin with the annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green waves" in Germany have been characterized by the landscape of the Walderman Federal Land for about 200 years.
The trees and trees that are up to five meters wide are "forest substitute" and for many animals and plants the last retreat spaces.
Knicks connect living spaces that are distributed as corridors, which may still work for the exchange of organisms, as the Director-General of the National Protection Association of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living cells
The books were established on the basis of an order of the Danish king Christian VI, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein in 1766.
The "living caves" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also supplied the farmers bronze wood and bars for their specialty houses.
From that time also his name "Knick" is derived: "Umknick" of the easts could develop dense, flooded delimitations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea extends about 45,000 kilometers of the hills and gives the image of a wide, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are currently used as a substitute living room of about 7,000 species.
In a kilometre of knick, they could live up to 1800 different species and crash up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly taken care of in winter.
Otherwise, he is concerned with a light tree series that, in addition to the variety, also incorporates the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Knick care may be operated only outside of the brute period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
According to Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the German Redaktions Network (RND) the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi following the earthquakes and tsunami:
Have you been on the site during the Tsunamis?
No, I was just in Jakarta at that time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning, because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours, as the airport was closed at the time on Palu.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be flyed.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our "World Vision" office has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also hosted other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are ransomed on surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some people stand in front of their homes, there are still abuses.
Because many food stores and gasoline stores are completely closed, people are partially clumsy food and gasoline.
The public service is completely down, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partly freely running around and searching for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have a phone fight, but before that it hasn’t worked, and we have only received information via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbours, and other people they don’t know if they live and where they stay, because people were not at home during the earthquake, but for example on the way to work.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information about it?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not encountered by Tsunami, there was misinformation that a Tsunami encountered the region and they are landed on the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Fire Ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
There are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and practice evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure is broken, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB has to resign long on Aogo and Donis
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle injuries for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo joined a muscle fiber rice in the back left oversneak, the football federationist reported on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle compound rise in the Oberschenkel.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably be missing even after the next country gambling break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for the failure period.
A muscle compound rise usually cures within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rise usually cures slightly faster.

Biathlet Julian Eberhard winning the WM Medal
Fourth place at Olympia Biathlet Julian Eberhard was in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to recover the missing metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in Pyeongchang’s Olympic Spring that was near the medal.
Seven tenth customers missed in bronze at the end.
“I’ve been aware of time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The more motivated the Pinzgauer is to recover the missing metal in the new season: “The goal can only be to come back to a big event with the Constitution to win something.
Sometime you need to beat.
The World Cup in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: “I have already closed the path in my heart,” he recalled with joy at his fourth World Cup in the single race last year.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned understandings is strongly limited.
With an FBI survey at the turbotempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the sharp majority for the judges Brett Kavanaugh who are disputed for claims of necessity.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged incidents that have been going back for more than 30 years.
The latest tournament in the drama about the Kavanaughs vocation accompanied by a cultural struggle was launched on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer was angry with the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed to be safe when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared his original announcement that he would agree, but request an FBI investigation.
After dark scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the severe talks on Thursday as "Bechiss", first contained further attacks on women and spoke on the contrary of "happiness in unfortunate".
In this way, the last doubts could be scattered,” he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election campaign strongly because they refused Kavanaugh: “They try to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
You will be targeted to investigate the known accusations of two women, no longer, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: “They don’t go on a fishing trip.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses should be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the city municipality Ried to monitor the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road from Monday, October 1.
There is also the federal school centre.
The city community also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt fear
Trainers Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season win.
However, the factor of time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - Christian Heidel is now known to be a huge pessimist in football games.
This wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball inside.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our strafroom,” said Schalke 04’s sports manager and breathed.
Finally, the King’s blues were still able to bring the nearly 1:0 against the Rhinehessen over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and the fack.
In fact, it could have come differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creator 11 of the team of Cheftrainer Domenico Tedesco gave security, Tedesco had said: "In sum, the first half-time was good, both playful and from pressing".
Really don't create a headball memory
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, and so they continued to withdraw.
And defending with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three numbers of the season.
"We all enjoyed a huge stone from the heart," Schöpf said, who had no insignificant share in it with his headballer: "I am actually the worst man's headball player."
But in the end only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurefully in the initial phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played smart, quiet and courageous, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest shortage of the afternoon: the King's blue missed it, rather to worry about clearer circumstances.
The possibilities were finally there, for example, by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a conquering victory," Tedesco said, "you've already felt the fear a little bit."
That's why I'm glad we've won.
He wasn't the only Schalker.

Prof. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses Integration: A discussion on the height of the eyes
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He was repeatedly followed by the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've been doing my job to bring interesting people to Greven for many years," the founder and chairman of the "Reckfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates with the alliance "Culture Policy" in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani is very lockerly entering the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult it was to understand the subject.
With lots of gestures, hand-resistant figures, and one or another joke, it brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly occurring despite successful integration?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metapher.
At one table, the German society is sitting, at the cat table, the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they always sat at the big table and now want to co-determinate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether it is politically right or left, but "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
Initially, the discussion runs more and more.
And there is re-necessity.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on the stage, a meaningful picture of the discussion: it’s on the height of the eyes.
The professor of sociology does not excite his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual destiny.
He is delighted that there is interest in the subject, because "the first time we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing hours, he has been discussed intensively in the course of preparations for Kurdish specialties, as well as in the foyer, with an open ear for the questions of the guests.
Basketball: Bonn and glue win start-up games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Basketball Bonn have ended the first match day of the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) with a home and outdoor victory.
Gießen took place in a hard fighting party in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Middle German BC.
The ambitious bonner won at the BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first table guide of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55-Gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
There was much more effort at the beginning of the new game period of German champions Bayern Munich and former series champion Brose Bamberg.
Munich had already won at 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won at Frankenderby on Saturday at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84:80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 lands
The need is apparently huge: more than 100 stakeholders have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first grounds in the new construction area of Landsham-South on the open market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 plots that offer the community at cheaper conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
A good 100 applications have been made, so Frick.
"The documents are currently reviewed" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Mayor Plieninger, it is intended to have the candidate list for the 20 plots set up by the end of the year and present them to the Municipal Council.
After that, the award can be made.
In total, 50 plots for single and double houses are created in the southern area of Landsham, as well as four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
The conclusion is now as well as completed, the roads and roads will be held as soon as possible.
One single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality Pliening.
It sells most of the free market, 20 pieces of land in a social-total model.
The two multi-family houses of the community are to be built as a affordable living room according to Frick.
With a total of 16 income-oriented apartments promoted by the free state.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated to create residential space for about 200 people in the area of the new construction area of Landsham-South.
Not only that: Now, early October, Frick says there is the start for the rebuild of a children’s day.
There are three groups of children’s gardens and three groups of cribs, as well as a multi-purpose space.
The opening is intended for September 2019, to begin the next childhood year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo "big sport" succeeds on the bank as well.
For the third time not in the start-up: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in consecutive, not in the Schalker Startelf, but in the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the Brazilian, nearly two meters large, had spoken so well of the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered over the FSV Mainz 05 after the 1:0 victory, as usual in the middle circle, and thanked all of his professionals, the 36-year-old, whose name is Naldo, turned on and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his Vice-Capitan, who despite his re-reservist Dazein, did not raise any groll.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker in the past season, knows that he hasn't actually been on the board with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him about it.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm honestly saying that," Tedesco told him the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the start-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the matter, it’s about the association,” Tedesco said.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He is 36 years old.
It’s important that everybody can go through it at the moment.
And that we all stay in the boat,” Tedesco explained the rotation that finally captured Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by showing himself also at the bank as an excellent team player.
The mood in the Austrian industry continued to accelerate its landscape in August compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points at a 37-month depth.
However, Austria, across Europe, has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute reported on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still the 13th month in consecutive, under the 50-calculator brand.
In August, only Ireland’s industry had 50,9 points to beat this threshold.
Finally, the Greeks were (42.1 points).
Although in Germany, France and Spain the mood barometer declined, it was slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"Although the slightly weakened valley could mean the worst has survived," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter anyway - remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not seen: export orders in the euro zone have fallen as strongly as in November 2011.
Consequently, the companies set up the seventh month in succession.
In China, industrial production decreased stronger in August than initially assumed.
The mood barmeter decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchase Manager Index supports its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in revenues, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised, among other things.
Tuchel's PSG team managed to win in the eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 19:45 pm
Nizza Trainer Thomas Tuchel joins Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship from victory to victory.
At OGC Nizza, the title defender won two matches from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league game.
Lastly, Olympique Lyon in France 82 years ago had put a good start to the game.
The Brazilian Neymar introduced PSG in leadership after 22 minutes and set the end in the post-playing period.
Christopher Nkunku (46.) took care of the interim 2:0.
Paris also managed the general sample for the leading second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To start the royal class, Tuchel's team at 2:3 in Liverpool had to take the only obligatory game game at this season.
