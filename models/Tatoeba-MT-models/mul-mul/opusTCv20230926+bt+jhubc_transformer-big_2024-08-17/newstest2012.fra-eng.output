Parliament has not ratified the amendment to the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament, as part of an amendment to criminal law, denied the draft annulment of the paragraph on the accusation of Julia Tymosenko, head of the opposition.
In second reading, Members refused the draft amendment to reduce economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently incarcerated.
Tymosenko was sentenced to 7 years in jail in October for having concluded a priori disadvantage agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko called the regime's political vengeance judgment and has caused a process of suspicion of partiality of the court as well as in the West.
The draft cancellation of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 Members.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Liberation or Rebellion of Libya has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
We need to determine the winners.
As usual in the region, the winners of the election are Islamists, but are they moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Charia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a thief we cut our hand.
Women can forget emancipation, the non-respectives of her faith are passive from death penalty.
It is the Qur’an that will unite the dictator’s personality the society consisting of opposed tribes.
In Libya, it will rule such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we would certainly not like.
But our way of living is not unique, not objectively the best and would probably not be beneficial for Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamic warriors accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general who led NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated on every attack.
So when it comes to searching for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political allie without making any profits.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not militaryly deal with Libya.
Therefore, there is no problem for the locals to get rid of "crossed".
Without soil occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not as much and the West will eventually be proud of uninterested protection of human rights.
We are not able to prevent these charia fans from doing so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the face of investors.
A tornado of statistics took place on Tuesday in Europe.
Each state has published GDP-related information for 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated this last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The obligatory market breaks all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Eurozone Statistics Offices, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have previously published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP has a estimated growth of 0.5%, France’s 0.4%.
Both countries have changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better positioned than expected (0.3 percent growth instead of 0.1 percent expected), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 percent (the issue was the origin of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% over the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistics Bureau, it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the forecasts of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy had a growth of 0.5% in the third quarter, according to scheduled and periodically recalculated data.
The economy in the euro area and the European Union had a 0.2% growth between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had planned.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
Revenue on bonds over ten years is 28.45%
The yields of Spain and Italy’s obligations are rising to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The Czech bond income remains below 4% while the situation in the region empires.
Voices are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of the last instance .
The Czechs have qualified for the Euro.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
Football representation has succeeded in its most difficult mission in the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Czech and the guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
The Czech football has also defeated a lot of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed reporting.
No particular excitement during the first part and a large portion of luck for the second part.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Czech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification in the European Championship.
The Montenegrons were under pressure to the second part due to a precise Czech defense.
The winnings of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who had two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Chech, the Czech representation will not be absent in the European Championship next year, and in addition a 200 million crown award in the Czech football box.
In the first few minutes we played a football warrior.
The two teams were hard to pick up combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not come to pierce the Czech defense that has responded precisely to long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human bowl.
A few hundred students from high schools have created a human bubble around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in front of a potential Israeli attack.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Spain created a human bubble on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Spain where uranium is transformed.
They expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme of their country in danger of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) found in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
Israel has reported a possible attack of Iran’s nuclear plants.
Students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose aim would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program, the targets would not only be Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not take breakfast and take a carpet for dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolmates have a weight above the average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families who have a poor lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which human beings and the patterns around them evolve.
On the tables of obese children, for example, 50% more frequent carpet than in normal weight children’s families.
19% of obesity had dinner frites according to a survey conducted with a awareness-raising action “Observation is not a random”
In small-grown families sports is also not a habit, which is now the case for most today’s schoolchildren - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey conducted on 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and 900 students from the Czech primary schools took part.
It was the second edition of "Obsession is not a random", action supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have been enrolled in this project.
One of the decisive factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of proper diet and not enough exercise.
“Only half of the children questioned indicates, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast - in case - taste - dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet,” one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and carpet for dinner
Experts draw attention to the fact that to develop healthy needs some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone takes their own breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been reported is that one-third of the population does not take breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis for a good daily meal.
The questionnaire has shown that in the families of obese children, most often we consume unhealthy frites.
Almost every student – without talking about weight – drinks sugar beverages every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children who are questioned are doing sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed children chosen (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from the ideal, in the plan of a healthy diet.”
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meat and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a major preference for sugar limonade," the results of the investigation indicated.
For lunch, they are pasta that took the first place just before white meat.
The children did not want fertility at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very weak.
Cape on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"During the control of a group of participants in the survey who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness-raising session "Obsession is not a random," we were sitting at a well-determined will to go towards a healthy diet," the results of the survey said.
The most notable was, for example, in the case of sugar limonades as children began to give preference to consumer water.
Children often cook on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (speciality in Czech bread butter or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say.
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I was a bit angry because there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn’t think of what would happen later.
The exhibitions of three professionals in the specialty, character dressing and a seminar on what is happening on site.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we are to final exams and the more practical exercises and information are waiting for us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays, it's really "drying".
This time, with Director Alenka (there are no boys) we treated how to dress a woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically harm broad arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have come here to emphasize the character beautifully and also not to wear too visually the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hints and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hens in such a way that the jupes or pants do not pass at all, it is worth making it customized.
And you shall not regret him, because the clothing that falls improperly is invaluable.
In a custom juice you will feel much better than in the one that constantly slides, rotates and does not stand on the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can allow a style Tucker dressing, with pieces of coated tissue, or even brownies.
There are, of course, many examples of various appearances and I am pleased that I have all week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that there’s too much about what I have to do at home.
Every trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of fashion of personality and its appearance.
I'd have to "wear" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, this is a pleasure, because it is better to wear Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has taken nearly 100 pounds in recent years (do not take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and coat from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking of the graphical part of the styling is also important.
The stylist dresses not only physical, but creates, for example, productive pages in magazines (on products given trends for handbags, shirts, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphist, enjoyed all of this.
But this... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphist and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know to use it.
And a talented stylist knows to work with a single dress in a different way.
Variability is essential for this example.
Like, for example, this trench-coat that must be wearing in a classic way with a jean and a t-shirt as a lightweight but also it can also wear the naked body, with shirts and take it in photography as a dress.
Or just lift your sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
"Play with this," he emphasized.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: “To work you need to know the rules perfectly.”
“You can then start to counter there,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines sometimes we see something else.
No declaration on fashion showcases.
I know again, thanks to Ben’s fashion photographer, that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
I mean, for fashion story that will have a ten pages (and a ten models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least one fifteen.
And also, a dress and its combination with other elements appear completely different from in reality.
We need to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half of the success is confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists’ services remains freely.
And known faces sometimes regard them as unnecessary (just I know something but what I think passes in second place).
And if someone makes a styling on our part, then we have to count on the fact that it says to us with great probability a completely different size (small) than that it actually has.
We are then only browsing Google and make sure that the boulevard information reports the celebrity in question, whether it is magry or gross etc.
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know to assemble models.
He must communicate with people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing to make people guess, not flatter, keep their opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new elements, you can’t throw everything and tell him, ‘My God, what terrible!’”
“You’ll find some things you’ll find beautiful and you’ll advise with what to wear them,” Mario said.
This has shown us in a concrete manner what must contain everything called the "placovka" or the stylist bag.
It’s the one you hang around the size and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to the things clearly defined as clips, rolls for depilation or even feeding rings, there is also nylon wire (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which they would close a garment in the back, well-looking kit, if it's not too large or other type utems for the cargraf.
So that we were not only people who listen but who tried something practically they taught us how to resemble shoes correctly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the seed could collapse, fortiori outside.
And so we collapsed and collapsed.
We did not have the right to touch the shells so that we could not injure ourselves with inadvertence.
So we really need skills.
Mario enjoyed me when he blessed me for my creation.
The importance I make is not for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course
I begin to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a pink garden, but everyone says what he wants.
The need for speed Le Run is fighting across America.
Revision
Originally, a problem-free race is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
This fills up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone, but it is not worth anything if no one wants to do anything else.
The new subtitle The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the old race series Need for Speed and to get out of a kind of game from playable games that would not just count on points.
So we were curious how the passages will be added during which the main hero goes out of his car and does what he wants.
As this is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we expected.
These are potentially arcade race games but the whole draws down due to some unnecessary mistakes that have existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible fate by the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are taken into the adventure whose main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to resolve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the west coast wheel in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive the first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the steps planned in different environments that distinguish quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player doesn’t feel for a moment that the game offers something identical to him.
Some environments are overwhelmingly beautiful even if the graphical technical level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very nice visually.
In addition, tests are authorized from time to time by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sand storm that reduces your visibility sensitively.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well organized behind each other.
There is only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments you are trying to overcome the number of opponents requested (such as in a classic race) and then run against the watch (classical duel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation difficult for you.
The newness is the passages outside the vehicle.
It’s rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs in front of someone and you need to help him by sticking on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than what you expect (to be concrete there are only three of them).
As a result, it is just like this because this element does not risk disturbance and, in the context described above, is placed in the elements that allow the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is currently nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although you can find better in concreteness, the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So it's all right.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, the collisions are not yet at the point.
We do not expect this game of complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, the least idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight oversight, you sometimes touch each other slightly, but otherwise your car is part of crazy voltages.
Or they are in myths.
Thanks to the restart system, this is not really a problem but it really hurts you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you break the figure or have gone out of the decor the game brings you back at the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you need to restart the game since the beginning.
So it is more a tool, in the case of something not happening as it is necessary, something on which you can really trust.
Sometimes restarts do not help, and it is necessary to find the solution by remembering the route piece in question.
The big part of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that you need to pass somehow, otherwise that doesn’t happen.
Otherwise, you will meet in a given place of "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, five seconds in advance or one minute in delay.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily pass between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either sit down and turn them down or brake them well.
It’s equal if you go ahead of him because it’s “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always comes close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
During all the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This irritates most at the end of the game when you run on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at any cost.
When it passes in front of you it hides you the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you come into collision many times.
You can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline,but it is clear that you are boring quickly.
And it's sad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's happening.
And it’s equal to whether it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the race order is such as there is no chance to bore yourself or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the race.
You need to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change the car there, however, most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for cities, American big cylinders for straight roads and super sports cars with exotic atours on very technical drives, for example, on lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You get not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventures.
When you reach the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock:
This connects online with the Autolog function that compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult hits to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator indicates between 150 and 200 km/h (at priori) and behind you comes a metro coat that sends the car directly to the railroad.
In the writing we had a discussion for a few days to see if someone really thought about when creating this game or if the authors really take us for idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really super.
What is disturbed is that in more extreme situations, imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imagery no longer serves you to anything.
The sound is good and the track is at choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience, a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but you can expect no one to buy the game for music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game hadn’t had these stupid mistakes, we could say without fear that it was the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it is not finished.
The fun is really good, but prepare for the mistakes that hit you in your eyes with the strength of an airport reflector.
Students of velours in concert with the choors at Charles University
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivals that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Revolution of Velours with a musical part.
During the festival, 20 high schools and secondary schools have occurred.

Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union:
Czechs behave as negativeists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically abolished the balance between institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms and all players get used to their new role," Miléna Vicenova began his exhibit at the Faculty of Law, the Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the different EU organs and their relationships in such a manner that a large number of lecturers at the Charles University's Law Faculty might be jealous of it, she showed how much she took her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Ms Vicenova honoured the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
“From the beginning, the critics reasoned that it was fade, that it was a round-round, that it could not fill any mission, and I have to say that it cut the breath to everyone because it holds its role in perfection.”
“He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of a response to the question "Who is the European Union?" "Which telephone number should I call?", so an important step towards the unity and greater readiness of the Union's policy in the face of states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked paste flavour that feels very strong)
Madam Vicenova has also stated the agenda she has lived, lived and will live in a short time near the European Council.
She qualified the Czech Presidency two years ago to succeed.
The Czechs resolved the amount of financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the Ambassador's words, "the activity has beat its full"not only for the Presidency, but also for the financial crisis that continues to be solved yet.
It is also necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union, which becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it appears that the budget will be thin and for savings, what branch will be the priority, which countries will be the most, the least, to solve in the context of future negotiations.
The Embassy reminded her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or tortuous cornholes, bananas differently large or that no one has banned us from making syreckys.”
It wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czechs in European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us.
According to the Embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptic and people who only see things in their negative aspect more than positive.
It is also sorry for seeing such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault resulted, according to it, from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a small support from the Czech party.
In addition to a successive Czech Presidency, she subsequently emphasized the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when Polish, Magyar, Slovak, this French, says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is still doing this Visegrad group?' and it's not at all happy."
According to Madam Vicenova, in the near future there will be new strict budgetary rules that are waiting for Member States.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if it is at multiple-speed, which rather prevails a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area.”
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the reinforced cooperation institute."
First of all, it was said to cooperate with the countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corners.”
"There will be many institutes of this kind and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Madam Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis that all themes with an impact on the EU must be discussed between all EU members and not only the eurozone mememes.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator starts the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for the vocabulary that expresses the closest IBM strategy, the closest would be "long-term".
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm that feels very current and, however, has passed hundred years since its creation.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was thrown by the company's first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be resolved for little people want to think.
His slogan "PENSE" has become the fingerprint around which the life of a gigantic future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the foundation of the company's care culture developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that she remained faithful to its basic values, but was not afraid to change all the others around her.
This enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business, and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"delayed for the anniversary the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM people were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning in the discovery of talents – as one of the first companies to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus could have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the mind of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano with the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has done what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that he has many ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures a safe position in the business fields.
"Since the beginning of IBM had a rather institutional concept than a technological firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technological company but a company that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony from Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM – or the “Great Blue”, as it is known to the United States in the past 100 years, has grown up until it has become one of the world’s largest firms.
Of course, it is the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, services at server products to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Its discoveries include, for example, the banknote distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the disk.
This year, IBM became the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it exceeded for the first time in 1996 Microsoft.
Overview in advance
It is not all the innovations and manufacturing that have been the preference of the client and of the time - for example, IBM has failed to bet on a own OS/2 operating system, online Prodige service or IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on advance movement, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
For this, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft concurrent that is at the base and remains under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM revenue, services, formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preponderant place.
However, it was still in 1990 with more motive to participate as the strongest hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets for $15 billion, during that period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continues to invest and even since 2008, when it first surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the big economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Is IBM now going through the current crisis without being worried?
The IBM share price has increased by 120 percent since 2008, the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect that this flexible gigantic will maturize other crises.
IBM History: From cheese clusters to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York 100 years ago; it was originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - it was initially a brand used by a subsidiary of a company in Canada and South America.
The base of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the year 80 of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the former "pointers", pencils that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the company’s Supervisory Council.
Flint hired the head of a competing company Thomas J. Watson to help him lead the company.
The leader then made shadow to the founder of the company - it is based on Watson’s ideas that so far depend on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade – from cheese and meat trails to registry boxes.
During the first four years in which Watson was running, the turnover multiplied up to $9 million and began expanding the firm across the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the company that after 40 years of leadership he was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, the people and computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturn and in 1969 on the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family – the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sells its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the Pricewaterhouse Coopers Consulting company and began taking care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has succeeded in the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet”.
Its aim is to improve technology in areas that are not yet exploited, such as urban transport and management.
With regard to IBM’s trade domain, a “Smarter Commerce” platform has recently developed that helps businessmen manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It established its subsidiary in Czechoslovakia in 1932 and then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also Brno’s strategic outsourcing center.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a global research and development team that takes care of the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about his unfaithful husband:
Ivete, you can keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it's over!
After his husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up from his pink dream and returns home.
Only she couldn't wait and set clear rules for the future.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer at Bartosova at her home, she did not doubt her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not rest the singer.
And the grandfather in the public loved him.
With time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's connection and finally said goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome her on the step of the door of the house.
“He’s the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put it out.”
"He will no longer be my old donkey loved and lost, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," he left to filter Rychtarova showing that she was separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I’ll stay with Iveta and I won’t change.”
"My wife made a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, gardens, real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we are discussing in a completely normal manner but we don't cook together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he will not prevent it.
“We don’t sleep together and he doesn’t care where she’s going, with whom and if she has a connection.
“I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility on myself,” Joseph concluded.
Woman’s worst vices: Is this about you too?
If you ask men to determine the typical women’s disadvantages, they all, like each other, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines of women's vices that can pump the blood of men's veins.
Purchase
Do your half comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one clothes per week?
Are you happy to buy and purchase packages at the time of the balances?
In your case, you can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should limit their passion for shopping.
But will you say, which would be resistant to the lace-vitrine of clothing stores, to seek for yourself beautiful clothes and then try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant Insatisfaction
"I'm not too big?"
“I need to melt at least 5 pounds – should I start sporting?”
"Do you like it?"
Doesn’t these phrases remind you of anything?
Yeah? Yeah?
You are one of these women who are obsessed with their appearance.
It is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about its appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases, the more women become poisonous.
Odor and cleanness in the first place
It's like an infinite snake.
Wash the windows, pass the aspirator, clean the floors, do dust, dilute the bathroom - and this two times a week.
Do you make comments to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children they have gone out the washroom, crushed the glass of the living room, and that this gives you a lot of work?
In the case you suffer from this obsession, try to remember that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and purity should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for purity can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"With this survival used to the puppy."
“Do you want to put these old shoes again tomorrow?”
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this soap work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you don’t think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much work...
The Difamation, the Persiflage
Difamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly focused on relationships and are thus pleased to treat topics such as who, where, with who, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets us escape a little inoffensive persiflage here and here.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persistent, even ignore others and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a group of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped by participating in the victory of Philadelphia
The Jagr hockey player participated twice in Philadelphia’s victory during the NHL Monday game on Caroline’s ice and is again in the head of the Czech producing players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made another pass and was appointed the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, has also recorded two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told foreign-atlantic journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick."
"I heard it."
"Whenever this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux marked a goal of the first shooting of the Flyers.
A moment later, there was a second attack from the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the goals of Hurricanes for the pallet and presented it to the bowler Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a downfall, but the beginning of the second part belonged to Flyers.
Especially in Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he scored three goals, and Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the best three," Jagr said.
“I never thought I was going to play at the end of a career with a hockey player like him.”
"I'm really happy with this."
"I want to play on him."
“All these years at the NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not delete other complications that ended up with two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He touched the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the most remote corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the final goal of the match from his viewpoint Voracek.
Philadelphia has arrived with this victory in front of the East Conference.
Montréal’s Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo, he came out in second third due to a injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their advance of two goals lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not changed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the rear line was sick who mostly embraced the local coach rather than lost points because they played the match with only 5 defenders.
"It's nothing."
“We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young.”
“But there’s nothing to do, that’s the way,” said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement is not enough and we couldn't resist."
"We were just trying to simplify the game, push the palet out of our area."
For this we had limits,” added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender participated in Winnipeg's thirty-three attack and the victory on Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters participated in uax goals of the Jets, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travels especially in the countries of the Socialist Block, as travels to the West were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for vacation in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (the two in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have an inclination to the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not permitted for citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakia) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise the individual journey was not permitted.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travels to the West, however, it was necessary to make the queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that, it was not yet won.
The agreement for currencies that was the condition of travelling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovakia currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the West.
The Czechs were most often spending their holidays in the country where there were many houses and chalets that the Czechs had purchased and this habit lasted until now.
The Czech travel has been a huge revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum, the Czechs spent last year 4 million holiday days abroad in countries around the world.
The great paradox we do not know today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 as part of Yugoslavia of that time.
The removal of visa in the 1990s in the neighbouring countries of the West has caused a huge short-term wave of visits, especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakia could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see at least a moment.
For example, in Paris travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or pension.
The typical feature of a Czech journey was at this time to gain with itself its own preserved food, sausage, etc.... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown that finally allowed our tourists to be able to buy freely from the Western currency after decades.
Our level of life as well as the average wage increased that caused around 1997 another important moment.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started preparing tours with air charter connections since 1997, which through contracts significantly reduced costs compared to the previous ones.
At the end of the late 90s, Czechs had a visa-free connection with almost most developed countries around the world except the EU who later facilitated our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year and every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to the far away hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU removed the Czech tourist visa and allowed our country to remain fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3%) for the first time in history, and for the first time in history, more than 15,000 crowns per person spent on holidays abroad including annexed charges.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end up with a situation without a solution "one pat"
Almost 5 months ago, the Czech football is unprecedented and Ivan Hasek's successor to the Czech Football Association is still unknown after a General Assembly to be held in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement under which vote regulation should be conducted.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football leadership.
Hasek gave his resignation in June and during his departure called his colleagues to join and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek the football returned to divergences between the Association Chambers that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This proved entirely on September 16 when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly have unnecessaryly met at the Prague National House as negotiations have remained blocked and it has not even been questioned about how to deal with election.
There was no agreement on the fact that who has the right to vote at the General Assembly - only, it seems, statutory representatives or also full-powered officials.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, which states that representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The divergences continue about the rule for elections.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which, in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not bring anything to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the neurological point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round to not fall into bed.
"The dispute apple resides in the following fact: whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," one of the three vice presidents of the Czech Republic Football Association, Dusan Svoboda, representing professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round is the one of candidates who have received the most vote in percentage within the chamber for which he is candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to retire to win the candidate who will receive the highest percentage of the two rooms.
And the Czech party examines the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentage of votes.
“Only that would then lose the idea of two previous turns and that would completely reject the bicamera concept,” admits Svoboda, which includes the objections of the Morav Party and that it would be best not to change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he considers that the election regulation established according to the status of Pelta is the most advantageous among all candidates.
"I would like to vote at the maximum in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"For there are still no backup ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assembly," Victoria Plzen, who is candidate for the first time and who in his exhibitions defined himself in particular against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, there will be a new President in Nymburk and he believes that candidates will cooperate together in the future and constructively.
“The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone.”
"Football will be again on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer who among the three has the largest experience in leadership of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
“This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moraves, but there are tendencies to change the regulations to drawing.”
"This can again cause a blockade to the General Assembly."
"I hope that the healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement to all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but can say if the entire direction of football will be complete for the match.
The specially proposed flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were traveling to Podgorice among others did not depart for technical reasons, and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee on the ground of repressions.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which may take place Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister for Youth Education and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would be very pleased to welcome the parties in the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state dotation, the credibility of football, as well as the Czech Union General Assembly of Sports that must determine the leadership of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for his position as he does not see any right candidates.
If Plzen's footballer leader Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Czech Football Association (AFRT) would not be campaigned for this high function.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t present myself in the election.”
"But in the current situation there was no possibility to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik’s motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT that would priorly be favored for this election.
Paclik also stressed that if he won the elections, he would only hold this Chairmanship until the year 2013 scheduled for a General Assembly.
He will see a highly experienced and high-level manager who is not related to the world of football.
"I talked with people who would have the profile," he said.
“For me it was terrible when some told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football at the moment.”
"I would like to make this image change," he added.
What, in particular, Paclik is, is the relationship between Pelta and Plzen Roman Berbr’s Regional Football Union President, a man with a fake reputation known in the coulisses as a lobbyist capable of affecting the vote of the delegates of the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta occupies this position as President.
"If he wins, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favourable to football," Paclik said.
What is still shocking is the fact that the name of Pelta was pronounced a few years ago during an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta came out without any punishment.
“I don’t know what Pelta’s prestige would bring to football.”
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
If Paclik won the vote on Thursday, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly who had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go with."
"He has great capabilities"
“He would be able, for example, to appear as the head of the representation.”
"But as a manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September attracted great attention when he pronounced for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik said he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example of his ability to lead private firms, and he has also run the Plzen club since last year, which has celebrated with his support in May last his first division triumph.
“I have the power to make something change in the sport world and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would stop the influence of some stakeholders who, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," Paclik added, who does not push out his antipathy to the head of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow for more money from gambling tax for sports.
“This is one of the key points that the new President should take care of.”
“If this is the hazard hazard tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes,” he said.
Paclik does not take its current connection to the Plzen Club as something negative even if he himself claims that the President of the AFRT should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again connected to Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"This is not the ideal."
“I don’t see why I can transmit my shares from the Plzen Club to someone if I have to return a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should end bed situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates to the President Miroslav Pelta promised that if he was elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should end up disputes about the election regulation in the future.
Jablonec’s official is very optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburk and thinks that the success of today’s football representation should calm this warrior before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that did not take place, has just promised to dedicate itself to national representation and to obtain funding if it is elected.
He decided to be candidate at the last moment just before the past General Assembly and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president to be there on Thursday."
“They feel it’s the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association,” he added, but it’s primarily linked to the Jablonec club, working for many years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election there is a euphoria that ruled in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly of Statutes have been approved which were not perfect as everyone has seen."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
This is just the revision of the most important document of the civil association that has drawn all the attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take all the responsibilities in the event that this does not work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
He then strives, said, not to confront his opponents.
He previously said he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognized his training in law and that he essentially knows that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has not long attacked Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, stops criticizing Pelta.
"He has evolved in football for a year and has already had a few successes."
“His attacks weren’t the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"This is also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent, but remains faithful to the announcements he made in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national representation.
This should be a football win.
"And I would also endeavor to complete all the affairs that start with the Bohemians or the following of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately negotiate with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all football," the 46th candidate to the Czech press agency CTK said two months ago.
He also added that his nomination to the head of football would not bring any changes to people.
"I should get acquainted with all the employees," he said to Strahov, where there is an understanding of nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are disastrous scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is only one point of disagreement on how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it.”
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader in his head," Pelta optimistically says two days before the day probably decisive for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl was elected a new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, this would not like many people," he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the case he would be elected, we will start working hard.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various fields of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohémians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President, I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and performing football for youth."
"But I don't say I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competences within the Executive Committee so that each member can take care of a specific field."
“And I will distribute difficult missions to make football a big step forward.”
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will just start working hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He stated that he would not represent himself as a candidate due to a critical atmosphere.
“As for me, I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it is worth it and if I will have people behind me who will constantly put me backs in the wheels and make doubts on each of my actions," he explained why he was hesitant.
“A lot of people have said to me that I don’t have to give up because they would give up too.”
“This is a trust I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates it is also to continue working with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a great job in fact and I don’t want to let him fall.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I wouldn't like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election, the situation within the Union would come back as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in a systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
“There are people behind him who would make football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen.”
“I can reproach a number of things but surely not to support one.”
"I'm trying to be an objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he again confirms that he would be only a president for the Czech Republic.
“And if there is someone who says the opposite, I am ready to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Morava whose winner would be in the first division."
“There would be no situation like at present with only three moral teams in the division because the problem is at present to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, chairman of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel the support of the Czech Chamber who chose me his Vice President and knows that there will be success with me," Rajchl said among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, contract negotiations with television and game law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault to everyone.
While he says about Pelta "what he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
"If he had been elected, he would certainly continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a significant change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to destroy his successes," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue

Budapest’s magnificent swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can experience its blue miracle – and after turning the city or making a long walk – can let his legs rest tired in gasing water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder was on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was an object that should not be missed in his luggage: his bath shirt.
Standing on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cobbles, and swimming against the Putten marbles that waited for him on the other side of the pool and was missing to admire the New Art meticulously restored from these converted pools.
If a covered pool enjoyed it, she immediately noticed in her book all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architect Meder and she presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Jewels of Bain). Municipal pools covered in Münich, historical baths in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in Taunus.
She has conducted her “the most exceptional bathroom trips in Central Europe” in 13 countries. Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real garden of the bath culture.
Meder explains that she does not have much interest in sports, but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is irritating that swim holders must be discouraged to look at the blue curtains and cozy with the Javel Water Pointer while joggers breathe the perfume invoking epicea forests or can listen to the park’s joyful birds gasing.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should actually always be so lazy," the Vienna said.
“I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms.”
Water Surface Duplicate Architecture
A floating in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - well-being factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders were given a little more pain, swimming rooms could be a delicious thing for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, we have a water surface in swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on one side, but reflects on the other side however the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces appear optically in a double manner: high bowls, multicolored squares, tremplins.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interest report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives a desire to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during his research in Hungary.
Beside beautiful well-being baths like the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath with pools filled with water in the form of alcali and a bath with a Jádör in (Városi boutfür)
On the contrary, the outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the bath in Zurich you have the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the Arlberg enchanted from an outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a ski window from which you can watch it on the piste
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design is waiting for swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a OVNI that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, the steam rises from the three open plates, while in the background the mountains of Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of the water of Javel is not all of the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emit a strong oil smell, which is difficult to believe, to be found in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon sticks you to the skin as soon as you let you glide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she was located in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bathroom designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
By throwing a look through the window of the New Art building in red-black-yellow, it observed the development of bad herbs between the curtains.
She noticed a different effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only the neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its design in 1844 but also an Alhambra style hall that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the pool expert Iris Meder – and not just because it is originating in Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a beautiful performance that smelling construction styles are so different in such a great unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, the flooding into the thermal pool apparently is only a minor question.
Agriculture speculation
The German Bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to search for the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the head of the group would then have the consequences.
Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, it is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find that banks are unacceptable to speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business route because it increases the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the Foodwatch consumer organization order.
The study is based on a Foodwatch report in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann emphasizes that the speculation of the Stock Exchange on global raw materials raises prices and that banks share complicity to global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley do the same.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the opinion that beters have dealt with offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently from American competitors: He promises to investigate the complaints and says, “No case is worth putting in play the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group currently examines Foodwatch-Report charges.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - usually with recommendation.
At the end of January, the Bank’s chief will indicate the consequences to be shot.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on the rise in food prices shows particularly draconic how much today's banks harm the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculations," Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether the reputation of the Deutsche Bank is in play.”
Ackermann’s consciousness may seem at first glance surprising, but it is clear that the group’s CEO wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving its functions.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is planned within the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about potential losses, he has hardly to worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would stop investing in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires from 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven percent found this legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which betting on food prices is made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, stop all investments for which money is injected into raw materials speculations.
43 percent would not advise such a bank around them, 49% responded that they would think about the cancellation of their accounts to change banking.
The 21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion who moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and a Happy End: the Austrian flag for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell in ruin.
Now it is again open and is held at the exhibition house.
If you are enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its vibrant and courageous clusters and its new construction materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer is famous for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was previously received the "Grand Prize of Architecture" for its construction of steel and glass, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to date as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW home and adjacent bolt-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became famous internationally in 1973.
His flag project as temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Southern Vienna station, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened.
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to attach the works of art, so no good environment.
However, it has been used so long, until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has grown more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, now he has the name "Maison of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky hit at any point of view.
The new departure was well conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an artistic historian to a significant career among others in her youth of artistic patineuse, then at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she particularly led to the public transformation work with sponsors and the protection of monuments.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation has the same name has been exhibited there, a coffee and a library, and a office must be built there.
strict supervision, small budget
For the realization of Krischanitz, therefore, it was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded sensitively Joseph Olbracht’s secession and he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Vienna Technical University and that for him the flag was “a extremely important place” where he had seen “practicely every weekend” exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and his change of use.
During current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a fuser of energy," Krischanitz said.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the reinforced glass insulated in glass fiber was placed and the roof was replaced by a particular safety glass.
The thermal bridge bubbles were reinforced or replaced, and the coatings filled with amine were renovable.
Two undergrounds have made the place for the new operation, a light panel shaken between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Pavillon Schwanzer.
The outer doors of origin are remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against the red-brown rod.
And the movie room is even exactly the same as it was once.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
“Some materials that are good and cheap should be found, and also like the monument protection office,” Krischanitz said, and he draws attention to a crude underground soil.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and despite everything, it wants to "wake up the good consciousness".
But in this case the 21st century House is not in the wrong place, because if this is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is just the "central station neighbourhood" just newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And maybe another luck will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city to get a site in the neighbourhood of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a million-million winter crisis package.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid winter rail accidents.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter season-related rail crashes and delays, the railway company Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The newspaper "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be expected by 2015.
This should enable greater availability of vehicles and railway networks also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the denial of rail and rail facilities should, among other things, double and increase to 16,000 people.
The goal is to get rid of snow and ice cages until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the road devices required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rudiger Grube Station chief warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of rail accidents that took place this winter as well.
Last winter, the railroad company had huge problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in cases of difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for authorisation from the Ministry of Railroads.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railroad company has been doing for years, since it has to make the ICE train axis significantly more frequently at the workshop, after an axis break occurred on a ICE at the central station in Cologne.
German Bank pay millions of fines in the United States.
After the case of chief Josef Ackermann, there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not enough already, the past of this giant was trapped in addition to the US: the Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million (EUR 106 million), to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothetical documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator brings to major banks a whole series of charges, and this would have motivated cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would minimize the risks.
These documents lost great value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this, without the parties to initiate a trial in the court," a Deutsche Bank interviewer in New York said.
The Bank has not recognized any faults in comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and operates in case of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to fix the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other major banks in part, and in the summer he assigned before the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the issue of hypothecae documents, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bullet collapsed in 2007, This was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events have been dating for a few years, it is currently breathing on U.S. banks a storm wind.
Investors and supervisors have tried many remedies to obtain repairs or to penalize failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of complaints.
She rejected 18 major international banks, both of the U.S. real estate financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from having benefited naturally in hypothetical businesses of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank must also file a recourse to the FHFA, which is a total of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities demand that Frankfurter responds to "substantial losses" but not citing a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected claims as unjustified and said he wanted to defend himself.
WARREN Buffett increases 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the Finance Governor, invests colossal amounts in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, U.S. big investor Warren Buffett explains that he is not constantly investing in IT companies, as long-term evolution of companies only shows bad predictions.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and IT systems for IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Consequently, the TI IBM activity reserves the right to now call itself "Mr. IBM".
Buffett today revealed to CNBC’s economic emissions that he has purchased IBM shares of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM had never known anything about this commitment until now.
He welcomed the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"You've done a great job," Buffett strategically said.
IBM has spent some time on IT profitable services as the operation of accounting centers.
The pioneer of IT, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting and highly performing corporate computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in businesses he understands.
But instead, Buffett attacks the railroad, manufacturers of lubricants or machinery.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares from a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former back municipal.
This 81-year-old eighth-year-old had resumed in the 1960s the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company and built it as one of the world’s most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
But his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost unsuccessful sense of making money valued him the name of "Oracle of Omaha".
After Buffett’s investment announcement, IBM shares increased by one percent.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a stock exchange value of over $220 billion and accounts for Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even talks about a "blood ideology", which would renaissance now.
The murders of eight Turkish citizens and a small Greek business in the 2000s to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and anxiety.
For many German-Turkists, the spectrum that was believed to have been dead for a long time has resumed its appearance: since Mölln’s fire attacks in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with this extremist context of right against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, however, it has never been questioned.
However, the extreme right network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "Tel was the title of the online release of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper "Sabah" stressed that one of the authors had been a v-man of the Constitutional Protection, and concerns the fact that German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right burst.
It was reasonably the reaction of the Turkish community in Germany: it called for a quiet celebration this weekend to victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community of Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had been thinking about a ceremony of the fifty-year anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a gifle: "Germany's gift for the fifty anniversary" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German appearance of "Hürriyet" does not deny its unique conditions.
"that begins to punish," Tel is the title of Ahmet Külahci's chronicle.
It stresses that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and contributed significantly to the reconstruction of Germany by their work.
The action of the police was very critically perceived on Germano-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why hasn't the German authorities come to mind much earlier to do research in some of the suspected environments of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More than one is ready for at least rhetoric or even drastic means: “If the case continues to be scratched, it will remain to migrants nothing but self-defense and arms.”
“This will be the best self-defense.”
“Internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,” Selen wrote.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been well explained.
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has clearly shown to the Turks who live here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which discredit and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks have, however, aggravated the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Earlier this was the failure of German politics after the attacks the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln’s survivors.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish state, he was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech at the time, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how much German-Turkish lack of trust has been deep toward the local state of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts of broader clarification and re-evaluation of extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The lake scandal bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed in the financial crisis and, in the meantime, suffered from a crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
It wasn't exactly what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we met in July that he would occupy almost as spectacular a position in 2013: President of the Board of Directors of the Great Swiss Bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and profitable career.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, he said; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly achieved solidity and has made good observations on future colleagues.
"The UBS succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But since September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities merchant in London had displaced all the Bank’s security systems and had fired about €1.7 billion.
The head of UBS Board Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the President of the UBS Board has been considered suffering since - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more professor of economy and president of the bank, and he would certainly need an adaptation period.
At one point, he assumes responsibility for a bank’s strategy, which has just proved again that it has long deserved the title of “the biggest scandal bank in Europe”.
Indeed, the UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and from the other, it has been racing from a scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, saves the Swiss bank so proud.
This began during the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, quiet and solid, but also rushed, had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from an easy customer than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s largest banks.
That was an impressive thing.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich tells: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current optics, one wonders: how could I just be wrong with that?"
He's deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something did not turn round to the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retreated surprisingly, which was until then considered a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we asked why he was leaving.
The bank’s division had fled with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross of billions.
In order to ease this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have faced the cracks: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and a Arabian state background, which was passed in silence, to the point that we never even learned his name.
But that was only the first hit.
In April 2008, it became worse.
The bank had to re-announce billions of losses, the president of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland's second best-paid board in 2006, retired.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: UBS was, in view of its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased tens of billions of problem securities to the UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for convertible bonds in shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland has been kidnapped - because she has noted how dramatic this can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the overall UBS 2007 balance was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second was followed.
A few months ago, the UBS had failed due to a tax dispute with the United States and declared itself ready to publish simple customer data, which may have frauded taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS has published more or less that it has helped in tax fraud.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It was followed by the withdrawal from the head of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of the money of the customers.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: banking due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And as there was a slightly calm return, and as we thought, that the UBS would come out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of securities merchants: a single securities merchant of $1.7 billion before the bank noticed that something wasn’t turning around.
And it is published: with investment bank risk management, it still seems not to work.
“With the case Adoboli, we have found that risk management is too slowly changing,” said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a big German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their role, the one to become a guard of the great wealth of the world: not too high risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unbroken reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich will still be paired with the strong clishe of the Swiss private bank - it’s just a bit bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the central station of Zurich, which drives directly from the central station to the lake of Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are here prestigious, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
The jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here among the Swiss tradition shops as well as those of the Sprüngli confiscateries.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have lived here: from the National Bank through the Swiss Crédit Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
We get to the UBS entrance hall through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of them are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another dismissed the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Swiss Credit, as the head of a small private Swiss bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business with both major banks as well.
The UBS would have become too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say about it.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, this was the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then deducted: no European financial institution lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
“This Wednesday, the small country’s government coalition to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in their nation’s history,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book “The UBS crash.”
With up to 68 billion francs around, i.e. €45 billion, politicians agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was established, which was already too large for the small Switzerland - and recorded continuously an increase.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have complemented: a rich bank, but in lethargia with as a strong point asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former President of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great intellectual modest, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who broke a path to the summit with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have been faithful until the end of Wuffli.
And Wuffli would probably have committed a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: Exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the Wuffli Group’s leader always pronounced the same word of order: destroy Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of currencies and securities, she played a very important role.
Nevertheless, business advisors, who had the responsibility of it, emphasized a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the Fixed Income banking jargon, there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
UBS will have shortcomings at U.S. Hypothecae products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself in an adventure, which almost cost him life.
As a result of growth, it is both the bank itself as a management fund created before it in U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and transferred value documents based on American mortgage loans – but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long been trying to go down.
"It was still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The bigger euphoria the fall is brutal.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become executable and are so far banking.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the proposed business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: ending the investment bank, focusing on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go so far.
However, the investment bank has to atrophy firmly, as long as this is clear until now.
Bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present the world's future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italy-Switzerland was supposed to be transitional only when the bank was surprised to separate from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it was imposed: it has to carry out UBS businesses lastingly, the Zurich Bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
With what does she want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked.
He said publicly so far only that he and his wife were going to find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent cornells spread in cities
In many places, frogs are considered a "bird problem°" but experts claim that these very smart animals are no longer allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some love them, and others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. Corneles belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the dirt and the noise of animals.
An antidote against the "bird problem" is not yet in view.
When the first ostfriesisch symposium on the cornells, experts said it was no longer possible to hunt the city’s streams.
Experts across Germany have discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature protectors were based on the problems of cities also on the exode of particularly protected fluids: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, arrangement and killing typical cow trees made life difficult for birds.
Cornells are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 cowboy pairs in the westfälischen Soest, northwest of which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative advertising due to the massacre of cornells in the region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourmets.
"The normal expulsion, the event, serves nothing," said Leer's city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destruction of nids by means of water under pressure or defeat trees, often resulting in adverse effects, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr said in Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals go away, the large colonies divide themselves, and they disperse to other places."
It is only imaginable in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement houses or schools.
“We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can’t destroy them anymore.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concebible is a combination of animal swallowing to an averse packaging and adjacent offers, in order to allow them to be reinstalled elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens was prosecuting "information panels instead of trousers" to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can ultimately better support a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-foundered the Ascheberger-chemining-educating baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very smart streams.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: “There is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say.”
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Fress not only use work instruments to reach a regular, but they produce their own tools as work instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge have recently tested four streams, how far birds intelligence arrives.
In an experience, birds quickly learned that they had to scratch a scratch with stones to reach a larva.
Without a lot of training, they determined to recognize that a stone must have some size and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second trial, the tricky cornells then had to solve a more trap problem.
In a cylinder vertically placed, the researchers had placed a small sea with a larve.
The birds couldn’t reach their bucket with their beans.
However, the researchers had put iron wire pieces at their disposal.
All four animals formed a crochet with the help of which they fished the small seal of the small pipe.
Three of the four streams have been successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a hit by the Bosnian and Turkish remained unsuccessful.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland purchased the latest tickets in the 2012 European Championships in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Conducted by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8e, 53e), Portugal fought against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and became perfect, after 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the eliminatory return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first manche (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
There was nothing more burning in the 0:0 match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 release (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72e, 82e) and Miguel Veloso (80e) marked the other shots for Portugal.
The former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11 meters (41e) and Captain Emir Spahic (65e) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted with a yellow-red map (54e).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup eliminators in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Stadium da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a 30-meter free hit in advance in the shirt.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his distance shooting qualities and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City, initiated a head ball directed to the bottom of the cross-border bar, the ball did not cross the target line (33e).
Jiracek shot a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the arbitrator Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during Bosnian Penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow map in Portuguese (36e).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a 11-meter punishment played by the controversial hand after Fabio Coentrao's action that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion succeeded in four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champion will be at the EMU for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech’s goalkeeper prevented with a last minute reflection by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic marked at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface just next to the Chech shooting.
After the pause, the crossroads had to come to the help of the Czech world class guard already killed, once again, the attacker of the FC Seoul had been replaced (50e).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey lost Zagreb’s football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to leave his place at the 2002 EM Third Bank, the Croatians were able to enjoy their fourth tour at the end of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the stadium Maksimir, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored at the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the poultry, the attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the target.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn’t let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, which was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62th Minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already supported 4:0 successfully the first step for a preliminary decision, 32th Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) equated for visitors.
Irish hit the highest speed from the start, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that Estonia's defense could prevent a possible goal of the first buffer.
In the 32th minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and would close the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (1,5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centres and employ employees accordingly,” said CEO Bill McDermott to his customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The staff will increase from approximately 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The Killing of Personal Mass
The new book of Peter Englund offers depth and generosity. The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) starts with a long list of characters that close your heart.
One advice to start: carefully scratch this page and make it your page brand.
In this novel story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a mark during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be worried and desperate in the noises of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issued the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote here a book out of the public that he described, with precision, as "a book of anti-history."
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is no embassy or discussion on strategies and hardware.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that “a book describing what this could look like.” There are “emotions, impressions, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and sorrow" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of war, from young schools and botanists to escalators, through doctors, ambulance and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war will lose their members, become crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives go out here like the shells of a church: while some turn off, we gather new ones together.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It brings a decline to the idea that the First World War is only summarized by the terrible war of the tranches on the Western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and Eastern Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are in the streets; a Christmas spending in Egypt under the pyramids; the Tshe-seed mushrooms are an intraitable problem.
This book is excited from the first page.
The war invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a Katrina hurricane that can cord.
When canon strikes resent from the distance, and you are a mother at home, are you staying or fleeing?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been shocked by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, cauchemars and rumors.”
"Beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young naval of the German High Sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memories, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but they are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most people are dealing with privacy and the ability to get out of it.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund wrote: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, rubber imitation, paper bands, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of rice cooked in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; seeds of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meat are registered in the production of sauce. There are also 511 substitute cafes."
Some stories address honor and courage.
A American recognizes his own pulse towards wildlife and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, that's what men were destined to, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a hand whisky, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than claiming that no such barbecue is synonymous.
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that he is very likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When we refuse to sacrifice, we hope to have a public,” he wrote.
It is rather comparable to “a secretly convicted man.”
Other observations relate to the decline in an old Europe and new types of terror.
“The conflict becomes increasingly a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the beast of the beginning of the century: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass killer, in well-cut clothes, who performs his dish while sitting behind a comptoir."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers who have tried to catch a Venice disease at prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the trade of puzzle due to gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and emphasize on genital organs in the hope of ending in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate ones apply it to the eyes, which means a bitterness to life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatory, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captured the way the war "developed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion."
People begin to wonder why their leaders make war for them.
The best works about the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "In the West nothing new," by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a non-conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most fascinating thing I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it’s as if he had appeared from his book, picked up this page from your hands, where the list of people is listed and burned with a flame.
After a first fake step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing anti-heavy casks.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to all other high-ranking officers as well as other informed from the beginning that they were going to perform an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could have been no repetitions of episodes over the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the regulation of the department and caused a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
Police were prepared by watching the course of occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on the island of Randall, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against terrorists - anti-terrorism measures that involve moving a large number of police officers quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the East River side of Manhattan.
The orders given to move to the park were achieved "in the last minute," a customary said, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
“The few police officers I know and who have been called didn’t know they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said in an anonymous statement.
"The only people who know they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the police department."
The city had a lesson, from which the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean the park, but hundreds of protesters informed of the plans were dismissed.
The operation on Tuesday included officers of various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers used to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said many people were going and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so an hour in the morning was a favorable timetable.
"It should be done when the park counts the least of people," he said.
There were vehicles of emergency services equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervention.
The recorded lights and messages retentishing speakers seemed to intimidate the protesters.
While Community affair officers entered the park equipped with their clear blue wind cutting, many demonstrators simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tent was affected before 1 p.m. 45, the police said, leaving the occupants time to gather their business.
Other police teams were observed on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were needed.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, spokeswoman of the police department, said that this measure had been taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from watching the intervention within the park, hardly retained by officers.
Mr. Browne said the trucks of television cameras present on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police were moving to the west through the demonstrators’ business bulb, including luggage, plastic bags and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams of the health department followed, cleaning everything the occupants left behind them.
The few protesters who refused to leave were traced. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of protesters took place near the campsite kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the camp epicenter joined together.
Finally, two people were chained into trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut the chains.
No arrest took place in the park before 3:30 p.m., Mr. Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them are "foreign in public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, is the most ranked officer to have been found on the spot.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of the Detectives Department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "we were not running operations," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police suffered along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades have been placed on Cortlandt Street, a pasta of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street in the south.
We saw the police expanding the perimeter far beyond the Zuccotti park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with bowls, had even been seen pushing people to get them away.
Almost 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
About 5 p.m., in the south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on a police car's headquarters, and others were watching crashing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a bit of counterplaque came up flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The Association of School Aid continues the city for dismissal
The trade unions, which represents hundreds of school aids that lost their employment last month, plans to plan a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory discharges. The impact is disproportionate on schools that host poor schools.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and twenty school aids, parental coordinators and other employees, who were part of the city's less payable, lost their employment on October 7 last. Union leaders compared these dismissals with political revenge because they did not allow the city to access a health care fund led by the workers' groups, and that would have allowed the latter to leave the
The municipal authorities categorically denied this charge.
At a hearing of the Municipal Council last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said the discharges were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that the dismissals of school aid were in no way specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officials said they would fill in a complaint opinion, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce prosecutions to the Supreme Court of Manhattan State.
Dennis Walcott and the city’s education department will represent the defendant party. The complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of them black or of Latin American origin, as most school aids lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman of the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet seen the reasons for the trial and can therefore not make comments on the allegations.
According to a series of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would put on the number of dismissals in the schools in the city's most vulnerable neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to a regular subfinance.
While there is no licensing on Staten Island, and just a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa establishments, 17 school aids have lost their job in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern District of Bronx.
Noteing the loss of five school aids from eight employees at the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68% of schools live in poverty, prosecutions say "This is not a neighborhood of skilled parents who can bring funds to fill budget shortages."
The budget of public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disabled student registration.
The union also claims that high school directors could have been misleading by some terms in a memory authorising the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memory used the term “surpassing” to describe the action, although more generally “surpassing” describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the complaint project, "sixty-six parent coordinators were released", and "not only for oversight".
Mission completed: Congress finds an agreement on the issue of Libya
Finally, it seems that Republicans and Democrats have found an agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of long-standing dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision on Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democracy - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their rebellion and American troops for their "courage".
“This resolution is to honour the courage of the Libyans while they start rebuild their country,” John Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple until now.
This summer, both parties have been in conflict with the White House on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at endorsing the US military role in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution aimed at authorising the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day after the bill failed, the House of Deputies also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the funding of U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress was contrary enough to criticize Obama’s mission management, but not enough to cut herb under his feet.
The independence of Congress has been overwhelmed by the events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20.
NATO mission was officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Committee on Foreign Relations resolution "congratulates the Libyan people for their courage and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their courage and fantastic professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the U.S. national interest in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all the support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as in June last year?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokeswoman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar hadn’t read the latest version of the new project yet.
Within the Capitol, the House has to vote this week for an amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without attempting.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are repeated - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slightly varied from a previous.
At least 15 versions of the House are counted only from the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handpiece that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to do their CV - the chance to boast of being the author of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, approved last August, requested the House and Senate's vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates for which Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democracy - New York) wants to lift the limit of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democracy - Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other things.
An amendment prohibiting marriage between individuals of the same sex is permanently proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to authorise the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the States are opposed to it.
As the Members have been willing to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The rate was slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they had today.
The last amendment to be added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacreed but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a armed man shot him on the end of Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democracy - Arizona) appeared on Monday night in a television broadcast, singing "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said he wanted to return to Congress, rather than return to Congress.
During her appearance in the 20/20 TV newspaper on the ABC channel, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords fought to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The issue approached his difficult return after the ball that broke his head and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote for the text on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and singed - and qualified her recovery as "difficile".
After Diane Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded "more well".
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place at a special edition of an hour of "20/20", broadcast on the evening of the release of the new book of the couple entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show retracted Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the shooting of January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, it was seen on his hospital bed, the head, and a wide bulb on the front.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband’s encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors teach him how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
a movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "Quoi".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords shook another word ("Toast") to ask for a change in her breakfast menu.
ABC’s videos show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords’ recovery: you see the representative singing with physicians Cyndi Lauper’s air “Girls Wanna Have Fun” and Tom Petty’s “Free Fallin”?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours every day with doctors, said he didn’t remember the shooting.
According to his husband, he was reading an article about the shooting on March 12 when she stopped him and asked for the first time information about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, was detained in a prison in Missouri and treated vigorously while waiting for the trial.
“There were many dead,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dur, halt, halt."
When he recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I would say, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been beaten,” Mark Kelly said.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, get back and get back stronger than ever before.
More compassion than respect for the troops
The event: a gala in Wall Street to gather millions of dollars for veterans without home from New York City.
Kid Rock singed a dance on impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors around him.
The crowd dressed in cravate stood at his feet to acclamate him.
"The military, men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds for the spring.
A high-grade military attending the gala, to which also participated Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of the U.S. Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," the military's high degree wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was just compassion.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships between the military and a passionate but often distant American public.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, declare some military.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said the brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way to support us is to close ourselves in the role of evil spirits.”
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders who do not want to seem unthankful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about compassion take place in confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons of the fight with the Navy, the retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service in two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were faced with rebels and traveled to remote lands.
Others would wonder if "a violent and angry veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were making the interviews were subtlely asking if he could be able to hold the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
“When you address the subject of the service, you are facing negative impressions,” says Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise partly from American indifference to wars.
The wins are rarely congratulated by a country that is so unfamiliar with the army and see little direct benefits from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and people are widely focused on the depth of the sufferings of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of endured service periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of injuries.
The army faces the increasing pressure of fighting rape
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will be prosecuted against the army for alleged inaction in rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
The first-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant for 11 weeks at the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She returned to her office at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beer.
He asked if he could come to her in his room to drink a drink.
"C" was a warning signal," Elizabeth Lyman said.
But Texane has left her concern.
I thought, no, he was 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I had to follow my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught her behind, threw her down and raped her.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, will be anxious to wait for the judgment during a historical trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rape within the army, thus opposing the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Claimed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by soldiers colleagues. They also claim that the army has not investigated, prosecuted or supplied after appropriate assault.
Susan Burke says she is taking care of the Galon military, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in position to eradicate the culture of reprisals? The leaders?"
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of which may be part of future judicial proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all complainants in this case - putting all of its eggs in the same basket - it will try several trials, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
Judiciary documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused by armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision by the Supreme Court, named the Doctrine Feres, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by active personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent to the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense refused to make any comments.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is only recorded on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s soldiers teams play an increasingly important role, particularly in contact with local women.
In these two wars, 150 women soldier lost their lives – two-thirds in battle situation.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, Susan Burke said.
She is not alone to carry out this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale's Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Center prepares a case against the four major military academies for encouraging a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, Vietnam's non-profit foundation Veterans of America prepares a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality problems" attributed to victims of rape to give them a relatively common fact, according to women's rights groups such as 'Anu Bhagwaru' of the Service Women's Action Network, a military network of men's actions
His group filed a trial in December to the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the way to deal with claims of benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded from the Department of Defence Center for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. In fact, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred this year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of judicial proceedings: in 2010, 20% of the cases registered in the army were subject to a trial – half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
Susan Burke’s complainants describe their aggression as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat in front of a judge in a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her aggression.
Six people testified as a witness of morality for the criminal, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was made,” Elizabeth Lyman said.
"I thought I was going to start with contractions, and I started shouting after the court."
"I was placed as a psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember saying to my commander, 'This was not his case, but my case.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her inappropriate to service.
In January 2010, it was sent back in terms of less than honorable, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Is the case Lyman and other complainants going forward or not, this is a long history, says John Turley, professor of law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine that has been criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I’ve always criticized Feres’ doctrine.
The army is behind decades because it does not have the same benefits and means of dissuasion imposed by responsibility.
“The chances are severely against them... but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things change only when good people want to fight.
If the trial does not turn to them, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will gather his hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy talking about his online anti-immigration opinions.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted that he was taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Login to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t so difficult to find them back,” said Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report published by the DEMOS Reflexion Group on Digital Populism in Europe.
Facebook is filled with so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find people they are looking for with scientific accuracy – the way marketers do it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. It targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked about their level of education, their attitudes towards violence and their future optimism.
In contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interrogate 10,000 supporters from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries without leaving the office.
“This is a new way to do research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: online supporters of right groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.
The study of DEMOS is only an example of how Facebook has become the new inevitable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, researchers in medicine and polyologists use the site to study all the topics that concern health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I love" publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that on average add three contents per day, the “supernova data” generates a research explosion, increasing the number of research works that the site name appears in the title by nearly 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not approach in the street.
"In the past, when you tried to conduct investigations on the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter,” says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoid all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their embryos were much more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that students colleagues, such as advisors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, says the Washington Post.
“We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not be otherwise unrecognized.”
Facebook is also constantly accessing the information of its users.
The team of the site that cares for data has studied statistics about the loving situation and the day of St. Valentine, the rate of participation in the 2010 mid-mandat elections and a national happiness index ( thanks to only information available - digital freedom champions have long supported that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they have not even heard about?
While researchers have well-defined tips on how to collect information differently than through the Internet, it is something else online.
"I don't believe that a large number of users have already thought that a researcher could study their profile," Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, said in a 2006 study he conducted by watching the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they know, exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without passing through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a note block and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address social aspect - and social, it is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance in the trial held in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Temples,” he explains in a hearing room filled with 500 people.
"With regard to the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't like guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim discontinued Breivik during this monology because he “was not willing to leave him the opportunity to use this process to express his opinions.”
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, to talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for twelve weeks, banned him from talking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present in the audience.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind the bars.
Everyone participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a survivor from Utoya told the Norwegian NRK television channel.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik, dressed in a dark dress and a blue cravate, remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes of entering and leaving the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast “resistance” movement, the judge decided that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with complices.
The 22 July attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the sorrow or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I'd prefer it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," a victim's parent said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview in the Cinema this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared it to Henry Ford - distinguishing itself by the technical engineering and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find more reveal in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will be broadcast this week in the first part of a film on the main markets is how creative this spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was without a doubt a creator and dreamer. He was a hippie but was also very messy and organized, as well as an improver of organograms - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disability conceived let them think that a great idea makes 90% of the work produces a substantial amount of work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series tracks the birth of the computer, and he sat with Steve Jobs for more than an hour for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years ago that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple, already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he says the main copies have disappeared in transport.
Only after Steve Jobs’ death, a full video is found in the garage of the director.
This video, slightly upgraded, is the base of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be broadcast on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate thorough interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions – between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism re-abounds, where he seems to be excited to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him cravings to accelerate it and move to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, a strange aspect of Lost Interview is found. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computers.
It’s one thing to read Steve Jobs’ post-cutting career reviews, but there’s something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxiety dreamer in the evening of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and must be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
About how he learned to manage a business:
“During all these years, I have always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details on his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Surprisingly about how the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed to the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to pirate telephone networks and call free of charge.
The device has been subject to many writings in advance, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an appropriation act is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, switching a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while turning as many satellites as possible.
"We'd beat the ball of different things a half a dozen times and you shouted in the public phone and it came to you a minute later on the public phone next to you," Jobs laughed.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much, but we learned to invent a little thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have existed a day without that.
Steve Jobs continues to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked the Pope to talk.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two companions are laughing crazy just before the Pope himself woke up.
About his love with technology (and the start of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the calendar and takes him a wire.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. C" was the only company I had seen at that age, and this formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer never designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, having a small Catholic tube, I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and began writing programs for this machine.
On Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, while he installs to sell a few printed circuit cards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 credit days, it has to take care of assembly as well as delivery of finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big disputes... I was shouting on it claiming that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Twenty-two days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would seem incredibly reliable.
About the major companies that breathe:
Long before he regained Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Do you admit that you were working at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copywriter or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can evolve, so [this are the types of people] that end up managing companies and product-specialised staff are taken away from decision-making.
The engineering in the product that has led to this monopoly position is completely ruined by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have made its current size ten times. Xerox would have been Microsoft in the 90s...
They defeated the victory.
About innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a great idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories as well.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them to each other.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is to try to expose you to the best products that humans have created, and to try to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso said one day that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed of stealing excellent ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. People who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health law opponents while the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court met closed to examine the issue of political discord, namely whether the opposition to President Obama’s Health Act will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted at a dinner held by the lawyers’ office that will defend the case before the Supreme Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved was a 26-state trial against the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that was a relief point for conservative militants at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March next, and the result will likely be of nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full rise at the time the court’s decision will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue about the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. general appealer during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s legal cabinet, PLLC Bancroft, has been one of the two dozen cabinets that have helped in the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-term group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another dinner agency, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that contested the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who has a huge financial issue in the result of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate’s top Republican and the stated opponent of the Health Law.
Did the guests have dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of deontology.
In fact, judges are exempt from code of conduct which governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend collections of funds of law-related organizations and other although the judge may not be an intervener, an honourable guest, or listed in the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the lawyers’ offices of the case, as well as a company with massive financial interests, was sufficient to alarm government ethic activists.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a collection of gala funds with lawyers who have cases in court."
Their presence and participation in the collection of funds of this event demonstrate any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little respect for critics claiming they are too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative militant.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethics, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general advocate for the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the first-instance court level.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that she would do it.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for online aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-colour airplanes, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary for a company to receive an order containing 50 of its products.
It is, on the contrary, a whole case when the company is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Also incredible is from who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a gold mine growing in future aircraft orders.
According to forecasts published on Monday, Chicago’s airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2 520 aircraft in the next 20 years, worth a total of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in his history – 50 Boeing 777 bi-colours.
It is the airline Emirates based in Dubai that made this faraon order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aeronautical Salon that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, Dreamliners, a model that flatters significant fuel savings and convenience for passengers.
The amount of these six devices amounts to more than one billion dollars.
"It is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers particularly have an enormous value."
In the Middle East, oil producers have many of their airlines.
Therefore, they have not only the means of paying these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines as it represents their biggest costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely to cancel or disrupt aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural risk cover,” he said.
The command of Emirates strengthens Boeing’s predominantity on the wholesale carrier aircraft market and helps stop the Airbus competitor’s attempt to start with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautics salon arrives four months after Airbus announced the start of the largest version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus rebuilds its starts to increase its rise as a result of the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to reach $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President manifestly struck in the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug dealers have helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race as governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seemed to have lost her attempt to access Michoacán's rulerships during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug dealers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was head of the race to the governor position of that Western State.
"The intervention of the crime organized during the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our electorate agents... they took up urnes, installed road bars... and forced people to vote for the PRI."
The PRI ruled Mexico for sixty-two years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seemed to have noticed only a few of Calderon, who was head of polls before the day of the elections.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently occupies the roles of governor, has arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any connection with drug dealers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
The Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine trafficking.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traders in December 2006.
Nevertheless, violence has persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was murdered while he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections seemed, a victory will help the party in its elan.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare for the euro area to get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, CEO of the BASD based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world should "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "individual eye" and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term global economy collapse.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected up to a certain point, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, nothing will prevent them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously crushed by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has been dangerously risen and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has led to the fear that the world economy will not return to recession, and has raised the call for the major emerging economies to gather to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag claimed that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also stated that this bilateral aid - such as buying the obligations of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offers greater negotiations power to Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce and Industry of India, said that "India will do everything it can to help the euro area because its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital revenue.
“No one wants the euro area to remain instability and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to address and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“This is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 a day, or less.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks are retired at 50 years old and that they go on vacation in the sun and they will be harmful to evaporate it,” he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to maintain many well paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area crisis would risk "significant impacts" across Asia.
BASD forecasts of a 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now face “the risks of loss” due to European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets had to develop "save plans" to protect themselves from economic returns and significant capital escapes.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions would know national security, and it triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan's battlefields through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already deducts $450 billion for the next decade, but now fears that an additional amount of $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the failure of Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would lead to 23% reduction as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“A significant reduction, which is thus applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects impossible – you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously affect other modernisation efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on vacation without wages to achieve the goal."
“These changes would ruin the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
Reductions would potentially affect the fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of contingence operations abroad is not directly affected by sequel, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta said.
“The contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting war.”
"Salary management staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
“The consequences of a seizure on the Defence Department would trigger a rapid decline in the United States as a global leader in question of military power.”
"We are threateningly opposed to this draconic action," the senators said in a communal statement on Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta's letter.
“This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not that we should impose ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it should not have to occur.”
Whether Panetta's letter and senators' recent warnings increase the pressure for a budgetary compromise or call for the Pentagon to exempt reduction, we still see.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the highest position of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Secretary painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a coquilla, but not a core.
"It's a ship without seafarers."
"It's a ballless brigade."
"It's a hunting plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of housekeepers, buildings, and bombs that have not enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his preliminary observations at the Pentagon.
“It is a depressed, poorly prepared and unable to face potential opponents.”
"In fact, she invites to aggression."
In an addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the greatest defence projects could move to the cutter, including those already tested and some just at the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new land vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the Army and Navy.
Ending the F35 development and trials could generate $80 billion savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
An overview of recent shirts indicates how falsehood and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
The Republican candidate to the presidency Herman Cain is busy to exchange allegations of sexual harassment with several women, each side accusing each other of lying.
The Penn State administrators were accused of having allegedly covered reports that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested by an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lies destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congress member Anthony Weiner and the celebrity of the Internet passed for an idiot by promptly issued denial contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of financing campaigns related to coverage of extramarriage.
And then, none of those who have lived the history will never forget the media circle that President Bill Clinton triggered while lying in his second mandate on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The trickery stories at school and university tests are legion.
There were cases where teachers gave the test responses to students to see their performance assessments well.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and trickery are acceptable.
How much fraud will we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are godly lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential competence that everyone must acquire for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let’s say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I have you", the detection of fraud is a serious branch of scientific knowledge based on data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted deep research on such projects, including in psychology and physics.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths on lies have been demystified.
The liars look at you in their eyes.
They don’t beat, red, or they don’t always beat.
Don’t conclude that liars are difficult to detect and hard to mask.
A qualified lies detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the time of response.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerged knowledge of fraud, and it is clear that detection of fraud is a modern competence that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include employment, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are capable of reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know, according to research, that extravertisers lie more than introvertis, that men say more "centric on them" while women say more "centric on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but that the lies they tend to be told is less common).
We know that if you are considered a disbelievers, the others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "state reference data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure subsequent changes.
Watch the position of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally turns his feet permanently so that you don’t throw unfair charges when you see him turning his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for evidence of verbal and non-verbal false behaviors.
Consider these indices as red flags, not evidence of fraud.
Fool people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, turn towards an exit, change position in a significant way, or present a relief of "post-interview" - an excessive relief, a change of position when all difficult questions have passed.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson took off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national research to find her back.
Fool individuals can also use a remote language: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question completely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" in his answer to a difficult question: "Well... to say the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptible rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magical formula for detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize fraud is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid victimization by arnakers in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oil pipeline plan will be defeated after the threat of U.S. late approval
A few days after Obama’s administration threatened to delay the approval of an oil pipe project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico – stimulating the anger of trade unions while calming environmentalists – the company seeking to build the oil pipe says it is ready to redirect the project to return them.
TransCanada said Monday evening she will move the projected pipeline outside the environmentally sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada’s officer Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will finally get the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new potential route studies to avoid the areas of the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala, from vast water sources.
“It’s a real way forward,” said Lee Terry, a Nebraska republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department would likely have revoked any decision by 2013, after the next year's elections, although officials denied the involvement of policy in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil pipe would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the Alberta province to the refineries of Texas.
In order to do this, he must cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have placed on the 20,000 estimated jobs related to oil pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan press that a law for forced the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala acquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The ongoing environmental impact study of the State Department found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the Ministry's Inspector-General ordered a separate investigation of the examination process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist engaged by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit fear
A New York family claims that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva launched in a chain of violence in their Manhattan building hall, terrorized their little daughter as she was scared of it.
The shooting of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk, to the extent that she had "changed personality, sleep disorders" and "the increased fear of foreigners," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year, while scene technician Kevin Monk, his child garden teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the hall of their boulevard Riverside building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and placed her daughter for a moment.
"Whoever came behind me and said to me, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and I went to pick her up.'
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She told me about an aggressive tone: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I said to him, 'What you say or think you don't care about me.'
She became enchanted and began using jurors - the word "" and word "" of a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and began to wash me from the bottle of water.
She said at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look at what you have done to my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on her mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be kept by her surroundings who trained her to a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she began to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for excuses from LaBelle, but did not get any answers.
Lawyers and LaBelle’s representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unprecedented damage, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and the family plans to do all the money received to a child’s cancer charity work.
"The goal is to keep Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a maternal teacher carrying a 18-month child.”
Climate Adversity Breaks the Economy
During Mario López Valdez’s first year of management, unemployment and informality increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations in terms of the economic advances, but due to the major climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed by the indicators of the exchange therein.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, have limited the possibilities of the state's economy for growth, resulted in a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the economic decline in the historic sector by 31.16 per cent in the agriculture sector, which affected the
According to the Mexican Rural Development Sustainable Council report, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, 78.03 per cent of which suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, and the main crops were damaged.
The decline in economic activity generated, by November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, by the state's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year, by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, by 74 percent of the state's unemployment rate, by the average increase of the year, by the average increase of the year, by the year.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactory, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on actions carried out by public policy.
“What is observed is an increase in unemployment due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the law approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in a illegal way it is not easy to use something that they invest in, and they choose to win them.”
Immigration detained
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to work abroad has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry, and second because they already have many difficulties to find work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is worsening considering the high level of serious lack that prevalent among labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in this state is working there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
In addition to unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for delay for the state is the low wages, the entity has the lower wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Labour and Social Forecast Secretariat.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, up to September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which is 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contracting of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction in the Stranger Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretary of Economy of the State, last year the IED reached $630 thousand 697, which represents a decrease of $87.74 percent in the same year compared to $14 million.
In turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 billion pesos per year, mainly registered by third-party companies.
Leave this
Given the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested the public congress in July the approval of a 3 billion peso credit, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of the economy not to reactive the economy, the approval of the congress to the state was 2,600 billion pesos.
Reactions
For employers, the first year of Mario López Valdés Government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
“The performance of Sinaloa’s economy during this year has really been very poor, we need to work intensely to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all, and especially the right running already synchronized with this new government team, hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic Leather
Loredo López said events like ice cream at the beginning of the year have kept the state economy and have restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced from several events, including ice cream, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not rotate fast enough to generate economic dynamics that enables us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year, we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefinition of vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, the President of the Central Confederation of the Republic of Sinaloa said we want to channel the state towards more productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that re-defines the vocation and economic direction of the state, as it is important to denote the entire potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of the Coparmex emphasized the importance of establishing a future vision that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in the governance of public policy.
“There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still a lot to do,” he said.
Condemned for 8 pounds of marijuana
One person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The General Parket of the Republic informed that the convicted little trader is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in its variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in the street Cipriano Valdez, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trader circulated in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle’s luggage, and on the place of the pilot a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements have been made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted is still in the Center for Legal Consequences of Crimes Execution.
Debt to contributions to works
Works of social character in programs such as Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants may not be completed where recording serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although the construction programmes have progressed so far, they are in a risk situation as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions exceeding 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
In total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State has to provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, so there is a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they did not give us anything, even though since July they had to give us part of it," he said, "and we, to not register delays, started the books and did a lot of progress, but we need money."
He noted that last year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had already undergone this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to work, and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that the State authorities have committed to providing these resources, he said they had made the request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to supply almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the "analogic cutting" in Mexico in 2015
Substitution of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) raised the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogical cope" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to disable it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his assignments when he issued the decree which details the actions to follow to implement the transition to earthly digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been introduced for failing to reach the qualified majority of eight votes in order for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because radio and television regulations are a law-reserved award to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies in contesting the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided for for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also resolved to address the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the draft of which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his intervention, the President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure measures through general standards to prepare the public administration for it.
"I also consider it only if it was done to affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, who has the constitutional mandate of the state's leadership.
Substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years, and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To update the change, he said, would be to add the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because this also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "requires the operation of a whole system established, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, covers a group of assignments that the Constitution confers on the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries all over the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, issued the controversial decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of Congress in a form, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative.
An analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to PREP data, the difference between the first and second position of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total trials.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" calculation is a reality regarding the election trial this year in Michoacán, where, according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between the first and second position of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without accounting the 8 percent of the respective votes79.
In this regard, the Chairman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, November 9th, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonise local standards for the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve either his Political Constitution or his Electoral Code of State or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the ending of the legal deadline so that this electoral process could enter into force, and the objection of some of the Electoral Law that the Governor of the State, Leonel Godoy Offel, had passed them in its publication deadline.
On the same 9th November, the Supreme Court of the National Justice (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the Local Legislative Power and referred to as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate for constitutional reforms, as it does not have the right to "sanction or contest them".
Interviewed with the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal stated that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council, partial and total votes will be possible by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial number of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the verbal proceedings do not coincide; there is no verbal votes and there is no verbal votes in the case of the urn; or there are errors or alterations of the prosecutions.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all the election urnes may be achieved when there is an index that the difference between the candidate assumed to win the respective election and the candidate who won the second position in the election is equal or below a second percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session the candidate represented the second party has expressed the petition.
The total calculation of the voting can also be achieved if at the end of the common calculation it results that the difference between the winning candidate and the second position is equal or lower to a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition of the representative of the political party whose candidate has come out second, in which the partition of the elections is excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation in the election of Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second position is only 0.16 percent, even without accounting the votes of 129 of the 923 total trials.
His last will
Its cedars will be spread into Zapalinamé's siera, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his native town, on Sunday to night, and on Monday people will present their honours and there will be a rest misses.
According to his family, the last will of Lieutenant Colonel was that his cedars were spread into Zapalinamé's serra.

Felipe Bacio Cortés abandoned the town of Saltillo to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had a truck malfunction; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the opportunity he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was seven, he traveled to Zapopán for his family’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle is dying by doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
His last goodbye
With honour, he said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, honour that headed by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, where the Techlloology study has as a director in 1985, the Mexican Army has as a sport, through the Sixth Zone of the Mexican Air Force, and the Force

Three abandoned bodies located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before it was found, the military authority had submitted the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by fire shot in different parts of the body and with grace, in a abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed through this place noticed that in the property, whose closing has beige and coffee color the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, at about three meters, they localized the bodies of three people, and they immediately informed the relevant authorities about it.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with bretelles.
A meter away there was the body of another person with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
The three were extended to the stomach.
According to data collected in situ, the three people had been murdered elsewhere, because no in situ dolls were found.
In the closure of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crimes towards the other, except for a few ball holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence made the presentation of 11 people, including a minor, who was part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to have relationships with sequestrations, murders, "halconeo" (monitoring) and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information published, on November 11, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros colony and they managed to save one who had been freed from freedom.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cellular; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "The Zetas".

By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00 a.m. one of his companions was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Nominated Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the edge of the economic disaster
The nominated Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the edge of the economic disaster and has threatened the entire Eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed of technocrates in the majority, even if it is unclear when the new executive will take his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to overcome this difficult phase,” the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the ton of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
“The frame is now well traced,” he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a time less than usual, while Italy struggles with a political and financial crisis that has raised its debt costs at impossible levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve a hard package of austerity required by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Strengthening the pressure on Monti to speed up, the instability of the markets to place the return of Italian BTP bonds 10 years above 7%, the level in which Greece and Ireland were saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: “We have said we will support this government a lot.”
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were significantly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the right center party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating financial market attack.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti started its consultations with political parties, trade unions and working groups and youth and women organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who has authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief repetition at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the cost of Italian debt now came back to critical levels between the uncertainty of the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1,9 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his government should continue until the future elections, planned for 2013, despite the generalized predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections advance.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the major parties insist on the fact that this should be trained only by specialists, an index of their objections to a process required by financial pressure.
Political sources reported that mutual disagreements and disagreements between the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spanish is higher than that of the Costa Ricans
Of 22 footballers called Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked attended 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convoked by both countries for today’s friendship at 15:05, at the National Stade of San José.
While national and European champions, the number one of FIFA’s monthly ranking, account a wide record of inter-selected A-class games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Star League and in powerful clubs of the First League of England maintain intense activities each year in national league and coupe championships and disputes in European coupes such as the Champions League.
All this needs to be added to the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminators of the European Cup and the World Cup of Football.
In contrast, Costa Rican footballers have a limited international experience to a zone, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the largest record of the Spanish selection is that of the target guard Íker Casillas, who on Saturday earlier against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of former target guard Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a Barcelona brain driver, in the 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized last week by UEFA alongside the other hundreds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the Schalke front center, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is ready for the centenary, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences, and the brush Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five overcame the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even happen at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only has one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The historic buffer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 mosquitoes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts on the National Stade next Sunday.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream to come true in this country.
It is that bassist and founder member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively to Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two decades of work celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its unique scale in Central America.
This day will be presented at the National Stade, from 19:30 a.m., next to the Los Angeles X group and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an extract from the conversation, whose full transcription is found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality. Are you aware of what your fans live?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holiday; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So that makes us feel like wearing our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, fans live intensely in previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent adherents?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
It took 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we're sorry that so much time had to be spent until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have offered in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has formed us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to make surfing; this is how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been produced there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and different directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this due to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we haven’t been interpreted for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reason we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes even more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe everything you have succeeded?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined we were going to form a big rock group, and the fact that we have done it for more than 20 years makes it a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to do music together makes us feel a lot.
We love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been a honour for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups go out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we’re lucky to be still friends with all of them and it’s a honour to be part of this Seattle sound that has emerged.
It is also very strange that a group like yours holds together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is a lot more time than many groups normally.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and second of all, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are music boulevards that give freedom to everybody to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and that couldn’t go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity was not easy; however, thanks to your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to fall into this game by large crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are here for music, it helps us to forget that we need to respect music and what brought it, without minding the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which really doesn’t care for any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written good songs and at first it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not published a record before Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of frustrations for the fact that she lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think to the incredible person that Andy was laughing, and how it did me laughing, it was a lot of other things.
He was a surprise human and we miss him.
The Las Robertas National Group will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose it for the opening?
Yes, production has sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we loved most, so we are looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very distractive.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He is the one who sings it, and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I can talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the grunge in spite of the fact that this is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little unconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if this is relevant now, I think it is wonderful, because it is a music that is worth listening, and groups like Mudhoney now do the best music than ever.
Initially, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even though these can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them, and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there is trauma in your life and you lose a family or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and these songs, probably represent it for me.
I also think you can be happy, and even as you can do dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical exams
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength he has in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, a 72-year-old, who purified a 25-year prison sentence for violations of human rights during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various affections, including a language cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to gain the benefit of punishment for humanitarian reasons, he probably said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney calculations, blood pressure, and problems of circulation in the feet, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people for an army's abolition escadron that was acting illegally during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and patrons, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper to the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident that took place with France when the French spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community the remaining tax paradise, a statement causing the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to the European country.
Since November, Mexico has presided over the G20, a group of stronger emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to accelerate the implementation of tax exchange agreements to come out of the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) that has increased trade in goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plombier moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought, infamous, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the griffs of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at the stores of everyone, was designed from the beginning to well exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character that must say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Omar Álvarez, a special press officer in Spain, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support" because so far successes like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokeswoman said that despite being in 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a “accessible” video game that allows a quick and fluid game.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at the level of the game, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the different challenges and "suck up optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario incursion also assumes the return of the character to a mobile console, which hasn’t happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the fans of the saga and repeats the formula for success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu plombier must run through the mined platforms to release Princess Peach.
Even if I find new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in Luigi's "playable".
Colom Gives Aval to Portillo Expatriation to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the whitening of $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends in order that Guatemala responds to the request of the country of the north who claimed Portillo to judge it.
In a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision obeyed the independence of the judicial and executive power, taking into account the fact that a first-instance court had already ordered its extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given course to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extracted for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extracted for drug trafficking.
What Colom did assumes a executive approach after exterminating all judicial and constitutional courts to judge the former mandate of the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extracted after resolving its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was absolutely dismissed by Q120 million funds at the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactived the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a risk situation
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is added to the long hundred years of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The birthday served yesterday to make the balance in an act celebrated in an ancient industrial complex in Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are untrained, unemployed, with narcotics or marginalized problems.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the entire election season, showed the unity of Trinijove’s work.
As president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the act by former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor deputy of the Mayor and current eco-socialist municipal adviser Ricard Goma.
Also attended in the big Hall of Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director-General of charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that is also present, but he added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The President gave Trinijove as an example to learn to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-feeds, evacuated
Invaders were suitable for 11 of the building's 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at midnight without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the cauchemar that the residents of the 51th Balmes Street lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupied and where they organized microfees that desperately desperately desperately the neighbours, in court order and without a police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating itself.
“From this day there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the electrical installation and a portion of the water, except painting the walls and leaving residues of any kind, especially alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which would last up to two days and desperately desperately the renters.
Beside the building there is a discoteca, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, has explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building her business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the discoteque mentioned that the owners of the property made him unfaithful because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discoteque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreation room had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for noise, while, according to this, the troubles were not caused by the guests of the discotheque, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially the participants of the holidays organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighborhood area.
The director of the discoteque explained that the troubles were so big that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months ago that this man "forgave" him to rent it.
The Urbana Guardia (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbors for this situation.
President of the municipal group of the PP of the Mayor, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common life and civilization that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that “it must end with impunity and be implacable against anti-social behavior generated in property.”
Yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 a.m., the police moved to Rue Mont-ral's 35th, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had noticed that four people had accessed the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coherent with the opportunity of calling beyond the issue on honorary
The 16-door municipal competition opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, in full support of the already-absent Barcelona Metropolitaine Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed Collserola promotional displays.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great metropolitan park of Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper boundary of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one not focusing on the north-south axis, otherwise above (montagne) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park or Yellowstone, with sandwiches in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called for a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for all access doors in Collserola.
A door returns to the idea of the park, no doubt.
It is this, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appeared alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a conversation theme of all Barcelona architects.
This is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this old elephant castle speak when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions that coincide with three Barcelona architects, university professors, who presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is appropriate.
For Roldán, after approaching the literary front "it is necessary" to discuss "the front of the mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green house pastes, has not been finalized.
“We need to leave the base that the most extensive park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, the architect gave the verdict for which the title of the "Ports of Collserola" enclosed a "lexical loop": one should not think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers arising from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which had occurred in the area of the Forum "song of cygnes".
The first fear is the delimitation of the boundaries on which we can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” i.e., its overwhelmingness.
“Next urbanistic instruments, planning instruments must be considered, because current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters.”
More on the question, Modol believes that by simplifying the versant from the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by Collserola’s Patronate who “is not to be lost,” thanks for the opportunity that the mayor offers its corporation to intervene in this project “from the first moment”.
In addition, he hears that the proximity to the mountain with the city is the only thing that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" if this technical profile must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success") that one has to create: "We, architects, we should only be an instrument."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question given the title of this piece is complex, because the bases of the competition lack an overall vision of Collserola: “We have called 16 cross-border competitions in the sense of mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and comprises the area as a whole.”
At least in this case, he decided to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors to be shocked in the program and definition with that of the neighbouring door architect.
In its opinion, yes, the Mayor should ensure that immediately higher than that of Dalt's Ronda band should, in its entirety, provide an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this will be released
After 72 days of temporary arrest, the Red Casino’s legal power founder granted forgiveness to the brother of Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged chantages
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of the Red Casino grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, following a challenging trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the assault at the Royal Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás presumably required him to pay a budget so that the Mayor of Monterrey allows the secret functioning of the game house.
After the public declaration, the Parquet opened a criminal trial against the brother of the Mayor PANiste and on September 2 he was arrested and kept in interim arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Agent of the Ministry of Heritage Crimes 3 he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old Quarter of the State Capital.
It remained there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was pronounced after the Officer of the Public Ministry initiated the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta Penal Center presumably for making the owners of the Red Casino sing with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the mid-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capturing order was issued by the District’s Second Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Yanez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation there were sufficient evidence confirmed to determine Jonas’s guilt, such as that of the fall of 1.5 million pesos by the representatives of the gaming house in exchange to allow it to function.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Red Casino, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, presented himself before Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize for the brother of the Mayor of the region; hence he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Ministry officer Ramiro Arias questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who had been associated with the gaming house was the one who had granted the forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Under the case 197/2011, the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonas Larrazábal and no claims regarding the trial against him may be filed; no damages and no penalty will be requested.
After the hearing of the founded legal power of the game house, at 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón’s immediate freedom was ordered.
Jorge Yanez moved to the prison of the San Nicolás municipality of los Garza to report to Jonas that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome communicates the details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake, and seven others have lost their lives.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results highlighted on the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter has hit the ground directly in full structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, noted that before the departure of the aircraft, the pilot found that weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the soil, the pales had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the gun."
He also informed the fact that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it meets the necessary requirements for the transportation of staff.
In addition, he said that investigations made in the impact zone do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a research, we reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was structurally shown.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements for transporting them.
The soil had a pant of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, even one year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, has assured that at the time of the impact, the Mayor of the Presidency State helicopter was operating in speed to cruise and that happened on an ascending ground.
“This information supports the assumption of normal operation cruise at the time of impact,” he said.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical norm, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for delay, and as the aircraft progressed towards the nearby area between DF and the state of Mexico there were low-altitude nebulosis layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that, due to nebulosis conditions, the crew has searched for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the latest recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight route.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available so far allows you to assume that the impact has occurred on a straight and side pathway.
The dispersion model of the remains of the aircraft allows to assume that the helicopter has hit the soil under structural integrity conditions.
There was no detection of fire or explosion traces:
In the place of the accident there is always no trace in the rest of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicated that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the soil.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the soil had a pent that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disconnected along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the soil.
After thorough search in a wider area than the circled place, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, supporting the assumption that the impact took place under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance conducts an investigation to discover the gen of obesity in children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it conducted an investigation to discover the gen of obesity in children and young people, called the protocol ‘Genetics of obesity for children and adolescents’, which will allow the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialities of the 20th century Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research invites the people who are entitled to participate in the sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where proofs for minors are performed every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began at the Cuauhtémoc Sportive Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place at the Sportive Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue at the Sportive Unit Independencia (South of the Federal District) and finally at the Sportive Unit Morelos (North of the Federal District).
He explained that the objective of this research and its knowledge of the components and importance of genetics regarding the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As will be celebrated on 14 November on the World Diabetes Day, he noted that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific nutritional questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family heritage history of their diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, all participants of the anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (seeing to identify people associated with infant obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of healthcare professionals’ concern about the alarming weight gain in minors.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years, in the case of boys, a 77 per cent increase in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; overweight, a dramatic increase was also observed," the IMSS specialist said.
He stated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from the other from its genetic history.
On average, Mexicans have 65 percent of Indo-American inheritance, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity resulted in the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which deposes itself in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the complete assessment of children, allowing them to detect whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
It even said that the presence of dark color plaques (acanthosis) on the neck and the front-bras indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic and even pre-diabetes alterations.
The information is managed confidentially, doctors give it in writing to parents, to which each is explained the measures and changes in lifestyle they have to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three major components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic disorders: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugar beverages, carbohydrates (tames - meat to corn milk wrapped in leaves of corn -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt will avoid cassettes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better efficiency, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rain season in the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the UNAM Chemistry Faculty (FQ), who fully assured that if the construction and maintenance of the pavement would be appropriate, even if the bitumineus were reduced.
A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory responsible for developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimates that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, like some of the northern cities of the country, to improve efficiency, and therefore, the formation of cassettes.
He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a more heavier molecular weight, called asphaltene, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthene, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes crushed.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental and temperature conditions, the chemical engineering specialist warns.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in the majority were covered by a flexible pavement, consisting of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small asphalt bathstones and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he reported, is bathed with asphalt.
When vehicles pass there by generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well into the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bagged in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Since the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material of which it is made must be cared.
Climate, particularly moisture and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, particularly water, as these significantly affect the efficiency of the asphalt layer.
When the soil wets, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult to remove this, which ramps all the layers of the pavement and thus causes cassis.
In the process of formation of a cassis, he says, the first that breaks is the rolling film and only later affects the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated with the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of cassette and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent load of cassette formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bitumine emulsions, which already exist on the market in other countries and allow for repair of cassettes easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What missed Valle's candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna do not get Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle receives her title number 14 of princess.
Again, Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win Miss Colombia's crown.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to satisfy the fact that she was on the podium of the winner, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was raised with the crown and the sceptre, the department summed already 14 titles of Princess and Melina (19su) Alsua (19 Gluca), Alsua (19 Gluca) in a women's legion (19 Alsua del Cauca), Alsua (19 Alena) (19 Alena) (19 Alena) but have been pronounced (19 Alena), Alena (19 Alena) but Alena (19 Alena) but Alena (19 Alena) but Alena (19 Alena) but Alena (19 Alena, Alena), Alena), Alena.
The big question that many people ask today is:
What was missing? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in every presentation she has proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been chosen in vain Queen of the Police and Best Visage Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by the Taliana Queens of Varrona s and Natalia Navarro
The first factor considered key in the decision by the jury to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince her with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posted by Martín Murillo Gómez, Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of Valle’s candidate to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a way to culture myself, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is “The Little Prince” is a quite deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Chastiment" is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Arrow of Blood".
This answer did not please first because of the term "cultured" and secondly to not explain in concrete way each book cited it had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and the wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions launched is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A Bogota journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the Ovtion and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster’s gastronomy challenge, the public’s vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), “it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that’s not why she brillied on that.”
And this was noted in his first presentation in a bathroom shirt at Hilton Beach and his two showcases of the crowning night.
Although the two prophecies seemed to be sure of herself, it was noted that she had the power and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the RCN channel "Come in Casa" (as at home), said that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most of the awards during the competition does not receive the Queen's crown."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and this was a mistake.
Another assumption is that Valle has failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That’s why two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of his country.
“Only the beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, you need to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition starts, they are already involved in projects,” she said.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned by his back defects and the fibrosis observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury has chosen him as the 'Natural Beauty' candidate with the healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Hernán Orozco, the queen-preparator, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admitted that Melina had no best body, that there was better, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in fact for me wasn't too famous, left him points the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine considers that Valle’s candidate’s error was the surgical intervention she had undergone.
"The surgery is good, but Valle hasn't been able to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition for the first time gave back, after the shower in the bath shirt came up with a cruel prediction that took place last night, it was said that it was a small gift Raymundo made to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, or as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition.
However, she will pass in history as one of the queens who, despite her glowing passing through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
This was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
Cali's dactyloscopist passed into history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
Last November, a dactyloscopist of Cali’s ITI passed into history as the person who confirmed the identity of Farc’s supreme leader: “Alfonso Cano”, confronting his fingerprints.
Of seven dactyloscopists working in the local offices of the ITI, this week was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the bumps and feet.
During the week of the Alfonso Cano alliance operation, Eliazar had been warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a helicopter in Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and was suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the research team in the place of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical aspect, because this was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no barbecue, he was dressed like a farmer in the area, without glasses and much more smoother.
But the fingerprints don’t lie.
Along with a Galtonian wolf, ink, a prey and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the map.
His eyes did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, the man originating in Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the Farc supreme leader.
Looking for fingerprints
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopie is an accurate, without error, science, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as stealing and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false identity cards or have no documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher stated that in a case of theft he had to remove a portion of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had pushed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and silver.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to pull a fingerprint, but in this case we could get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in various flights,” he said.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in case of murder.
Recently, a man was found dead, with bottles of drink around him.
By means of the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and actually a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the killer, this is the place on the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reactors are extracted."
When they appear, one uses a pickup or a band to pick up them.
Subsequently, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the data base of the decreasing, or to the Civil Registry National.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," the ITI expert said.
He explained that everything is not how we show in the CSI TV program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything that touches does not become a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is realized.
"Independent" challenges authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters moved in front of the Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Most of the people went to the evacuation order and moved to a neighbouring park.
The members of the Wall Street Occupation movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where they were evacuated in the afternoon and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters moved in front of the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access by a judicial order allowing the "invaded" to camp again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a more northern park in the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the place, we will be settled in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman of the Occupe Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "inmates" to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'indigenous' occupied a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street centrales and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which units New York and New Jersey, the property of the Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray couldn't confirm the concrete figure, ensuring Efe that he saw a few journalists to whom we had also passed out.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved as a sign of support for the members of the movement and has attempted to intervene in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place - which is a private property - remains closed until the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled on Tuesday, during which we must analyze the legality of this morning evacuation.
Some displaced protesters carried and distributed copies of the court order at that time, and they even delivered it to the agents who watched the place, causing “some small confrontations,” Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply "laws published after the start of the occupation or to prohibit protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg stated before the press that, due to this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and to the protesters, but he warned that local laws did not allow them to relocate with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal adviser personally defended the evacuation carried out in the afternoon at Zuccotti place, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided due to the fact that the protesters violated the law.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops had received threats" and the residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning at lunchtime has been rejected and demonstrated that Bloomberg at the bottom is more interested in defending financial interests than those of American workers," said the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
The officials of Occupe Wall Street also reported that they do not think to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be Virgin Marie in a special television program for Christmas
Beside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now, the actress and model will be Virgin Marie in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Marie.
CTV has today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widespread broadcast on the Internet of a private porn video in which she appeared with her husband at that time, the "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed like the Virgin Mary, supporting a puppy that represents Jesus in a crash.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently presented a part of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
Beside Anderson and Peters, the special program of CTV Christmas also presents Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian ‘pute’ during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Renaissance After Earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and ends the decline spiral in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, conquering yet after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the country’s worst disaster since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a hit that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have decreased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the gross domestic product data from July to September used to definitively turn the page: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in an annualized rate.
As recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year starts in March 2012 - additionally assumes the largest rise rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore the devastated areas of the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies have increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decline of 0.9% of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of non-interrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – infrastructure, to use deficiencies to believe zero.
Japan woke up mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
It's the stigma you're
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the nippon currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors who fled the euro zone debt crisis and the US predictive disturbances, a privilege that weighs as a sheet in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic flood line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, accounted for their low results between July and September of the yen.
While markets continue their seats in EU peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not reduce the guard.
“We need to follow the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” state secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And in fact, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of Member States presented clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflation points of the world economy has emphasized that the main powers are braked.
For this one dropped four decimals up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 points in eight.
The Eurozone was even below the average, which is at Level 100, not falling eight decimals to 99.13 points.
Athens nourishes doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the driven peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to embrace the labyrinth that leads to the outbreak of the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by the real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there was no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period set in his appointment could be short for applying them, the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would make sure that she would not support new elections February 19 if she would not have to support the new measures for her departure in any case.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a trusted vote for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to foster employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiative.
However, Samaras’ message does not raise doubts about his position: “We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we are not committed to anything else.”
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his poultry than the EU and IMF, the organizations that have to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently require, and clearly said he will not approve any letter of commitment to adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the entire Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the assistance if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties do not sign a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible.
The spokesman for Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return to Athens "very quickly" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth string" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes Spain's "preponderant" place in this type of finance
Spain has reached a world-wide preponderous place in the role of Microfinance.
Queen Sofia has recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" resides in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen opened yesterday the V World Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very peaceful, in particular, in the one that is aimed at reducing the revenue to half the volume of the United Nations."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that initiatives and contributions originated during the summit, which will extend main women mostly to Thursday, " guarantee the creation of new capacity and poverty for those better opportunities."
We have "acquired a lot of goals" and "we are facing a lot of challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which we need to impulse “two basic goals”.
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of millions of those families are out of the poverty threshold in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneer manner" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofia as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work she knew 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know her loan policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated at Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of the "family leader" meetings "of Valladolid.
Finally, Queen Sofía ended its intervention by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, it said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredits to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work under solidarity criteria and not allow it to be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded “the success” of giving “confidence” to people “excluding to whom everyone closes the door”; and Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed people present in a city that “opends its contaminated doors of solidarity”.
CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the programme, but it was imposed in autumn, particularly to satisfy the militants who consider the government's policy too laxist towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion for the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted by almost unanimity.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstened.
The standing of several minutes on which Angela Merkel was entitled, following their interventions, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very europhilic finance minister, left no place in doubt.
The Chancellor's-master idea - and motion - holds a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs directly depend on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time came from a trace in Europe.”
This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the jealousy is placed.
Similarly, delegates have rejected the proposal of a tremendous majority to weigh the weight of each country to the European Central Bank's management based on the weight of each economy, which obviously would again increase the weight of Germany.
Interestingly to calm the climate within her party, Chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has also not sought to win her congress on the back of the “small” European countries or countries in difficulty quickly criticizing the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe consecrates a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except for creux.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic Army.
What is the fraud for disease arrests?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux to visit a family allocation box, and pronounce a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistant.
And to accompany this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make savings in a strict context, but is not less announcing an axle of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on the disease arrests.
First, with a budget savings aim: the government is planning to impose a fourth day of shortage to private employees before taking care of a stop of work.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, a sick employee would lose four days of wage, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but would report €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another, more symbolic scope: impose an uncompensed deficiency day to officials in case of discontinuation (they have no deficiency time until now, against three days in private).
While these issues are in discussion, the majority also repeats the theme of fraud, targeting this time abuse related to work stops.
“The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be refunded,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL micro Sunday, November 13.
Like in other cases, the advertising effects appear slightly disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stops.
Since 2002, it has been subject to constant follow-up and political offensives, which have most often brought their fruit.
The French are not more sick than in Europe.
First, let's focus on national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million daily compensation were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation in Economics, daily compensation accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
On that sum, 46% were related to maternity leaves and work accidents, and 54% were related to disease arrests, i.e. €6.2 billion.
2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 working days, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a Alma Consulting group study.
An average that hides certain differences: another survey published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees were saying they had not taken any day of disability.
Another study, this time of health insurance, stated that in 2010, 37% of disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% from one to three months and 11% from beyond.
When comparing them to their European neighbours, French workers are more likely than to work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) vary between 10% and 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Disease stop fraud is very little in front of black work.
With regard to fraud, it only reaches a low extent.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has made the systematic checks on disease sentences for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of 285,000 executed for short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of more than 45 days, systematically controlled sentences, 11% of "unadaptated or unjustified" cases were accounted for 1.2 million, i.e. 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were "unjustified" on several million employees who had a sick arrest.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, that of the work in black.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent €9 to €15 billion of tax shortages per year, which is more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely more than fraud on the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adaptation plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to refine its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said on Monday, November 14, before Parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his union government would not be sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the head of the government, who pronounced his first public speech at the opening of the debate on trust vote in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions made at the euro area summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area is "in play".
As a consequence, Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced by "about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right, on Monday supported already approved measures to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned his party would not engage in an additional austerie.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the MPs of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, and fighting waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, responded Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, a committee of experts said.
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and take provisions for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, to which six experts involved in various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when necessary, to a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the end of the game, experts cited a recent investigation by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
If Canada has ranked 10th there, the study notes that "medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicinalization or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, report experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire for most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying at the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is the highest, with 86% of the deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, who has already said nothing to change the Criminal Code concerning assisted euthanasia and suicide.
But, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted on non-compliance persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, said yesterday that there would be more cases of such overthrows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Aid suicide is conducted in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians favouring euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already pronounced euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their life to relieve their sufferings, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for people who have committed suicide assisted, surveys estimate 41% that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the maintenance or ceasefire of care in a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Thus, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which a legally valid refusal was not criminal.
The Committee also urges healthcare professionals to be trained to comply with a refusal to take care at the end of their lives without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, as regards palliative or terminal sedimentation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves from other experts
Some health law experts have already issued reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the Canadian Royal Society experts.
Pierre Deschamps, a health professional, has called the "extreme" position of the signatory experts of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final phase.
"It opens the door to a situation where everyone who was tired of life and who was over 18 years old could ask what we could help suicide," said Me Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the person's autonomy above all other values that participate in the social tissue of society.
"In society, he says, there are signs and constraints."
Margaret Somerville, Health Law Specialist, also expressed “a strong opposition” to the conclusions of the report, which she called “pro-euthanasia manifesto”.
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests in particular data on the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Dames denounced a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Partisans from Bachar al-Assad protested yesterday in front of the foreign ministry’s premises.
The diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria of Bachar al-Assad, who, with Russia’s support, resists and denounced a “complot” against the country.
Two days after Syria was suspended by the Arab League, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, Syrian neighbours, have taken a position in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar al-Assad to "quit power" in Syria where forty civilians and members of the regime were still killed.
“If Bachar had the interest of his country, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” said Jordan’s neighbouring country king in an interview with the BBC.
Ahmet Davutoglu, the Turkish diplomat, regretted that Turkish mediation efforts undertaken by the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had failed.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alleging Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey adopts a more and more harder line.
The United States welcomed a "reforcing consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the Arab League and the European Union's decisions.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey are adopting an increasingly tough tone" in front of the Syrian repression, said Mark Toner, a spokesman from the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians were killed by "the heavy-duty shooting and pillaring exchanges in Jobar" in the city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "going towards the end of the crisis."
He has also reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus of its work, which, according to him, constitutes “a dangerous step”.
Syria will "not be frightened," he added, ensuring that "orders' complots against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civil protection mechanism” and wishes to send 500 Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said favored the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime that he believes ended up in the paranoia.
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to take a look at the implementation of the crisis outlet plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities in question and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov judged the Arab League's decision "incorrect" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis outlet plan while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices to Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has called for a little time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain “sacrifice,” to recover the lost credibility in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting the trade unions and the patronat today.
It should establish a relatively limited cabinet consisting of technocrates outside the Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the interviews, after meeting the appointed Council President.
The Chairman of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said to expect Mario Monti to request a trusted vote in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has adequate support.
The consultations will end by the presentation of Mr. Monti of a limited list of dozens of ministers to the head of the state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on the nervousness of the exchange and obligatory markets yesterday, demanding them time.
In "democracy, there are precise times" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying, "Be sure the markets will be patient and will understand."
His appointment by the President had initially been greeted by the markets, but the concern was recovered, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The nominated Prime Minister should be a team that includes mainly technocrates, even though he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government must last until 2013, the date of the upcoming legislation, he said.
According to the President of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament’s confidence by Friday.
Mr. Monti, once entering office, has committed to working in the emergency and the aim that Italy "become a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokeswoman of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new rigorous measures.
Italian patron Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to rebuild the economy, “because a country with no growth cannot comply with deficit parameters.”
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a “change of time” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, the “professor” symbolising “the serious challenge” and “other Italy”, according to editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid pre-elections, as Italy should place by April 2012 for €200 billion of State bonds.
Russian scientist has helped Iran’s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a useable detonator with nuclear weapons, a U.S. NGO specialized in nuclear risk said Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (AIEA) and other documents issued by the United Nations Agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA reported last week on its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS, largely in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheliabinsk (Oural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew well this technique, but who, as a Member State, has informed the Agency, worked during the most of its career on this technology within its country of nuclear origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence has slightly decreased or little advanced, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49% increase, against 13% increase in Catholic violence, 4% decrease in Jewish crimes and 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are motivated by racial differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbed to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” the Human Rights First organization emphasized, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious human rights violation," said Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and has to do more to tackle these abuse,” he added, considering that this could happen by improving police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death for punishment of racial violence, skin color, religion, origin, and now sexuality.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in its presentation on Monday, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes their service a little more similar to that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" tab allow you to keep track of the activity of other "Twitter", users who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you live.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to spread a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user), opens to a broader audience with a more comparable handling to that of large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users suddenly discussed "tweets" cut into the interests of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me to better track some elements of my Twitter stream," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austrian
The inscription of a "Gold Rule" in the Constitution
The government of a large social-democratic/Christian coalition at power in Austria decided on Tuesday to enroll a "gold" budgetary rule in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by Austria’s sovereign notation agencies.
Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision to the Council of Ministers, while Austria's public debt is 74.6%, largely above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but significantly below debt from countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced only by one cran, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest extra each year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is following a request from the summit of the euro area member countries in Brussels on 26 October last: the heads of state and government had then requested the entry by the end of 2012 to reduce public deficits and return to public account balance in the Constitution or in a law of the same value.
The system adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) annually, and by 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The goal is to move public debt to 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens a new intervention in the exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would interfere again on the exchange market if the yen would continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did for the last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went not far from the historical levels that pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yens against dollars to lower the value of the nippon currency that had just established a new record of validity since 1945 against the green banknote.
But the yen has been regularly risen since, overwhelmed by purchases of investors who consider it as a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was transferred on Tuesday under the 77 yens and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of the 105 yens, near the levels that launched the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was more than 160 yen.
This flame of the nippon currency damages the archive’s exports as it lowers the cost of Made in Japan and reduces the value of foreign income from Japanese companies when converting them into national currency.
"Japan struggles to rebuild itself" since the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (nord-east), Noda stressed fearing that this yen rebound will not kill the fragile recapture in the egg.
The third global economic power has renewed with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound of exports and consumption of households flooded by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister considered that the yen’s cherished wasn’t reflecting “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, in his part, called the Bank of Japan (BoJ), who opened Tuesday a two-day meeting of his monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", letting hear that no additional monetary relief was to wait on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuer institute increased its purchases of Treasury's goods by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion) to the ceiling of the amount it devoted to the purchases of different financial securities to invade the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
The rates rise, the exchange rates flanch
The risk of contagious debt crisis still reduces European indexes.
Despite the designation of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the euro area, the European Exchanges are slightly more in a negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10:00 p.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
“With the new tensions on the profits of the loans of the euro area states in difficulty, share markets around the world continue to make part of their recent profits.”
“The investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contamination,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed market players’ fears about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow variation corridor until investors have no evidence that the situation is stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This regain of concerns about the future of the euro area criminalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved at its lowest level for a month and a half.
About 10h, the European currency is worth $1,3570, replying 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she resumed after the Chancellor Angela Merkel party, the CDU, meeting on Monday Congress, adopted a motion providing particularly the possibility for a difficult country to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are more than 6%
The loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds at 10 years of age reached 6.85%, the return of Spanish securities of the same maturity of 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of the participants.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti called for time to markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxie by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos stated that the implementation of the decisions made at the summit of the euro area on October 27 would be his government's " principal task " .
Spain is located in the market view line, while legislative elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The difference between 10-year bonds between Germany and Spain has reached a new higher history.
In expectation of the euro area's growth figures
In addition to statistics, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than expected by 0.3% in household consumption.
However, Insee reviewed the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth one who is worried most about the economists.
Germany, on its own, saw a 0.5% growth in the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11 p.m. while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts have to overcome it on dogmas
If it is a subject that cannot be handled from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotions, it is well energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects purchasing power and corporate competitiveness.
It is healthy that an election meeting is the opportunity to think about such issues and the place where nuclear is held.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will double the demand for electricity by 2050 unless a huge part of the world’s population is a vital element.
At the same time, the rare refreshment of fossil resources will be needed to continue to produce continuous electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate disorder, a missing topic of environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for either Belgium, which submits its own to the need to find a replacement source capable of substituting itself, nor for Switzerland, which simply means to build only last-generation plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite only them, continue their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a interrupted plant after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality is contrary to speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the rising price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on imported gas, particularly Russia, and a bond of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants to gas and coal.
In a few months, all of these angry effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
Europe’s wind champion, of which it draws 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest coal and gas users due to wind interference; according to which its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constance of our energy policy, our neighbours have an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy energy cost is a key factor in competitiveness and a key factor in the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Therefore, significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would result in a significant increase in electricity prices, which would illustrate the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French refuse to pay, so far that they do not demonstrate principle opposition to this energy, surveys show it.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has enabled the construction of an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
It is a strongly exporting galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very creative for jobs not to be displaced.
If France had just decided to leave nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of sadness the 6 billion euros annually of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to work for sixty years while its manufacturer’s decline would be scheduled?
To resolve the equation of energy, it is necessary to admit that there is no source of miracle electricity, no more than there is a devil.
Areva’s development of low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions proves the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a security authority in France that exercises intransigent and transparent control of existing plants as well as on the Flamanville farm.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited with the same security obsession.
In a half-century, the nuclear industry experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened in normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the concept of the reactor and unforgiving human mistakes caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that have caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take away the lessons of this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that enables them to resist such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a plant, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving their way free to acquire leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is imperative and legitimate to seek the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave the emotion, dogmas and supportive manoeuvre to dominate a debate as decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles - the provision of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France's "people of human rights".
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students being subject to the news, the Minister of Interior (Read Release of 23 May) proclaimed in the passage that France "is not in need of foreign talents, butts and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this subject.
To the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac, who stated in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard, explaining that France "can't welcome the whole world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of Polish plombier hordes of the national territory was shared on the left and on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that we will harm to give to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande cantonates on banals, indicating that co-development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally paying; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalled in a recent book synthesising the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a wide consensus among economic experts on the growth salt and positive impact of migration flows re-enhancing countries.
Limit immigration anemia growth and harms employment.
The fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, particularly those who are not qualified, with a reduction in pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than national employees, mostly employing jobs in shortage sectors.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country with a lack of anesthetics, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real salary in the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a strong proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors of social systems, on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will make a net contribution of €150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of the mandate, wanted to go to search the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to dissuade immigrants, had the exact reverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, during the 20th century experienced the tragedy of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, Colonels in Greece.
Some could believe that it would be enough, so that democracy would definitively triumph over its enemies, exercise the vote, and exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon, the Little, that it was an easy thought.
The universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become a "instrument of oppression", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe in which we are living is a economic crisis, but it is just as well a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true fake Greek referendum will have, in this regard, the value of double revelator: that of the need for a strong return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibleness, of its incongruence.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today have moved, and for many of them Republican soldiers no longer shoot in the right direction.
We have nothing to earn to demand a succession of national referendums, organized on the basis of needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-seat to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump in the vacuum of the nationalist reply: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutters, but an exercise, common, full-right, seren and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there can be no more where to stop the list - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe that sticks to the dictatorships of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its impunity and lack of solidarity.
The whole Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but the whole Europe is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to return to popular sovereignty the European project’s guidelines.
Because together, Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The emergence of the crisis will suppose decisions at European level that cannot be made without a total democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today demands the European economic government.
Call me.
But thinking without a stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such by citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in European construction.
In order to make the Republic of France, the Republicans had to "make" the Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let’s make Europeans.
Puzzle cards "without contact" are widespread
The world-class card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The 2011 year is expected to end with an increase of 11% of global microprocessor card sales (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most portable segment is the one of the contactless technology that allows you to pay public transport or adjust your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share would continue to progress in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent nearly 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains land for non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 non-contact Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bowls.
This year Carrefour issued 2.5 million non-contact MasterCard Pass cards.
In order to move to the higher speed, banks are now required to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed themselves to systematically broadcast banking cards for their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks Tested Mobile Payment
But this is just a first step towards the way of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology essential for transactions.
"They took delay."
“But they should finally know a real rise next year.”
"Our tables on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
The Agriculture Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of about 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a building allowing the payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, she also said yesterday, preparing the marketplace of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida and Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
During a long time, the links between the al-Qaida terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algeria has now "acquired certainty".
"The way both organizations work and intelligence services reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any further precision.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into two French kidnappings in Niger in January would have updated the passages.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as many of their fans during an operation launched by the French Special Forces.
In the downfalls of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phone shots belonging to terrorists.
The Axe of Terrorism
The analysis of past calls focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two figures are particularly interested in investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, one city in northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram Bay, and the other to a man who speaks close to Aqmi and the sect.
“It’s an advance, but we’ve probably got to wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have been aware for years that the sect has been benefiting from external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” have been increasingly evident in Boko Haram’s evolution and speeches or in its operational modes, which now involve the use of more and more complex kamikazes or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pushed Abuja to take into account Boko Haram’s problems.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of low-interested illuminated people.
Quick Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Haoussa "western education is a sin" - pronounced the establishment of an Islamic emirat in the northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has a rapid success.
She politics and requires strict respect for charia while her militants engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The latter focuses first on churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, multipliing the attacks against the commissioners.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without shades.
The army invested the city, there were 800 people killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its feathers from the north.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that kills 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram was taken to the police's secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, which al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said "to share all the information."
The world according to Republican candidates to presidency
On China, on Iran, on Israeli aid, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete with simplicity and unknownness.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, or even simple ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have multiplied tonitruan statements and shortened foreign policy, traditionally a very Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on the help of Israel, slogans - often unsupported - merge.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the nomination of the Grand Old Party, threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and question them "for their currency manipulation", a carrier theme in an America exaspered by the migration of the entire pans from its industry to Asia.
As bad as this should involve the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China, and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, failed to excite himself to a attitude that “flatters” the emotions.
He called for a muscle but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stains in the depths of the surveys, remains inexhaustible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations towards this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows him a shameful misconception of the dossiers.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China holds the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism.
They are rightly insisting on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the departure of Iraq's "boys" too fast, on his tergiversations in Libya, as a result, a low label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers rather positive Obama’s national security balance, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has defeated military interventions that lead to inclusion.
And arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama hits more fairly.
The Nord Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipe, which directly connects Western Europe to Russia by crossing the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brightness.
More than 500 guests, of which four heads of state and government participated on the coast of the Baltic on Tuesday, between orchestra and end buffet, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new gas pipe that directly connects Russia to Germany under sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch homologus Mark Rutte turned together the valve commanding the Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion extra cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe every year by a 1,224 km pipeline connecting the region of Saint Petersburg to the Mecklembourg-Pomérania Land.
A second pipeline must be completed at the end of 2012, allowing to deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already discussing the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion of this huge farm in time and in time has airs of victory.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will actually allow the delivery of gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passage by a third country (Pologne or Ukraine).
By the way, these two countries lose a bit of power: it becomes harder for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
In the strongest part of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, providing its support for this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supply.
But this is at the price of a weakening of energy Europe, as the project created a breakthrough between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In five years, Russia has barely triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, strongly gas consumers, and their decrees are in decline.
"This gas pipe is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," Francis Fillon confirmed by opening this gas pipe, demonstrating how large gas contracts are as political as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the Gazprom leaders, present in number at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exploitation.
The submarine tube is made of concrete steel to protect it from vessels' anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, it had to be avoided mining fields dating from World War II.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by caution,” said Jens Müller, spokeswoman of North Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing breaks all its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned across Sweden, but the project officials rejected it while the Swedish were unwanted to see a Russian state company permanently settled across their coasts.
"In case of assault, we stop the gas passing in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipe is therefore exhausted into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who planned welding to know a escape every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the gas pipe is provided by a submarine robot, driven by a vessel, for external observation, as well as by a apparatus circulating within the gas pipe.
From the form of a cigarette, it is introduced inside the tube, width of a meter of diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
At the arrival, after three full days of trip at a speed of 3 meters, it provides accurate information about possible metal deformations.
The gas pipe was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo the least repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have united their forces to achieve this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), along with the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called Nord Stream, responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the company, for twenty renewable years, all of the gas transport capabilities.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the quantity of actually transported gas," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of gas pipeline was provided by shareholders to 30% and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment has risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to return to their expenses, since only Gazprom assumes risk.
The gas pipe emerges from the Baltic to Lubmin, on a patterned coastal plant of pins.
Valves, height 4.5 meters, form the gas output door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specifications of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to the German gas pipes.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour it spends.
In full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created a fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return the taste of writing.
He has a fragrance of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a bubble.
The Moleskine cart is easily recognized, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of broken white, as old in time.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The carnet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the skin mole (tape skin) which designates a vernis cotton used to cover bankets for example.
This type of book was very appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has given to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-gardist artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to reach 12.7 million coins.
We are far from confidential production in the first years, where only 3,000 books were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It’s hard to set up a buyer’s portrait-robot, as the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open to mind and grown.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, accounts for almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her books in libraries, from Fnac to small city centre shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompany the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own book.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Profiting of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer sleeves... The brand decomposes all over a range of supports.
In the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of people with disabilities so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for disabled people’s employment is open today.
Despite a voluntary public policy established in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19 percent, compared to 9% for the entire population.
Encouraging?
"No, he stressed that Éric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, is the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled people."
"The progress made in the past fifteen years has been significant."
“At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot to do.”
It must be said that for disabled people, obstacles remain many before access to employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor’s degree and the 2.3 million higher education students only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
In short, so many criteria that individually complicate the return to employment, and which “represent the node of the problem”, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
The mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise Association for the City indicated that the interviewed managers had " a low level of knowledge of disability ", with " overrepresentation of persons with rolling chairs, mental or intellectual disabilities " .
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment goal of 6% of disabled workers, as set out in a 1987...
The latest known figures, dated 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of " taxed " establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also leads to real awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What Happiness"
Before confronting the Blues Tuesday evening (20:45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that they offer this friendly match.
It is not until we write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to the Stade de France Auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace well.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praises to do about it.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium.”
“I want to go ahead,” the Lillois says.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and selection, “it is a whole, is it justified.”
"In Lille, I've been there all year round, which isn't the case with Belgium."
“I need to take my brands.”
Awarded against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "bright".
Without the notion of "pleasure".
The Blues has been encouraged since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supporting,” he says.
This will necessarily contribute to further strengthening the “particular” character of this meeting.
"There is Matthew (Debuchy), Juan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"We crossed all the time."
“Can play against them, it’s only happiness!”
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part spoken of the "fear".
"First" to dispute "a gala match".
"Firty" also found that France has become a very high-level team a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc did a tonework,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician will see the plane sharing with the Blue Direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our small Belgians become large,” he said.
“We’re building something, players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You're going to report this in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimistic returning to Bosnia (22:00 p.m.), Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the other hand, the two teams were missing realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, which has been on hand since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to get rid of.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seemed obvious that the games were not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but was unable to mark this very valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
“This is a good result, which, however, poses a certain risk because we haven’t scored a goal outside.”
But at their home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced of passing, in front of a public that should be as bouncing there, even though the party is obviously "very narrow," said a optimistic but brilliant Bento.
"We are waiting for a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can take the top," the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We continue to have 50% chances of being in the Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz said.
Bosnia’s non-reported Friday forced the Portuguese to mark and win.
Nobody can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to mark them.
“It’s a good result, however, which poses a certain risk because we haven’t scored a goal outside,” Bento regrets.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of putting a maximum pressure on the Bosnians in order to “not give them time to think.”
A good idea, provided that it becomes realistic this time.
