Technological Determinism is a term that covers a wide range of ideas in practice - from technological pressure or technological imperative to the stricte sensation that human destin is led by logic associated with science laws and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are shared between the majority of interpretations of technological demerminism: the development of technology itself goes on a path, which is far beyond cultural or political influence, or the technology itself influences society present, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, a person can say that the motor vehicle must lead to the development of roads.
However, a national road network will not be economically beneficial only for a car sheet, so new methods of production are developed to reduce the value of ownership of a car.
Mass ownership of cars also led to the increased frequency of accidents on roads, which requires the invention of new techniques in health care to restore damaged bodies.
Romanticism contains a large element of cultural determinism, whose beginnings are placed by writers like Gothe, Fichte and Schlegel.

Internet combines elements both of mass, and of individual communication.
The special features of the internet lead to additional dimensions in relation to the use of the approach to satisfying.
Por ejemplo, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for internet usage (James et al., 1995).
"Personal participation" and "permanent relationships" were also defined as new aspects of motivation by Imey and McCord (1998), when they studied the reactions of public to websites.
Using video resulted in important discoveries in interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements, which dure several milliseconds.
It is affirmed in particular, that a person can find out if a person is lying, interpreting correct micro-expressions.
Oliver Sax, in his work "President's Word", indiferent to the fact that people who can't understand the speech because of brain damage, are able to perceive honest attitude.
It even suggests that similar ability to interprete human behavior can be shared by animals, such as pet dogs.
Studies in the 20th century have shown that there are 2 groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations forward - back between the two pools with each generation.
In savannah, it's difficult to get with a digestive system like that of people to satisfy their necessity of amino acids through available plant resources.
More importantly, the consequences of failure are serious: depression of growth, lack of food, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be proteins from the leaves and seeds of the bob plants, but they are difficult to melt from us unless they are prepared.
Contrary to this, foods of animal origin (therms, mushrooms, eggs) are not only easy-to-smallable, but also provide a large amount of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Considering all this, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" the same way the chimpanzees in the sauna today do it.

Although the rail roads were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed horses to reach greater speed and to charge more cargo than the more inequaliable roads characteristics of that time.
Traverses were introduced relatively early to stop the rails on the site. However, gradually, it became clear that the rails would be more efficient with a jersey band above.
This became the usual practice, but iron caused more extrusion of wooden wheels in the wagons.
The wooden wheels were gradually replaced by iron. In 1767 were introduced the first total iron reels.

Biological watches are self-supporting oscillators, which will continue to execute the cycle of free movement, even if there are no external signals.
One of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material, was the experiment made by Hershy and Chase.
Hersh and Chase used fagis or viruses to put their DNA in bacteria.

Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction between them.
Since unfortunately, the conduct of leaders cannot be predicted with 100% security, studying the flow of traffic is difficult.
Fortunately, the drivers tend to act within a relatively consistent range; so traffic flows have a certain logic sequence and can be represented approximately mathematical.
For a better view of the flow of movement, the connections between the three main characteristics are determined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help in the planning, design and ultimately operation of road installations.
The insects are the first animals that fled in the air. Their ability to fly has helped them to escape their enemies easier and find food and beat more effectively.

In general, after the managers begin to lead their ex-company, it is possible to appear in two behaviors. On the one hand, they are those who try to stay "I'm from our boys" (or girls).
This type of managers encounter difficulties in implementing disciplinary measures, making unpopular decisions, evaluation of activity, atribution of responsibility and demand for responsibility by people.
A man becomes, in the other direction of the spectrum, a person unknown, who feels that he must change everything he's done and make him his own.
Finally, the leader is responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
Such behavior often leads to breaking between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams comply with the same standards for distinction as normal, but there are fine differences.
Members of the virtual team often functione as a point to establish contact with their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular members of the team, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
