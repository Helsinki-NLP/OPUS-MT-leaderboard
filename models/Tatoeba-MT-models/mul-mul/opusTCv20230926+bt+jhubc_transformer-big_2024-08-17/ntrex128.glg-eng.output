Members of the Wales Assembly are worried "to take them for monicrees"
Consternation between some of the members of the Assembly, currently called in English AM, by the assumption that they should change the name by the MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate was discussed by the plans to change the name of the Assembly by the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of all the panorama are afraid to be subject to ridiculation.
A member of the Labour Party told his group that the new name was "winding with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't know gallery, "twp" means "fool" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's set "was not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A gallery conservative said his group maintained a "mind open" about name change, but he stressed that from MWP to Muppet there was only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter "w" in gallery pronunciation in a similar way to the pronunciation in English of Yorkshire from the letter "u".
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Galles Government Act of 2017 gave the Galles Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals showing a lot of support for the designation of the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Gallean parliament or WMP, but MWP’s choice received the majority of support in a public consultation.
It looks like the AM are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to finish the consensus could result in headaches for President Elin Jones, which is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, such as the rules of inactivation of the AM and the design of the committee system.
The AM will receive the final vote on how they should be called when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians join urns in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that lasts decades with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens takes a long time insisting that the name of its north neighbor represents a complaint from its territory and repeatedly opposes its requests for EU and NATO accession.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the change of name in the plebiscite, said he would make a case for the vote.
However, the defenders of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is no longer the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s camps keep silence while Harlem’s churches continue to fight
"The elders told me that there was a bar and a church in each corner before," said Adams.
“Today, not one thing or the other.”
He said he could understand that the bars would disappear.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which people usually go.”
With regard to churches, he fears that the asset sale money does not last as much as the leaders expect, and "before or later they will return where they started".
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of people who would not help the neighborhoods to remain sanctuary.
“The immense majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore they will accelerate the burden of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black church came to the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation led by reverent John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the street 125, a commercial street in Harlem that resisted hiring and ascending to black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Dad Johnson's fridges made plans to rebuild it, they charged the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson, and his successor at St. Martin, baptized the cardinal with pride as "the camps of the poor."
The expert who touched the carillon in July called another way: "A cultural treasure" and "a unsubstitutable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also stressed that he was the world's first carillon played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who changed him by the largest carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have taken St. Martin in the last few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the Laic leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parochial joint, the organ that governs the parochial and is composed of Laic leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing her concern that the latter "considers to impact costs" together, although it did not participate in the hiring of the architects and contractors that sent the diocese.
Some frequencies have complained of lack of transparency by the diocese.
A tiburon hurts a boy while fishing laughs in California
Police reported that a tiburon attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing submarine fishing in search of landing in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th of the morning near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel narrated her at KSWB-TV in San Diego that spent about half an hour bugging with friends on Saturday morning when she heard the boy asking for help from the pigs, a time when she swimed with a group of people to help get rid of water.
Hammel said that at first I thought it was just an excitement for fishing a larvae, but soon it realized that I was drinking "They worked on me!
They worked for us!"
I had the keyboard scratched." Hammel said she got out when the boy came to the wave.
"Speak to all the world that comes out of the water, 'There is a bubble in the water!'" Hammel said.
The boy was transferred in helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was entering a critical state.
You know the type of tiburon responsible for the attack.
The rescue officer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press release that they would divide a bubble in the area a few weeks ago, but that they determined it wasn't a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for safety reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of tiburons in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to introduce itself to the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty brokers similar to the major warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK's beauty market, which is up to £2,800 million and continues to grow while sales in fashion and home products fall, the largest brokers with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will soon pass to others next year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when the supermarkets are seeking to fill with the stains that on their day occupied televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its offer of beauty products until 3,000 products came out, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those you can see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also releasing its range of Boutique makeup so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanding by the younger customer.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that results in buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will look more and more like shopping malls, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced sales points of Argos and Habitat in hundreds of tenants, since he bought the two chains two years ago. For example, this strengthened the sales of foodstuffs and profitabled the acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury’s launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the association came to its end after a dispute on how to distribute pharmacies’ income in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was noted that Lloyds would participate in the plan by incorporating a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: “We transformed the image of our beauty brokers to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff than to what you can visit to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to adapt to all the needs and attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones "furiate" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds of business
The star of the Dragons Den program, Peter Jones, marched "furious" after television shower Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for its Truly home clothing and accessories brand.
Its company was compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her divorce.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones threw chips out of his last minute lifestyle brand to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicated that Jones was "furiate" when the golden television girl admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business, valued 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to devote to both home clothing and accessories, Truly.
The business was compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, and it was predicted to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, a 37-year-old, visited Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones joined a plane to Britain and headed to one of his holiday residences.
A source said, “Truly was different from one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be your long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of goods at Marlow’s offices ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of This Morning is among the most profitable stars in Britain could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products that go from cooks and candles to clothes and textiles to home, and which could delay their release even more.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are the parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The pairs went together vacation and Jones has a 40% participation in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will turn into M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter in the ITV I'm program to Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We shouldn't comment on your business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we're dating"
He broke with the criticism he would receive by the means to make a comment that some would consider “not a president’s own” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he put his voice as a telejournalist.
"Don't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in June in Singapore, which Trump considered a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But negotiations for denuclearization have continued.
More than three pieces after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North does not see the "corresponding response" by the U.S. to the first North Korean disarmament measures.
On the contrary, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exercise pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic vision in his mitin speech.
“The things with North Korea are fine,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
It would have killed millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He claimed that his efforts to improve Kim’s relationships had positive results: finishing the tests with missiles, helping the prisoners release and bringing home the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this amphitheatre, we’d have about 200 people here,” Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami destroy an island in Indonesia leaving hundreds of dead
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population had been displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they did not apply for international assistance, which is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether the foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly supports, the country is extremely poorly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although refugees for tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other sides.
Although a warning is issued, the absence of a tsunami warning sirena in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life.
In the best of these cases, travelling between many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was outstanding in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake is going to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign turned around the improvement of Indonesia's deteriorated infrastructure, and earned money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final straight to the re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continuous sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims adopted a way to live the more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes due to confrontations in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge marks the goal of match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a victory in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal on Saturday 89 at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri being still about 27 meters from the Chelsea gateway with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot to the second pavement.
The balloon crossed the area while moving towards the upper left corner of the network.
The ball finally fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entered the network.
"I was only trying to get to that position, organize ourselves, and players like Shaq always play the ball as far as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I'm coming closer to Kante and touching without thinking too much and I just shot."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the rest after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
The front of the Blues passed the ball to Matthew Kovacic in this game, before turning near the middle change and entering the Liverpool camp.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
I made a beautiful walk in depth leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard surpassed the defense and ended in the second peace marking a shooting with the dirt that Alisson Becker was not the only one to stop.
Liverpool faces Naples at the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will make the videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesian tsunami death tolls up to 832
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency on Sunday morning.
Many people would have been trapped between the buildings' squads that came below the 7.5-squad earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press roll, the spokesman of the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency said.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with shells from broken buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old suspect of murder after a woman died in a hospital
It opened a murder investigation after finding a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in the morning with white gun wounds in John Street, and detained a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area to turn or hear something from a step forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its initial stage, but I would like to make a call to contact us anybody near John Street in Birkenhead that looks or hears any suspicious thing.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera of the command frame that will be contacted with us, as they could have key information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body found belonged to a neighborhood of Birkenhead and was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who thought to meet the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was found that morning.
The investigation continues while the police are in the process of informing the closest family of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but the police reported that they didn’t allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man left without words when he found out what had happened.
The residents just knew they wouldn’t be able to enter again within a few hours.
A police officer was heard to tell a man that the area is considered the crime scene.
A woman crying on the scene.
Not to say "it's awful."
At 2 p.m. there were two police truck inside the cordon with another truck right outside.
Several officials stay within the cord watching the apartment block.
Anyone who has information, ask to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at phone number 0800 555 555 111 citing registration 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by its fans and Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society qualified Mr. Crick's suggestion of "disparate" and "to try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the withdrawal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace became an objective.
The iconoclast of the British Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
If the frame would have sacrificed Cromwell wrongly for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell performed by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the opinion that existed in the 19th century, and part of the history of a figure that many consider still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, as a defender of parliament to external pressure, in this case, of course, was treated by monarchy.
Whether or not a complete representation is an object of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the 17th-century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure that represents a side of the division.
Their achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
A pig killer slaughtered a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and murdered a farmer in a Southwest China market.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the name, "Yuan," was found dead with a separated artery and blood covered by a necklace in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pork farmer is preparing to put the vaccines to the pigs in a cortex on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
She seemed to travel with her curman on Wednesday from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his curman found him dead and discovered an open door that gave another adjacent cortex.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, about 250 pounds, attacked the farmer until he was killed.
"My cousin had his legs stretched and sneaky," the cousin, called "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. Thursday to give him food to his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his neighbour.
A market director told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for their death.
Although they are not very common, there are no more cases of pigs that attack humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years ago, a roughly 300 pounds pig crushed a gallery farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood taste can act as "disparator."
"They're just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they don't intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect,” he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane will bring strong and generalized rains to the southwest of the U.S.
The forecast indicates that Rosa hurricane is weakened as it overflows the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring turning rain to northern Mexico and southwest U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 p.m. on Sunday morning, east time, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hopefully Rose will go north or Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, a valve begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards, as Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture towards north, which will penetrate the southeast of the United States.
Rose will bring more than 250 l/m2 rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valve will create abundant and generalized rain in the southwest over the next few days.
At local level, precipitations of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, flood flows and the possibility of land displacement in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitations that will reach 50 or 75 l/m2 in point areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest it is expected from 50 to 100 l/m2 rain, especially on large part of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise to adventure in the desert under tropical rain threat.
The strong rain could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and the electric storms will bring locally frozen winds and poetry.
The valve will bring locally strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total precipitation could be more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller shells and steep roads.
These would be the first rainfall in the region’s moist station.
Tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and first of Monday, before the rain extends at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Abundant rain will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness major temperature variations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropicals will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the U.S. center.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern planes to the northern part of the country.
New York could reach the 26 degrees on Tuesday, which constitutes approximately 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high probability of temperatures above the average east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the loving witnesses of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and chains interrupt their usual schedule for a new last minute on Friday: an agreement designed by Senator Jeff Flake, to make the FBI a weekly investigation into the posts.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he was sure that Kavanaugh made his touches being drunk and tried to pull her clothes on a party at the school.
In a loving witness, Kavanaugh said he was completely sure that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company told media audiences at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other chains that retransmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with measuring people watching television from offices.
To make an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, who largely supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a judgment that lasted the day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement indicating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, being arrested by protesters when he tried to enter a road elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stayed with the low look for several minutes while he was retrieved, live TV at CNN.
“I’m here in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
He said, "You have power while you have many unprotected women."
Flake said her office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was shut down, said he would have more than to say in the committee hearing.
All TV and cable chains were broadcast live hours after the Judiciary Committee had to vote to make Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to vote.
But Flake said that it would only do if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominated next week, which insisted on a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into claims against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of “playing politics” with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused anyone who criticized her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to harm national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her in the press release, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should pick up the oranges on the other hand was "fully absurd".
Wayde Sims murdered: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect of carrying out the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (Louisiana State University).
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
The officers issued the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims would lose glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the scene's glasses and claimed they contain Simpson's DNA, according to CBS's affiliate channel, WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to be the shooter who killed Wayde.
The defence said he was charged with a $350,000 mortgage.
The East Baton Rouge parochial forensic office issued a preliminary report indicating that the cause of death is a ball wound on the head that reached the neck.
The department elected the Louisiana State Police Fujitive Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police for its help to get the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local order forces his "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 race was created in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 reboots.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "beaten" and "disturbed" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what concerns us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano grey arrows on Mexico City
The wounds that throw the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to get away from the volcano after crater activity was detected and 183 gas and gray emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several storms and tremors.
Social media images showed fine layers of gray in the parabries of Mexico City districts as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have detected an increase in volcano activity located 72 kilometers south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflict between Police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters faced anti-disturbance police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarization vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proseparators contained by the police anti-disturbance guided eggs and paint where they created dark-pound clouds in the streets that usually are atheistic of tourists.
There were also refreshments later that same day with the police, who used the pores to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independent groups who were Koreans who “never forget or forgive,” faced Unionist protesters shouting “Length Life to Spain”.
14 people had to be killed by mild wounds received in the protest, according to local press.
The tension continues to bloom in the independent region a year after the October 1 referendum held by the Catalan separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters voted strongly for independence, although the participation was low and the opponents of the secession boicotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote at the election tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration took place as well, but was required to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electricist who attended the independentist demonstration with his wife, said he had no longer hopes for the possibility that Catalonia could achieve independence.
Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I came to my parents crying for joy when they could vote, but now we are upset,” he said.
Despite the achievement of an adjusted victory, although decisive, in the last December regional elections, this year the Catalan pro-independent parties fought for maintaining the impulse, with many of their most well-known leaders in a self-tax exile or detained in wait of judgment for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was powered by both sides’ politicians.
"Every time there is more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in preventive jail since last year, announced that next year would be presented to the European Parliament elections.
“Presenting as a candidate to European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: A man is arrested after a car hits a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car arrested several times against a Londonderry house.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in the UK).
Police investigator Bob Blemmings declared whether the building was injured and the building itself was damaged.
It is also possible to shoot a gun against the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ends in victory
The uplifted Livingston surprised Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after the Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's team continues to run out of the house this year in Premiership and next Sunday confronts the leader, Hearts, which separates them from eight points.
But before the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Namentres, Livingston continues to be invicted in the division for sixth consecutive match; the main coach, Holt, does not yet know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler or my past.
Livingston Leads to escape opportunities to weakened visitors
Holt's team had to go ahead long before the time they scored, since with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the road, but his cross-fire did not cross the gateway threshold; then, Alan Lithgow's shooting went out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the gateway.
The host team consisted of leaving the Rangers to play in front of them, aware that they could put visitors in danger at the ball stops.
And that’s how the decisive goal was reached.
Rangers gave a free shooting and Livingston made a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix the Menga, which touched the ball and marked from the center of the area.
At that time, Rangers dominated possession, but grew up with an impenetrable defence that prevented him from working with Liam Kelly's guard.
This model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's stop.
Rangers' guard, Allan McGregor detained a shot by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent the ball out of another playing the Livingston stop ball.
There were many crossed passages in the Livingston area that were continuously displaced, while two penalty requests were rejected: one by one hand and the other by a Halkett entry to the replacement Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
A performance and a phenomenon result for Livingston.
They have been excellent and are still experiencing expectations in their ascending trajectory.
His game style and players have just changed since he returned to the highest category, but part of the merit is Holt's by the way he has driven the team from his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, supervised a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not give them a breath throughout the game to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers missed inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's order, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last step. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All a call to the Rangers, which is located in half the table.
Erdogan receives ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and blue sky during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which intends to arrange relations between NATO allies.
They have dismissed many issues, including human rights, freedom of press and access to the EU from Turkey.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city gathers the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many Erdogan's supporters came to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (a lot of Kurdish) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive it in the country.
The duel of manifestations reflects the division in front of a visitor acclaimed as hero by some German Turks and criticized as autocratic by others.
Car accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies when crashing with a car
A cyclist died in a collision where a car was surrounded in London.
The accident took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transit street from Deptford, southwest of the city, around 10:15 p.m. (summer time in Britain).
The driver stopped and the doctors arrived, but the man died in the act.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist died in an atropello with escape at Childers Street a little more than a mile and a half of the Saturday crash.
The metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
There are road stops and buses were dismantled and advised drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Wounded in Disturbances
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security prison injury, according to the prison officer.
The disturbance began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 p.m. (Summer time in Britain) on Sunday and still continues.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officials came to deal with the disturbances, in which eight prisoners are involved containing a flag.
The officers received attention from mild injuries on the face.
A prison service spokesman said: “The prison personnel were deprived of specially trained to cope with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff had to be treated by injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that the officers will be handed over to the police and will be able to spend more time between kings."
HMP Long Lartin hosts over 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the director of the prison centre had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-disturbance officers had to go to prison to calm up a revolt in which the staff was attacked with billar balls.
The Rosa Hurricane threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by dryness could benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that it will occur early next week, when the remaining energy of the Rosa hurricane crosses the Southwest Desert, leaving possible sudden floods.
The National Meteorology Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hopefully Rose will pass directly on Phoenix or Tuesday and arrive the last hour of Monday with rain.
Phoenix’s National Meteorology Service indicated in a Twitter post that “only ten tropical cyclones would maintain the state of depression or tropical storm at a 320-kilometer radius from Phoenix since 1950.
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended to a 64-kilometer radio from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorology Service predict 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 at Bordo Mogollón in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rochosas and the Great Conca, could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible total isolation of 100 l/m2.
For those who are outside of the danger of sudden floods, Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is very affected by droughts.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the Southeast is experiencing dryness.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme dry, the second largest category,” weather.com said.
First, the Rosa hurricane will touch land on the Peninsula of Low California in Mexico.
Rosa, which will still have furacan force on Sunday morning, with a maximum of 136 km/h wind, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north to 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is found with cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to touch land in Mexico with force of tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday night.
It could rain with a lot of intensity in some areas of Mexico, assuming a significant risk of flood.
"The total precipitation is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, and it is possible to reach up to 250 l/m2," weather.com reports.
Rosa then heads north through Mexico in the form of tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday's first hour as tropical depression and then continues to climb across Arizona and enter Utah in the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains is the strong precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the Southwest Desert of the U.S.," the National Center of Furacáns said.
It is hoped that these rains can cause sudden trumpets of water and flooding flows in the deserts, and earthquakes in mountainous lands.
Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspected murder attempts to find a 16-year-old boy with white gun wounds.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Great Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, during the night three boys were arrested in the Radstock area, respectively, 17, 18 and 20 years old.
The officials asked for the collaboration of any person who had a recording on the mobile that happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “have suffered the Democratic Party’s indignation and cholera”
"Voting for judge Kavanaugh is to reject the desperate and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a statement in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “have suffered the Democratic Party’s misconception and anger” throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of assaulting her sexually decades ago, being adolescent.
Ford also testified in the judgment on his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that that day the “Americans” were witnesses of Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.
"A vote to confirm the judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best judges of our time with an unpleasant public service history," he said, addressing the crowd of admirers in Western Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the Republican results in half-mandate elections.
“It’s about five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t work, but really if I do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for big candidates.”
Trump argued that the mission of Democrats is to “obstacle and obstacle.”
The first processional vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, according to an assistant from the Republican Party.
Indonesian earthquake and tsunami cause hundreds of deaths and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of which were pulled by giant waves that broke the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into the ground to the luscophosco, lifting up the lives of many and destroying everything at their foot.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-sized earthquake.
"Once, when he threatened, the people were still with their activities on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a prison role in Yacarta.
"The tsunami didn't see alone, pulled cars, trucks, house, pulled everything he found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami would travel to the sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people went up to the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The air photographs spread by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many devastated tents and buildings, bridges and bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the city on the coast on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in a area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Assessment and Application Technology Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said that thousands of homes, shopping centers and hotels were coming below.
Some of the bodies of the victims were trapped under the shells of the ruined buildings, he said, leaving 540 people injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damage could be larger along the northern coast of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epiccentre of the earthquake.
The communications remained "completely paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was hardly criticized on Saturday for not being informed of the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves would arrive at the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a shared fan on social networks, you can hear a man who is on the last floor of a new building frenetically warning about the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In minutes, the water shocks against the beirage by driving ahead of buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a significant removal that caused the cutting of communications across Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
The authorities claim that the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Yacarta and other cities, but evacuated remains urgently in need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport has returned to open but only for emergency tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami’s victim balance exceeds the number of 800.
It's terrible.
During the road that the World Vision staff traveled to reach Palu, where the employees retreated on loan refuges lifted at their office courtyard, they looked at scenes of total destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that many houses were destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even when the groups started the unpleasant task of launching assistance in disaster case, some complained that they were preventing them from traveling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staff supplies from foreigners can fluctuate only if the place of disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that has not yet happened.
“It’s still a disaster at the level of a province,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open up for international aid, but that time has not yet come."
When falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the family and friends of the missing would be hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that alleviate the depressive argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they took a child from a sumidor.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who took two days under the shells with her mother’s body to her caroon.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national parapent team, trains the two missing parapentists for the Asian Games, who finished early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi invited some of the people caught at the Roa Roa hotel to be their students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of the parapent, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the broadcast of the news of the breakdown of the Roa Roa hotel between the parapent community, he desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors who were participating in the beach festival
However, only a grey brand was shown in the messages instead of two blue brands.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he added.
They stole $26,750 while reloading a box in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 to a Brink worker who reloaded a box at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
In a press release, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver would clear a box in the recreational complex and prepare for more money.
While he was busy, another man "fell running behind Brink's employee" and stole him a money bag that he had to deliver.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identity, please contact Newport police by calling 859-292-3680.
The Hunter Kanye West changed the name of Ye
The Hunter Kanye West changed the name of Ye.
In order to announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Of being previously known as Kanye West."
For some time, West, 41, is known for the title of Ye, which used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to launch its new Yandhi album.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who cancelled her assistance by "emotional motives", according to the program's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West already explained earlier that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you'," West said that same year while talking about his disc with a Big Boy radio shower.
"So I'm you, they're you, they're you.
I passed by Kanye, which means the only Ye, which is a reflection of goodness in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous kidnappers who changed the name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to call it Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also pushed out by putting and removing the script and using the majors.
AMLO is committed to not using military against civilians
Mexico’s elected president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has committed to not again using military forces against civilians when the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that he would “not use the military again to repress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, the troops shot on a peaceful demonstration on the square killing about 300 people at a time when the students' movements were raging across Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract boys to criminal bands.
U.S. should double investment in I.A.
According to IA investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, former Google employee, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount he invests in IA in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments were produced after several parts of the U.S. government made announcements on IA, even if the U.S. lacks a formal IA strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be number 1 in IA innovation by 2030.
"Duplicating the IA research budget would be a good start, since the rest of the countries are much further behind than the U.S., and we are looking for the next big advance in IA," Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the chances that the next IA achievement would be done in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese IA companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, she worked in an IA system that won American Othello’s player with a highest score and later was executive at Microsoft Research at Google’s branch in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Robotic Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be the following to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work a lot to get government scholarships, Lee said.
“China is not the one leading academic leaders, but companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university genius to work in IA.
Lee stressed that change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in IA.
"I think they should offer residence cards to IA doctors," he said.
The Chinese State Council published its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China offers funding to individuals from academic institutions in the same way as the National Foundation of Science and other governmental organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is less in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee of Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
In the corner of the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in IA research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation seeking to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum if the country's name is changed.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they wanted to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and blocked applications for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim from its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would harm the ethnic identity of most Slavic Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts on whether the result would reach the minimum 50 per cent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question founded in the referendum was, "Is it in favour of NATO and the EU accession with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Defenders of name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price that is worth paying to obtain admission to entities such as the EU or NATO in Macedonia, one of the emergencies of the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I voted for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many parliamentary members said they would meet the result of the vote and would make it final.
The change of nine would require a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Election Committee argued that at 1 p.m. no irregularity was recorded.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters deposited their vote.
"I'm coming to vote for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for his accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the mounted tents for who would boicte the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with the high head and not through the door of service," Kavadarkov added.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can come to other countries like China and Russia and join the European Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the investment so necessary to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of entering the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a positive result would be the "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the requirement.
Another survey conducted by the Telma Macedonian television chain indicated that 57 percent of the consulted people planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said he was going to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major hit for the pro-western government’s policy since it had accessed power in May to the past.
Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses all Brighton’s defense and ends in a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took account of the defence of Brighton with Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to mark the goal of the minute 65.
The Argentine front received a step in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before going to the open field.
Then Aguero was found surrounded by four green camisoles.
He challenged a defence before surpassing several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton's guardmate Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right of the network.
"Aguero is going through some pe problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"Let's play 55 or 60 minutes.
And that was when it happened.
We were lucky to mark at that moment.”
But Sterling gave the blues the initial advantage in the Premier League confrontation.
The goal was at the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful passage to the corner of the right side to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before driving Sterling towards the opposite position.
The blues put the ball in the wall before leaving the field.
The City faces Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the Rockies
With the Nationals outside the fight for the elimination, there were no many reasons to force other ownership.
But a competitive Scherzer hopes to launch on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but there are only implications in the elimination for the Rockies, which brings an advantage match to Los Angeles Dodgers in the West League Division.
The Rockies have secured at least one position of the convenience with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to close their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but they seem inclined to be what Scherzer is going to be in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for who would be his start number 34, made another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts on 220 2/3 tickets this season.
Trump celebrates a myth in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the electorate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the result in the half-mandate elections.
“Let’s do everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don't do, but really if I do it and for this I'm going everywhere fighting for big candidates," he said.
Trump continued saying, “You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
And they are determined to recover power using any necessary means, evil, and misguidedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, above who they have to go to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’ll never give it.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstacle.”
"And they've seen this for the past four days," he said, qualifying Democrats of "anonymous, valve, noxen, and liars."
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee by citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, who received strong public appointments.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm.. come on, what?
No, no, no, no, no... it was the worst body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer so open.
It is not tolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I wasn’t surprised too much.
After all, they are the last of a series of working members that we are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism with a decision.
In my case, censorship motions criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, randomly issues that Jeremy addressed with previous leaders.
Friday’s Nottingham East Labour Meeting Notification indicated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I took as a working member, the committee’s meetings on Friday night were exactly that.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the ton of many meetings, and the promise of a "more friendly and sensitive" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it has ever started.
It is increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and complains if all opinions are acceptable to the leader of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when companions with those who grew up sharing a similar political vision began to wait for me to retrate and adopt positions with which I would never agree, whether on national security as the EU’s single market.
When I speak publicly, and in fact a little like what I say, there is a tremendous crash and social media attacks censoring central policy, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
It doesn't matter only to me.
In fact, I know they are more lucky than some of my companions, since the comments that are addressed to me are usually of political character.
Impress me the professionality and determination of the companions facing a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every "unconfidence" movement or any change in the rules of selection, the party becomes closer to sight.
Over the past few years, I have received a lot of advice that encourages me to keep my head shaken, unless I’m so honest and then “everything would be good for me.”
But I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 were still in school, led by Thatcher’s government’s negligence that literally let my class fall, I tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both being a local councillor as a government minister.
I have never hid my politics, nor have I been in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused in cases of my political positions and in which I do not agree with the current direction of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s movement, the only thing I would say is that while the country goes towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, companies and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy by questioning my loyalty to the party’s leader.
But, in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud of them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deny me to act according to what I consider the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an invicted Ayr puts on the head
The last two attempts may change a bit the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this little match of the Tenent Premier League.
Now they're heading the board and it's the only invicted team of the ten.
Finally it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, led the team to victory, and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
"Until now we're tested in our game and we're still invicted, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You have to admit that Ayr has benefited from the better opportunities than us."
The test on the 14th minute of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, set in front of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot pushed a wrong launch.
Climo increased the advantage of the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half-time, transformed a shooting into lonely, leaving the marker 17-5 in favour of the Ayr in rest.
But Melrose began well the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop for the serious injury that was suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in the padiol and, since the restart, Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowall trial, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took part in having a more player with a test by Bruce Colvine that wasn't consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for placing Climo when he didn't have the ball, McPjherson scored a test from the penalty line on the rear side of Ayr.
Climo marked, as it did almost since the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test from the local team.
Still Game’s protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears to be ready to enter the restaurant industry after discovering that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which writes and co-categories with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nine season will be the final, and Kierman seems to plan another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make comments, although a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow’s “nearest restaurant business”.
"The sea is ours": Interior Bolivia expects the court to go to the Pacific
The sailors saw a naval headquarters covered by appliances in La Paz.
The public buildings have a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are rejected by the slogan: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to recover."
In Bolivia without sea, the remembrance of a lost coast before Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict continues alive, as the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean again.
If these hopes are at their most challenging point for decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive breakdown," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see CIX’s judgment on giant screens across the country with the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce Bolivia’s complaint and that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Indian president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has a lot of play in Monday’s judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia the right, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to aid Chilean territory, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that CIX’s judgment came only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said the Chilean expert in international law, Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be delayed.
"The theme of sea access takes a lot of time blocked by the current Bolivia administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belgatory rhetoric underwent the good will that remained to him in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them afterwards.
The two countries have been pushing without exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in Hawaii, rejected the idea that the court would take an unusually fast decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile", and an opportunity to "find up 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits."
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Judge is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless you can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong said his nation would not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he could not trust Washington.
He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
I called on the United States to fulfil the promises made during a Singapore summit among its leaders.
This comment is produced at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that has been launched for more than three decades after the North Korean summit, Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is a "utopia" that the U.S. continuing sanctions and objections to a statement that ends the Korean War can double the North.
In Washington, they refuse to accept the statement without Pyongyang to take the first step towards disarmament.
Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is generalised skepticism that Pyongyang speaks seriously about giving up an arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion show reveals the last line of gigantic blacks that will soon be in the tents.
If you want to increase your collection of dark ones or get completely covered with the sun, do not look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the past a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that opened the audience with the most pure style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible dark ones filled Instagram this summer and these designers dropped her through their most surprising creations.
Valentino's main piece was a sharp bean hat decorated with a broad tab imiting pens that inundated the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized accessories were beaten sandals, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had the lips shaved and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the high sleeve.
One of the creations seemed to be a complete craftsmanship, with the glasses and the tube, and the other a frozen frozen cone.
And if you're a great fashion fan, you're lucky.
The fashionable people predicted that the giants could reach the tents.
The disproportionate shadows come just after the bomb, the 60-inch-down ball hat that leads the whole world, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has pulled out another great creation: a ball beach bag almost as large as the model that was swallowed with a bath tray that takes it.
The orange raffle bag decorated with raffle flocks and finished with a white leather ring, was the highlight piece of Jacquemus' summer collection 2019 La Riviera in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope that the dark and large beach bags will come to the tents next summer, since the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
The private schools of Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS) are striving to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored study plan, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, that's what you're talking about.
But if you speak to him in your own language, then reach the heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish relationships and confidence with people in other countries.
From the results of the recent exams of this year, we can see that languages are at the highest level of the table and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages gained an oversight.
The data, compiled from the 74 SCIS schools, show that 72% of the students received Mandarin honor, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved a remarkable degree.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private and all kinds of school programs.
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Training Commission in 2014 indicated that the lack of language knowledge represents 17% of the reasons for entrepreneurs to cover vacation.
Therefore, linguistic skills are increasingly essential to prepare youth for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, since there are more work opportunities than languages they need.
Regardless of the career you have chosen, you will learn a second language with a real advantage in the future with a life-threatening skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will place a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two figures, in this case 15%.
This is why it is so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children more opportunities to find a significant job.
In Scotland, teaching languages vary according to school.
Some schools are focused on the most classical modern languages, while others are delighted by the most important languages considered for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your children, private schools always have several languages to choose and specialist teachers in this field.
Scottish private schools are specialized in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills needed to triumph, whatever the future departs from them.
We cannot deny that in this moment, in a global business environment, languages remain vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait has almost ended for the searers who want to see LeBron James playing with Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The team coach, Like Walton, announced that James would play the initial match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to decide how many minutes it will play.
“It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, they asked James for his plans in advance of six Lakers matches.
At these heights of my career I don’t need pre-time matches to be ready,” he said.
Trump's election acts arrive in Virginia on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five half planned for next week, including stops in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a pause confirmation vote to cover his candidate’s vacation from the Supreme Court, Trump intends to receive support for the next half-mandate elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing Congress control when voted in November.
What time is Trump’s middle in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump's mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can see Trump's mitin in West Virginia following via YouTube live retransmission.
Trump will probably address the issue of the judgment held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become stressed by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and keeps Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of media is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impulse.
Therefore, these five media that Trump will give next week aim to "dynamize volunteers and sympathizers while Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is as important for his agenda that the president will travel as many states as possible in front of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who preferred not to be nominated told Reuters.
The midnight, which will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium, could gather the sympathizers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania" and get Pittsburgh media coverage, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month when Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the survey.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of Western Virginia, to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would you say the impulse is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they are four, so I suppose we take it as a bit of impulse," said Jordan Spieth while marching at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more in the game.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind in favor and a lot to animate, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth resulted deadly from tee to green and is preaching with the example.
They became stronger as they advanced their round, making a crucial put to match the fourth match when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
When he got the put that made them win the 15th game, he threw a similar beer, the type of beer that he thought the American team wasn't still out.
“You just have to concentrate and worry about your party,” Spieth said.
It's the only one left for these players now.
18 holes to get caught.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable Ryder Cup history.
The strange but lovely European couple has four and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and no last nine holes on Friday morning.
That journey, and the way it seems to flow its energy towards and from it, confirms them how rivals beat on Sunday, and there could not be more popular players to get a victory when the sun rises on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Speaking of European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dismissed Sergio García, the hero of the fourballs of the morning, when he embraced with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first trip ended with Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they were never near to leave.
But on Sunday there will be nobody to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely at the interactions between the couples, the tips they give, those they don't and the way they can change a strategy in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage over the last day, but this foursome session has also demonstrated that the Team has endured to fight, things some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe will take advantage of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods with difficulties to rise four points to the marker at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to preserve the trophy that was lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in foursomes, winning four matches, but couldn't cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points of the 12 individual matches on Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European invader to win four points followed by, while the Molinari, hired "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is the second couple to win four points in Ryder Cup history.
After shaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a denied Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with 5&4 more categories.
Woods, who disputed two matches on Saturday without regret or glory, showed occasional raffles of brilliance, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourball and foursome modes and five followers.
Justin Rose, who was resting on the fourballs in the morning, gathered as her partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, pushing a defeat in front of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe couldn't always win a pleasant brim day in the southwest of Paris.
The three times champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas fixed the point of reference for the Americans by achieving two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup where a team rises four points in individuals, although as the current holder of the troop, the Furyk team only needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a contra-attack on Sunday seems to be out of its reach.
North Cora no to unilateral disarmament if you don't have confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions increased their disobedience in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons under circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, dismantling nuclear test fields and committed to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the corresponding response by the U.S.,” he added.
Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first by our side."
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual denuclearization" under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took measures, its statement seemed important, as it did not refuse unilateral denuclearization as it happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to the "denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first deposit its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted to relax the hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its objective of forced effect, and even opposes the "declaration of the end of war"," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us axial is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions aggravate our inconfidence.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Nevertheless, he spoke about three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the “bad president” Trump called Kim “home rocket in a suicide mission.”
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened to "fully destroy" North Korea, voted Kim for its courage when taking measures to disarma it, but said there is still a lot of work to do and that the sanctions must be kept until North Korea disarmas.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time for it, and that it took two years, three or five months.
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The compliance of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the march of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
Pyongyang left Pyongyang in July saying it had been advanced, only a few hours after North Korea reported it for making "mafia demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to uninstall missiles, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the "coherent measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he requested were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students conduct a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep more in order to fight the growth of the Machiist culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
A scholar discovered that university students in the world number one often unknown the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a conversation about the impact that the lack of sleep had in learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this right now, in my last year?"
He said no one had spoken to him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of an hour involves a number of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee beans, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects the athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at the time of sleep.
In another section, inform participants of how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
“We know it won’t change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, in the same way we have the right to know what the health effects are if we opt for smoking tobacco,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to spend the whole night awake still exists. And it adds that modern technology and increasing pressure for students involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough and have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. Even avoid getting worried, as lack of sleep makes the brain enter into inanition mode, which makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course throughout the campus.
The next step, wait, is to request all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider the option of setting an alarm to sleep, as well as when they wake up. Similarly, it is recommended to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitting electronic screens and LED lighting, which may dibalance the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's homes
Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack re-released Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first home victory since the 4-1 triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team led to Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left its team at eight Hearts points, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before rest, and a line of Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that it was empathy.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston ascended to third place and is only behind the Hibernians with a difference goal.
And it could be much worse for the Rangers after Calum Spence's line judge had to have been treated by a wound on his head by supposedly throwing a object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that pulled the Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with Livingston’s same 11 who pulled him a point at Hearts last week and would have been charmed in the way his organized joint suffocated his opponents at all times.
The Rangers may dominate the possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in only two minutes when the short passage of Menga's first time sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's port, but the centercampist wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot from Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence companion, Alan Lithgow, only got crash in the second peace.
The Rangers took control, but they seemed to have more hope than convincing about their game in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that they would have asked penalty to 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless shocked, but the arbitrator, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian claims.
The Rangers made only two shots at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former guardmate, Liam Kelly, had only problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head stop and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute might have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for their hard work.
Rangers failed to face Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to choose Menga for a simple stop.
Gerrard acted in the rest while changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the zodiac made a move to Morelos, but impotent Kelly ran out of his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors when playing exactly the kind of game he likes, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting a long ball after another.
Holt's team might have expanded the advantage in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow came from the core.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, complained about another penalty when he was wrapped up with Jacobs, but Thomson made the look fat again.
Almanaque: the inventor of the counter Geiger
And now a page of our Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and CONTADO... was the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as Geiger counter.
A pear of science since then, Geiger’s accountant has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, such as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado” (“The Coronado Camps”), protagonized by those apparently insolite vacuum scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is that in the world?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When putting these headphones, the effects of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard.”
Evans: "Tell me, I'm sure you're stealing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that brings his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defect cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defect and kill cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize defect cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and return to injectable
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defect cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to several types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "impulses the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorrectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to immune cell extraction from patients and "learn them" to address cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launched a speech in favour of Trump using a MAGA chapel (Make America Great Again) in his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result wasn't good
During a Saturday Night Live program, they hit Kanye West in the studio after a confused presentation in which he elected U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would present himself as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the night's third song, called Ghost Town, in which she took a goat of Make America Great Again, criticized the Democrats and reiterated their support for Trump.
"I often speak with a white and say, 'How can you like Trump if he's racist?'
If I were worried about racism, I would have left the United States for a long time,” he said.
SNL started the program with a satira protagonized by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee on claims for sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it was not released, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's criticism to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to laugh at West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time in the rabbits due to his goat.
"They took care of me in the rabbits.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
Intimize us!
And then they said I was going to the pique," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick?", saying, "I'm going to use my superman gout, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love.”
His comments provoked punishments in the audience at least twice and SNL cast members seemed to be ashamed, told Variety, with the following witness that a person who was there gave the publication: “All the study remained in absolute silence.”
He was appointed West as the last substitute for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left a lot of people stunned with an interpretation of the song I love it, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received the support of the conservative group’s director, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: “For one of the most brave spirits: THANK YOU for making the front to the Mafia”
However, the presentation of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying West was simply "being who he is and that's completely amazing."
"So and all of this, I chose NOT to reward anyone (purchasing your music or clothing or supporting your "art") that I think you're embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Like us,” he added.
Before the show, the kidnapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "to be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Loading for murder attempts at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of a murder attempt after a man was shot at an eastern restaurant in Belfast on Friday.

The accused is expected to be present before the Court of Magistrates of Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the charges.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword management role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the Machiist hero stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen are translated into that it seems that young people to boys have to be hard to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something failed" and asked how to cope with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#EuTamen).
Kit, who recently married the co-protagonist of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel quite strong at this moment. Where are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He said, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be that particular part of being man?
I really think it’s one of the great questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, obviously, something went wrong with the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prejudice or sequence of Game of Thrones when the series arrives at its end next summer, claiming that "supply of horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will play a reposition of True West (The True West), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes his meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
"I knew my wife in this program, so in some way, she provided me with my future family and my life from here onwards," he said.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie’s family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted sexually, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has quickly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who suffered HIV in this way was virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in the meantime, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been discriminated against in China in 1997, but they say that discrimination against LGBT people has expanded.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will end up getting married to women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease prove to be inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to filter data from the Republican Party senators, "Dangerous lies" and "conspiring theories"
On Saturday, U.S. representative Maxine Waters rejected the allegations that a member of his staff had published personal information from three senators of the U.S. Republican Party on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democratic Democrat said the statements were made by websites and commentators of the "ultradereita".
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the disseminated information included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, headquarters of the U.S. government, during a Senate panel hearing on inadequate sexual behaviour charges against the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtering appeared a little after the three senators were questioned by Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a member of Waters staff, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfunded charge is completely false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent charges, was not responsible for any means of filtering this information.
This unfunded accusation is completely false and a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement promptly raised online criticism, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial was made angry," Fleischer wrote.
“He understands that he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone accuses him of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You should not question the causes of the accused.
It must remain apractable and quiet.”
It seemed like Fleischer was comparing Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of appearing too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who presented himself to bank Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's good if it's right," he shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said his department “warned the entities responsible for compliance with the law and the appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
“We will ensure that we discover the guilty,” he continued, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for everyone and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in Action), Rowan Atkinson's Powerless Spy Parodie
It is traditionally looking for Brexit's transcendence in new films from a British perspective and it seems that this can apply to the return of the franchise of this parish and action comedy of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironical satira be converted to the matter of the obvious stupid ones that we are in the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any way, Johnny English's incompetent jumping eye and rubber face renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-Anglophone cinematographic territories.
Of course, it is the foolish secret agent who, despite his striking claims of adulating glamour, has a little Clouseau, a chess of Mr. Bean and an anache of this kind that contributed with a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once interpreted in Barclaycard's now forgotten television ads, in which he seeds chaos at his step.
There are a couple of good moments at Johnny English's last exit.
I admire when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval armor tray and the rotor steps make a brief strike against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps to the sight, but gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" movies, such as 007 and Impossible Mission, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It looks like the mood has been directed to children rather than adults, and in my opinion Johnny English’s extravagant accidents are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s movies change when encarning Bean’s character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates the network of supersecret web spys in Britain and reveals the identities of all British agents in the area, for anxiety of the service agent, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the top for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who has already suffered a total crisis of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character almost looks like Theresa May, but you can’t do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform that as all the spys have committed themselves, they must take someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a professor in some snob institution, but gives extraofficial classes about how to become an infiltrated agent; here are some jokes, when English offers the Academy of Spy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency news session and meet with their former and suffered companion Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is slightly lost.
Because Batman and Robin from the mistakes of the Secret Service of Your Majesty come back to action, joining the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously undergoing the charm of the carismist multi-millonaire who claims that it can solve British computer problems: the sinner Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough initiate their odisee of ridiculous puzzles: dressed in chambers, take light to an outstanding French restaurant; create a tumulte that illegally puts them on board Volta’s luxury yate; and English triggers total anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality casks to familiarize themselves with Volta’s home.
Obviously, all arrests go out of their last sequence, but in the friendly and scandalous way that it is, it seems to be pulled out of a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, as happened to other Johnny English films, they couldn't avoid thinking: The British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes its talent just?
The Labour Party refuses to design a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make British work four days a week, but cover by five
In particular, the party wants employers to pass the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an additional free day.
This way, the employees would enjoy a weekend of three days, but they would continue to receive the same wage.
Sources say that the idea would "axusta" the party's economic agenda and its plans to inclinate the country for workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four days a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is hoped that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from day to night, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign for the general elections in 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not support the ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week does not enter the party’s policy and is not considered by this.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
Chancellor’s shadow plans also involve the possibility that current water companies shareholders do not recover their entire investment, as a labour government could carry out “deductions” due to perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed the plans to place workers in corporate councils and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of corporate shares from the private sector to employees, which embed dividends annually for up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh lasted at least a week with the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. The question is whether the department's findings could influence so that Republican senators withdraw their support.
On Sunday, in an interview, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could take light of something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his fellow in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"Let me go to the audience. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after the accusation came out and asked if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, round.”
Nevertheless, Graham's vote seems incomparable.
“My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied round," Graham added Christine Blasey Ford.
"The people mentioned were unable to check it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will welcome the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive star cartel that will act and an equally impressive mission, ending with world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people visiting the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the assistant audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as doing a volunteer, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other significant way to help create awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
But what is the achievement of the Global Citizen at 12 years of achievement of its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to ask for measures to be taken, or is it just another case of the so-called "clictivism", people who think mark the difference when signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, driving a set of different goals.
He claimed that these actions helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and advertisements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been repayed or recovered.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people from all over the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executives committed to "aid children to develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda $35 million to help end the malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizen tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and sympathizers of Global Citizen like you, we can convert social injustice of malnutrition into a history footnote," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition in the UK, the government announced funds for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "What makes you think we can end with extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen said: “It will be a long and difficult path and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But in the same way that happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve this, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are some of the two artists who will play at the event this year in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the navy to make a "blocking" to hinder energy exports from Russia, U.S. Interior Secretary announced
"If necessary," Washington can use the sea to prevent Russian energy from coming to markets, including the Middle East," U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s commitment in Syria, especially where it operates legal government instances, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe," he said.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the ways and means to face it.
“The United States, along with the sea, has the ability to ensure that the maritime roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that its energy does not go to the market,” he said.
Zinke thus addressed participants of the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called itself the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is treated the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, of exploiting and replacing fuel," he said, at the same time referring to Russia saying that "they have only a tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were conducted while Trump’s administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s administration officials, including the president himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, has converted Berlin into “activo” of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly recalculated that the $11 billion Nord Stream olive oil, which was established to double the capacity of the existing olive oil to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is argued only for economic reasons and is an example of unfaithful competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position received the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the U.S. to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state intersects in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, BDI president, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine her candidate for presidency in 2020, Senator Massachusetts said.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine her presidential nomination in mid-term elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and this includes a woman in power," The Hill said.
"On November 6, I will carefully examine my candidate for the presidency."
Warren thought about President Donald Trump during the public meeting, affirming that he was "leading this country for the wrong direction."
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was honest in his criticism to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet “of course a FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters did not believe it would appear in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the Senate would not submit her candidate, according to a survey from the Suffolk University's political research center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidate, with 38 percent support for a possible candidate and 48 percent support against.
Other prominent names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidate in 2020, including former Vice President Joe Biden, and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide it before January, the Associated Press agency said.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's Post-Raumatic Stress Disorder (TEPT) on Donald Trump's Myth
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering in September
Monday night, they were arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going on, what is going on again, I can see reflected in other families who feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the injuries with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience in a statement by Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that his arrest was a taboo theme and that his son and other war veterans, “return different, hardened, wondering whether there is respect for what militia and airline companions, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country.”
They were arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence on a woman, which was injured in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon at the same time being drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla police department.
18 states and District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in relation to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the district presented a court friendly report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the applicant's party's prosecution of Grace's Sessions v. which the American Civil Liberties Union (United States for Civil Liberties) presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her couple "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" had abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
Detective in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described Salvation, Honduras and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, such as nations facing generalized problems with criminal organizations and related domestic violence.
The U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to request asylum.
Columbus District Prosecutor General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition violates that principle," said the court's friend's report.
Taxists continued to discuss in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' entry gives the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide labor."
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and criminal organization violence.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to relieve all problems (including all serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubled in a career to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly worse.
“The circumstances are very stressful,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever baby at the evacuation center of the city of Palu.
“Every minute there’s an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is small."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed houses, collecting their denied belongings, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damned by the earthquake of 7.5 size, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replies.
The bags filled her eyes as she explained how the violent earthquake felt kicked out the hotel’s room on the fifth floor she shared with her wife and her daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
"The ruins of the wall have broken me," Haris told Associated Press, and added that her family was in a vow in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of abuse with "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published an announcement of four-pages in an American newspaper preaching the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, referred to the China Daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, the Iowa state’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of intermittent in the U.S. Congress elections, which will take place on November 6, as China denied.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the U.S. elections, marked what officials in that country had seen at Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to cooperate with China.
Although it is normal that foreign governments publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the leveling of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the U.S., China’s compensatory tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa’s ex-government, one of China’s leading agricultural products exporters, said Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and American entrepreneurs.
In an article of opinion written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, China "is intensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press."
“Under spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press when publishing a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at the press station located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few disidential voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese may have about the worrying economic trajectory of China, as the media are under the firm wing of the Chinese Communist Party," he said.
He also states that “one of China’s most important newspapers declined the offer to publish” his article, although he did not confirm which newspaper was discussed.
Kavanaugh’s disaster causes women’s republican vote to lose in a few days after half-mandate elections
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, candidate to the Supreme Court, despite the various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn a violent reaction, especially the female voters, in the next half-mandate elections.
The reactions to these charges were numerous and the majority of Republicans were positioned to continue with the vote.
"These things can't be distracted," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse in an article published on Sunday at The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubts that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation is enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday, as well as they won't forget it in a near future or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national spokesman of the MoveOn progressive group, said on Friday in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, opponents, the flu of "Approach November!", manifested themselves in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's witness, said Mic.
“The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will overcome any expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's already high,
But it is still more important, especially among the uncertain voting women in the outskirts or those between the ages of 18 and 29, that although they don't like the President, they don't usually go to the urnes."
Before Ford's public witness detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidates, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans continued to confirm it.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, said in the early days of the week on the NBC News channel.
"This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will sit in the bank of the accused or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps in the election of Democrats in the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided into believing the witness of Ford or Kavanaugh, although they tend to support the latter more.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the surveyed people fully or probably believe Ford’s witness, in front of 35% supporting Kavanaugh’s witness.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, in front of 30% who thinks the same as Ford.
Due to Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s charges, as well as at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified to the Senate Judicial Committee under a vow that Kavanaugh attacked in a state of drunkness when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed the genitals at a college party when it was studying in Yale at the age of 80.
World Wide Web Creator wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of this technology legend, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee had the chance that the intention of Inrupt was "dominating the world".
"We have to do it," he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data mask" or POD.
You can include contact lists, lists of pending tasks, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data warehouse unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company qualify for this as a "personal emigration through the data".
Inrupt’s idea, according to his President John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security company owned by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from all over the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee argued that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about introducing or not a complete change that would change your business models from day to day.
"We don't need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new Solid-based web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been raised as an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic with this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Homenase Bernard Vann, clergy condecored with the Cross of the Victoria in the First World War
The only clergy of the Church of England who was condecored with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War received a posthumous homename in its native city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and reverent Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was murdered by a firearmsman four days later without knowing that he was authorized by the largest British military condecoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a commemorative monument in their honor at a defile in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, highlighted the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandmother's farm who deserved the title.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann addressed his batallion on the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a dense nebula and under the juice of an intense fire of meters".
Later she hurried to get to the fire line and, with a "great braveness," she drew the front line before she climbed with a canon and without anyone's help, and threw three people from the enemy departure.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was murdered by a German shooter on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandmother’s actions are “something he could never live, but a lesson still like that.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a flower crown after the show, heading the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said to feel "I am honored to participate in the show" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the role to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you take the whole night smart to enjoy the full Bellator 206, and when the best part arrives something hot prevents.
San Jose's cartel included 13 battles, being six of the main, and was being retransmitted live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were going to see the faces, the UK spectators were overwhelmed when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some of them didn’t impress after spending so many smart hours waiting to see the fight.
A fan described the change of these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
"The state legislation ruled that that content was not suitable for 6:00 a.m., and for this reason it had to change the child programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, when asked for the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said he would take the UK audience into account in future programming.
“I think we can be soluble when we think of the repetition,” Coker said.
“But if it’s six in the morning there, we can’t solve it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I started receiving many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying soluble because we thought it was a technical error.
But it was a government problem.
I promise it will not happen again.
We will limit five fights instead of six. We want to give the maximum to our fans, but let's pass and
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lower due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, says he has risen feeling less than the whole world because of his sexuality, but this has made him find the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he arrived at the school.
Guest of the first broadcast of the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, explained that he began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of this program, is low by disease.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that children and girls liked."
He also said: “Today, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength needed to achieve success.”
I wanted to prove that it was "someone" so that people don't feel disappointed when they discover their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in the Australian Commonwealth Games to ask more countries to deplete homosexuality.
She decided to talk because she felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said to fall in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was “a whole surprise.”
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years of difference between them had never been a problem.
"When you live so much in such a short time" (with only 14 years of age you first participated in the Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of your age who experienced similar altitudes.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley's father didn't accept she was going to die, and one of the last things he asked her son was one ticket to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
“I don’t think I’d say I wouldn’t be here to occupy that first row,” Daley shared.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and it was at that moment, at the moment of her death, when I realized that it was really not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
At this moment they knew that that was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling.”
The choice of Heather Small's Proud song is also not in van, as it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still puts his hair on the top.

A low-shaped Mickelson ended at Ryder Cup bank on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his technique so that this does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participated in the 12th biennial event, stayed in the bank by Captain Jim Furyk's decision and could not participate in the fourballs or Saturday's foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, as many other times in the United States, the champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although it has never been the most precise of the players, even at the time of their career, at the age of 48 it does not fit in the Le Golf National, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if this wasn't enough, Mickelson faced Sunday's ninth match with precise Francesco Molinari, British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below starting the 12 individual matches, start with good foot, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted his husband, even though he couldn’t say much more.
"I understood perfectly the role I played today, gave me a palm on my shoulder, passed my arm and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk shared.
“I fully trusted myself.
It has a prominent place in the Fame Hall and has contributed a lot to teams last week and this week.
He probably didn’t think he played two games.
I thought it would play more, but at the end, that’s how things were, and that’s how we thought it should be.
Like everyone, she wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo's record in the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup.
She could mark the end of her career at the Ryder Cup, a career that has never reached the level of her individual palmares.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halfs, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intact to the team.
"It's a funny, sarcastic person, with understanding and likes to get together with people, it's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
“I like to see how well the youngest players spent this week.
It's a lot more with a good player."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn fears the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup individuals can easily become a disturbed journey.
The Grand Dance debuted in 1997 at a match in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over Americans, but they finally reached the target line with a minimum advantage winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
"You still think we had a great advantage in Valderrama; just as in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won for little," Bjorn reflected in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion winning 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story shows that this has not yet finished.
Tomorrow we have to go through all.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
Our goal is to win that troop, and we have to focus on it.
I'm not tired of saying that, I'm focused on our 12 players on our side, but I'm also very conscious of what's on the other side: the best players in the world."
Enchanted by the performance of his players in a hard golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we face the other beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and we must also prove our value.
It's great to be with a companion next to when things go well, but when you face things individually, then try to prove your ability as a golfer.
This is the message you need to transmit to players, who take the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your companion behind, and he must also take the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek that his players have a better individual performance than his companions, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points.
Furyk himself was on two ends of these rounds of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but ending as a loser of the European miracle trail in Medinah."
"I remember each of the damned words," he replied when asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, met the players face to face on the last day.
“We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the impulse goes in a direction, there is a lot of pressure in the intermediate matches.
We prepare our alignment with this in mind and put the players as it seemed to us, we want to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task to try to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and the other Europeans, Ian Poulter, in the top half of the ranking.
"I decided this order because I think it covers all the way," Bjorn explained about his selection for individuals.
Germany's new warship is postponed again
The newest fragrance of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not arrive at least next year due to defect systems and increasingly cost, local media reported.
The post in service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fragrance vessel, was goodbye until the first half of 2019, a military spokesman told the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the subsequent problems of delivery affected the destiny of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels, which the Navy charged in 2007, will replace the former Bremen class fragrance.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, with different antiereal missiles and antiboats, as well as with hidden technology, such as reduced radar, infrareds and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deflect the newer fragrances up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well pointed out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that will allow Germany to project its power in the foreign country, will be old when they enter service.
The unfortunate F125 was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss estate in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a boat to a builder after the delivery.
Few of the reasons behind this return were known, but the German media spoke of "clusive defects in software and hardware" that imposed the use of the warship in a fighting mission.
The software defects were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of 120 navals; that is, half of the staff needed in the former Bremen class fragrances.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add improvements in the future.
It is believed that Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons twice as much as the ships of similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defect hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew formation, is also becoming a problem.
It is claimed that it already reaches the amazing amount of €3100 million, compared to the initial €2200 million.
The problems of the newer fragrance pay special attention to the light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is making water.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the Navy is staying without ships capable of disarming.
The officer claims that this problem is increasing, since old ships were removed, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the fragrances of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join Mariña.
National Trust Spy the Secret Life of the Pieces
A new research that is being carried out in a finnish of Highlands in Scotland aims to reveal how pieces use the landscape to seek food.
It is hoped that results will shine light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the pieces’ activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of the sound by experts from all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the pieces and that each species is doing.
A map of habitat will then be developed to create a detailed image of the landscape scale of your behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show that habitat areas are more important to the pieces and how they use each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of landscapes and which is the best way to maintain forests for pieces and other associated species.
The population of pieces in Scotland and throughout the UK declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and the loss of living.
Aerogenerators and aluminum also assume a risk, as well as traps with sticking for mosquitoes, some chemical treatments of construction materials and domestic cat attacks.
The pieces are not blind,
But because of her night hunting habits, her ears are more useful than her eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the pieces very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodically surveys, children's inspections, and occasionally even rescues.
The organization has even the unique and first reserve of Scottish pieces in Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of Scottish pieces.
David Thompson, State Manager, says that this is the ideal territory for them.
“In Threave we have a great area for pieces,” he says.
"We have ancient buildings, historical trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things that we don’t yet know about the pieces, so the work we do here and other properties will help us understand better what they need to prosper.”
It emphasizes the importance of controlling the presence of pieces before performing maintenance tasks in the property, as it is possible that the unwanted destruction of a single child of maternity may kill up to 400 females and nurses, which could destroy all the local population.
The pieces are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill them, slander them, or disturb them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
“There is still a lot left to learn about the pieces and, in the case of many species, we don’t know how it’s going to their populations.”
Ronaldo disregards rape claims and his lawyers are ready to appeal to German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo qualify for rape complaints against him as false, claiming that the only thing people want is to know using his name.
His lawyers will appeal to German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these charges.
The front of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 so that she wouldn't say anything about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33, hit this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, accounting 142 million followers.
"No, not a thousand times no.
What is said today is false,” the five-time winner of the Golden Ball said before the camera.
"People want to know each other using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous by saying only my name is part of my work.
They're a happy and respectable man," the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to appeal Der Spiegel for allegations, which qualify as “a unacceptable statement of suspicion in the privacy area” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would ask for compensation for "moral damages for a amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident would have occurred in June 2019, in a suite at Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After having met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly violated her, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, was asserted that he was a 99 percent horseman, but that that 1% would betray him.
The documents affirm that Ronaldo confirmed that both maintained sexual relations consented by both parties.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt frightened by the represals and was worried about the public screw.
The 34-year-old woman said she was seeking to revoke the deal while continuing to be traumatised by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Car manufacturers would leave the UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as a world leader in automotive manufacturing by bringing Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
It is worrying that Toyota UK at the BBC stated that Britain would leave the EU without an agreement, temporarily suspending the production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“It is necessary to reach an agreement,” Clark added.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit failed to reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost workplaces.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for producing the Auris and Avensis Toyota models, produced last year about 150,000 vehicles, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will be witnessing how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of automotive manufacturers is the risk of supply chain in case there is no Brexit agreement.
Toyota’s production line is very customized, every 37 minutes there are parts from UK and EU suppliers for customized cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and could be delayed and deficiency.
The company says it would be impossible for Toyota to keep a normal pace for more than one day at the Derbyshire plant, so the production would have to stop.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "accurately calibred to avoid such controls at the border."
"It is essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, so that you can enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity," BBC Radio said.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long the production would be stopped, but he warned that in the long run the cost would reduce the competition of the plant and could even cost workplaces.
Peter Tsouvallaris, Burnaston’s employee for 24 years and Union coordinator of Unite, said that his members are increasingly worried: “For experience, I know that once these work disappear, they never return.
A government spokeswoman said they presented a precise and cribable plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be again
The White House said Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and the deputy secretary of justice Rosenstein could be late a week later due to the fight for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special attorney Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, the ties between Russian and Trump assistants, and the possible obstacle to justice by the president.
Whether Trump releases the adjunct prosecutor, or if he does not, which threatened Mueller’s independence, feeded the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of destituting the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among reports that indicated that he was at the peak of resignation.
On the other hand, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not have to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a shock with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accusing him of inappropriate sexual behaviour.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation to the FBI on complaints against Kavanaugh, which lasted even more the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
In front of the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: “There is still no fixed date, it could be this week or another week, given all that’s going on at the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press to be informed.”
Some journalists questioned this claim, since Sanders took from September 10 without celebrating a press role.
When Chris Wallace asked the reason,
Sanders claimed that the lack of information session was not due to an averaging to the reporters' greatness, although he said he would not be the one who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president gives more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he has not cited any source to evaluate the data.
They will continue to hold information meetings, Sanders said, but he insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the U.S. President, that's much better than to ask her questions.
You are witnesses of how we have been doing this over the past few weeks, and this will replace a press role in which you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open press sessions or conferences with dignity visitors.
However, the press conferences in loneliness are poor.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the reason this week in New York, with a free appearance and strange occasions in the meetings of journalists.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the animosity before Brexit
The Health Secretariat sent a letter to EU workers at the Scottish NHS in which it expressed its gratitude and communicates its desire to stay in the country with Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has committed to covering the costs of status applications covered for EU citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are planned to end this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, also intensified its preparations for a possible non-consensus situation.
I know this is a period of inquiry for everyone.
That is why I would like to repeat the value of the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and more, provide an unquestionable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers, was undergone an emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury during Saturday defeat in front of Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State coach, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the rest.
Looks like, desmaiouse when reaching the band line.
The trainers and the medical staff gave you oxygen on the band line before taking it in camile to carry out a subsequent evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician told Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville (Tennessee), that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also stated that there are no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tickets in total on Saturday before leaving the game, which raised its total of the season to 18.
A timbre tax shall be applied to foreign buyers buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will charge a higher timber tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help people without their homes under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize Corbyn’s campaign’s success to attract young voters
Increased taxation will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without homes. Theresa May will pay you a higher tax when you buy a property in the UK.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign’s success to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high income.
The increase in tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money recorded will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The charge, which applies to the current timber tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second housing and purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
Facenda expects the change to get up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13% of new buildings in London are marketed by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulties to access the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “Pantsma cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for the application of a cash transfer tax cut to help new people buy their first home.
She accused the major builders of maintaining the high prices of housing by purchasing soil and not using it, and urged Ms May to eliminate the percentages of tax revenue on moderate price houses to arrange the "shame of the housing sector" living in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for reforms relating to the housing, including the control of the renters and the ban on challenges in which the renter does not blame.
He also wants to give greater powers to the municipalities in the construction of new housing.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream: life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, it is necessary to arrange the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it results in equal simplicity for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to sell homes rather than for British workers residents.
Too many people, the dream of being owners of a house is too far, and the indignity that does not assume to have a roof is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland’s manager Jack Ross said his “last ambition” was to become Scotland’s selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scotland is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwest club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and that was all,” Ross told the BBC Sportsound program in Scotland.
“I grew up seeing playing Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when he was a child, something they always wanted to live.
But this opportunity will only come if I have successfully directed a club.”
Among the predecessors of Ross in the position of Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he has not felt any worried about the success of those figures in such a large club after rejecting previously Barnsley and Ipswich Town proposals.
Will the success for me depend on the moment I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly own of a Premier League club,” he said.
“It won’t be a simple task, but you’ll probably just think I’ve succeeded here if I can return the club to Premier.”
Ross only takes three years as a coach after a Dumbarton assistant period and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
During that period he helped Alloa recover from the downfall to the third division and succeeded St. Mirren to be on top of the downfall to win the championship title the next season.
Ross claims to feel more comfortable now than ever found during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I probably found myself in a real enclosed," he remembered, taking charge of Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds rare because it wasn't bad to me, I reasonably gained good life and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to overcome every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like training.
I always enjoyed training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a painting is 17:30 a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but it put more pressure on restaurants chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent growth during July, but consumption in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's commercial advisory board for compiling the figures, said: "The light days and England's remaining in the world in football for longer than the expected resulted that in July a pattern similar to June, where pubs enjoyed a 2.8 per cent greater increase in consumption, although they suffered a restaurant.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in the restaurant’s sales volume in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the best results with higher consumption increases than experienced reductions by restaurants.
The pubs specialized in meals also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurants operators.
It looks like people just want to go out to drink.
In controlled pubs and bars the consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the meal was reduced by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of the RSM company for the analysis of leisure and hospitality activities, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that comes from the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in consumption outside the house.
It is not surprising that restaurants groups continue to suffer, however a fall of 4.8 per cent annually will be particularly painful if it is associated with the continuous increase in costs.
The hot and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for restoration businesses and the weather will be responsible for saying whether the moderation of temperatures experienced during August will provide so much breath for the sector."
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects slowdown in brand launches.

One in five children (some only 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "Fake Insta"
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexually transmitted content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents.
One in five children (some only 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey conducted to 20,000 secondary students showed an increase in the number of accounts of "Fake Insta" (in reference to the social network of Instagram photo exchange).
This news has led to an increase in fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a softened “main” account to show their parents while they had other private.
A mother who met with the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked her to "violation".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that there are so many teenagers tried to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish athletics federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from their incorporation to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I have a lot of desire to be a spokesperson for athletes and I hope to be able to contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic golds and currently working as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered an apoplexy a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and until I graduated.
It was an excitement work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned how to walk and currently I do asylum exercises.
"Thank you for your mood messages."
An announcement of a breast milk extractor compared to women with cows divides public opinion on networks
A breast milk extractor company shared public opinion on networks with an advertisement in comparison to breastfeeding women with cows that are moving.
In order to announce the release of the announced "first silent portable maternal milk extractor in the world", Elvie published an ironic ad in the style of a musical video to demonstrate the freedom that the new milk extractor offers to women.
Four real women dance in a cave full of foolishness for the cows at the rhythm of a song with the following letters: "Yes, beat me myself, but I don't have the coat" and "If you don't know, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The coro continues: "Muxe, muxe, I'm feeding babies, muxe, muxe, I'm moving my friends."
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused problems on the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions among the spectators. Many of them claimed that this puts in manifest the "horrows" of the dairy sector.
"Using cows to advertise this product was a very medium decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case we stole their children days after giving birth,” he said.
The Elvie milk extractor can be placed discreetly within a maternal subjector (Elvie/nai)
Another spectator commented: "Obviously traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But if, why don’t they use to announce a milk extractor for the mothers who remain with their babies?”
Another spectator added the following: "I announce with so little touch."
Other spectators defended the ad, even a woman claimed that the song seemed "my funny".
“It seems like it’s a great idea.
If he was still breastfeeding, he would buy one.
Get my milk off made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is slightly fired, but it interprets as a joke.
It looks like a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad directed to women who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement to eloqueze or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with discrete extractors inserted into their subjects.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted in a maternal subjector, which gives women freedom to move, submit their babies and even get out there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s creative partner and executive director, commented: “Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative release.
By describing the existing paralysis between women and cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges that involves while showing in a fun and closer way to the incredible sense of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This isn't the first time Elvie extractor takes the heads of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures threw on the coast for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased although the monthly number of border crosses remains relatively unchanged, partly due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, which have made it difficult to allocate patterns for children.
Traditionally, most of the patterns were also immigrants without papers and were afraid to put their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that possible models and other adult members of their homes would have to send their digital traps and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior office of the U.S. immigration and customs control service, testified to Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who asked for the release of minors without company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of people who are fathered or are part of the home are found in the country illegally, and most of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
That is why we will continue to pursue those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In order to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court before it spent a month since their detention instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear via video conference instead of in person to try to legalize their case in front of a immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they remain under custody, the more likely they become anxious or depressed, which may cause violent kidnapping or attempts to escape according to refugee workers and system reports published in the past months.
The lawyers claimed that these fears are increasing in centers of larger dimensions such as Tornillo, where there are more likely symptoms that a child is going wrongly going unrecognized due to their size.
They also suggested that moving children into the camp area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to dismiss friends could assume a trauma that many still suffer.
Syria calls for U.S., France and Turkey’s occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, headed to the UN General Assembly, also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s war is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also occupies the position of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were found in Syria illegally, with the pretext of fighting against terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without conditions," he said.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions of them had to escape from their homes.
He also said that Damascus would continue to fight this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories from terrorist groups and "with all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Syrians opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the theme of the refugees, Moualem declared that they were given the right conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for the "diffusion of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We use the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They’re politicing or what should be a mere humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is made to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib's last large rebel bastion allowed to continue with political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which there are three million people.
However, Moualem emphasized that the deal had "clear limit dates" and expressed his hope that the military actions will have the Shihadists, including the Al-Nusra front soldiers linked to Al-Qaeda, that "will be erradicated".
The U.N. Staffan de Mixa is hoping to gather the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate elections.
Moualem exposes the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, claiming that the body's work should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would be able to reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberals are waiting for, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
It would be "the most dramatic end of a presidency."
There are currently no signs of tiredness among observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience indexes have multiplied by more than two, reaching 1.05 million spectators at CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million first-time spectators, an increase of 1.7 million compared to Nielsen four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program led cable channel audience indexes with 3.5 million spectators during the nights in which important news occurred.
“It’s like a light that attracts people because it’s dealing with something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, a drama showrunner for ABC “Designated Survivor”, who talks about a secretary of the ministerial office who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
It reminds me of a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"He replied, 'Because he makes me laugh,' I said to Ms Scovell.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Obviously, unlike everything else that appears on television, the Washington posts can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if immigrant families can come back together and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can allow themselves.
Still, I suppose something that will be beyond a citizen being informed about spending six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing about Bob Woodward's use of "anonimous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar-bomber skin jacket Mr. Paul Manafort ("a full dress of arrogance", Trump's statement of the Washington Post emancipated

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, I was sunning and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the northern coast of Kauai, but I was closed at the house seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to deploy while Brett Kavanaugh was at the point of facing the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging out.
"I remember when we were doing all these programs so stupid at that time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External money reaches out to finance candidates to the House for half of the legislative elections
It is not surprising that the 17th congress district of Pennsylvania is receiving a large cash flow due to the reorganization of a congress district with two representatives in positions in the career to occupy the same position.
This district located in the Pittsburgh forests which was recently reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is present against another representative in office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superseded over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that Republicans would manipulate the electoral circumscription of the ancient districts in their favor.
The election career in the new 17th congress district dismissed a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congress Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a victorious victory in the March special elections for the 18th congress district of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed a wide follow-up.
This position was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in the district by 20 points.
Political experts give Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States appreciated the possibility of punishing O Salvador for its support to China and then started back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama would already recognize Beijing, with little response by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even had a hotel in Panama until his partners voted for the Trump Organization’s leadership team.
Officials of the State Department decided to order back to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of O Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," according to Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the Department in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against O Salvador, which received about $140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and restrictions in visa, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the celebration of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important officials of the administration made it clear that they wished the conference to advance, effectively ending any possibility of sanctions for the Savior.
It is scheduled for Vice President Mike Pence to direct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a symptom of the importance of the administration, diplomats said.
The three American messengers returned discreetly to O Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal discussions always and when the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
His accounts were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration and he also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity is preserved.
Study History
The next negative case could be the report of special adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, as there are currently abundant evidence in the public file.
According to him, Mr. Mueller is also aimed at his investigation to discover whether Mr. Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to make accounts in that body, just when you have to prepare for the elections, and maybe you will eventually have to face a popular jury.
They are many inconscient and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall be inevitable, just as his European colleagues.
We all have to make decisions on the two sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup of state against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of murders that occurred later.
The course of history rotates around those points of inflexion, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or backward.
Americans are facing several of these moments of inflexion.
What will we do if Mr. Trump releases the State Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein took the water to the neck since the newspaper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapable of posting.
Mr. Rosenstein said the information from The Times was uncertain.
"How do we respond if the investigation that F.B.I. has just been requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not impartial, or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite criminal accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in half legislative elections for a Congress that requires responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who also occupied my house, who was aware of the embassy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to arrest Shabat’s candles on that table that included a squash.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic in the future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic to meet the Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive match achieved in Spain against the Villarreal this month, would place them in a very favourable position to be classified in the G Group of Europe League.
A injury in the cheon prevented the center camper Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 match against the Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, since Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“We got into the party thinking we can get something positive and get a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but, in general, empathy is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were higher.
The next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope we can reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last match, but with the support of our audience, I am sure we can fight for a positive result.
Last year was hard among all that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the boys are good and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, to forget the past season and to succeed.”
Women worry about savings for their joy
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had clear how they wanted to take care of them, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide claimed that they commented with their pairs the cost that assumed prolonged care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about the topic.
"People want her to take care of a family, but they are not taking the necessary measures to have that conversation," Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Department of Life Insurance, said.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t communicate your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family to agree where and how to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your adviser may also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the funding options for long-term care is a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, as long as you have money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a healthcare representative to designate a trusted person to monitor your healthcare and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are not sex-able to communicate with you.
It also values the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your invoices are paid if you are incapable.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your parents or older parents have a medical emergency and go to the hospital.
Would you be in condition to answer questions about your drugs and allergies?
Note this information in detail in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just the financial issue in the game, but who are the doctors who care about it?” asked Martin.

A man receives several shots with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man got multiple shots with a compressed air rifle while traveling home after leaving the night.
The victim, for 40 years, was found in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she got shots in her chest, abdomen, and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 (British Summer Time) as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
Their wounds are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cutting of the communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala recession, a northern area of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Célebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Célebes, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379.800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a reception located along more than 300 km off the coast northwest of the island of Célebes.
This region, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299.200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy in the province of Central Célebes, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Célebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located on the high-seizmic Pacific lumen cylinder, which regularly suffers earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered over the past few years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes affected the western coast of Sumatra by the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the south of Xava, Indonesia's most populated island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake was produced near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake affected the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of people and caused the death of about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's recession in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction caused by earthquakes and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: There were significant earthquakes on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of which on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily removed.
Sarah Palin’s elderly son is arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate to vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29-year-old was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for suspicion of a domestic violence crime, to prevent a complaint from being filed for domestic violence and for resistance to the authority, according to a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a girlfriend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, the police took her phone.
Palin remains in preventive jail in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility’s dependencies with a $500 fine, according to KTUU.
He stood before the judge on Saturday, in which he declared himself "non-innocent, since then" when asked, he reported to the prison.
Palin faces three smaller A-type crimes, which means he could enter prison for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of a smaller type B crime, a day sentenced to prison and a fine of $2,000.
This isn’t the first time they are making criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, preventing a complaint from being filed for domestic violence and possession of armed forces in the country in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of having a puppy on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to post-raum stress disorder syndrome that suffers after serving the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
At least 384 deaths were reported after the earthquake that affected the island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and be sure that the balance of deaths increases over the course of the days.
The earthquake occurred just in front of Central Célebes, in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Yacarta.
Videos are circulating through social networks where the moment of impact is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a rarely applied death penalty for suspicion of a terrorist attack in New York City
The federal tax authorities are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike ride at the West Side Highway Avenue in Lower Manhattan, following the life of people and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, tax authorities will have to demonstrate that Saipov "intensively" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries "intensively", according to the report of the intention of a death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two crimes involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov an accusation of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with a group of organized crimes, practice commonly used by the tax cases of organized crimes, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required a "notable planning and premeditation", the tax collectors declared by describing how Saipov carried out the "atmospheric, cruel and depraved" attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" according to the statement of charge.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the Southern District of New York does not process a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder of two drug traffickers, but finally sentenced to perpetual chain in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being conspired to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated lack of regret for the days and months after the attack, according to the court’s documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov declared to the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of ISIS he viewed on his phone according to the charge.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He has not been accused of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the two federal lawyers responsible for representing Saipov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the charge decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt with permanent chain without the possibility of withdrawal will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team has previously asked tax authorities not to request the death penalty.
A parliamentary tory says Nigel Farage should be placed in front of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised "mobilize a "People Army" today during a protest at the tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said that politicians had to “feel pressure” of the Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May's parliamentary members suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Usually, Mr. Peter Bone said at the Birmingham demonstration that the United Kingdom “was already leaving” the EU if Mr. Farage was the secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile the split lines of her party remained evidence when the favourable Tories joined the EU with an independent protest against the Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of its Chequers plan between the brexit, opponents and EU attacks.
His allies insisted that he continues to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone said in the concentration of the Leave Means Leave movement of Solihull that he wanted to end the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been informed to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If we were in charge of him, we would already be outside the EU at this time,” he said.
Wellingborough’s parliamentary member added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
As he demonstrated his opposition to the EU, he said: “We are not fighting world wars to serve.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone denied the suggestions that indicated that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people had changed their idea and wanted to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Tories member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also went to the march, since he said to reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers’ plan does not enjoy popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among our party and our activists who, to start, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their work when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage said in the concentration that it is necessary to make politicians "uncomfortable" that they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is currently a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we’re meeting today to tell them that we won’t let them leave with theirs.”
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, she added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit and that will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of staying in the EU made a walk through Birmingham before celebrating a two-hour concentration in the city center.
Several activists posted pancards with Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) after the group's post started this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives for security issues that suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“This is the people who tell us to have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without frictions, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously or present himself to the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider her presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats talked about their future on Saturday during a municipal meeting in a western Massachusetts town.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, is going to present the reelection in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-president of Trump’s campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It focuses on speculations that put her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its voters using the format of the municipality since Trump took the presidency.
An assistant asked if he was planning to meet the president.
Warren said that it was the time that “women are going to Washington to solve our government’s problems, and for that, a woman fails in the presidency.”
The death toll of Sims, the LSU player, was detained
Baton Rouge police, The Angels, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU's basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, in a press role held at 11:00 (east time).
They will post a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man out of the pictures.
Sims, 20-year-old, was murdered by black shots near the Southern University campus on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a ball wound in his head and finally died as a result of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday through 247 sports.
Wayde asked to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to be present in the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and placed under custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2 meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 reboots per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton joins the world title thanks to team orders, allowing him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since Valtteri Bottas ranked in front of Lewis Hamilton or Saturday that Mercedes team orders would be decisive in the career.
Bottas, who left the pole, had a good exit and almost left Hamilton only while defending her position during the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack her teammate.
Vettel first entered boxes and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped boxing once later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton further after several wheeled maneuvers that caused Ferrari’s driver to leave free from bad gain the inner risk of being late after a double defensive maneuver in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the outlet grid and moved to the seventh square at the end of the first round on its 21th anniversary day.
He then led his career during a large portion of this gratitude to which he preserved his tyres to be able to go faster at the end and forward Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth position.
Finally he entered boxes in turn 44 but couldn't get any position in the last eight rounds, which ended with Raikkonen on the fourth square.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job throughout the weekend and was a real rider.
The team made an extraordinary job to get the first two squares,” Hamilton said.
An inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act celebrated on Saturday for his insistence to affirm that he did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, candidate to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
In a speech conducted in an act in Western Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the witness given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that the people were "miserable, repugnant and liar".
“The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, when you see indignation, when you see people who are angry and who are miserable, repugnant and liar,” he said.
“When you see these posts and filters and they say, ‘Oh, I don’t fun.
I don't have fun."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you filtered?
Remember your answer... have you filtered the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't play.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter in which the charges against Kavanaugh made in July and filtered by Ford in early September, but Feinstein refused the filtration from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't filter her story," Feinstein commented to the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
"Pedium to keep your confidentiality and do what you asked me."
But his rejection seemed not to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: “Tell me that the body language was not correct.
You may not filter it, but you used the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of inadequate sexual behaviour by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to recover power through any necessary means.
They are evil and rejecting, no matter who damage, who have to atrophel to recover power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars repaired the defeat suffered on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the match back by 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an early advantage through two goles Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie joined the local set before Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard hit Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to ride to win Dundee for 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three victories before the prol of the Giants.
Dwyer’s initial goal was produced at 3:35 minutes thanks to Kendall McFaull’s assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after David Rutherford’s assistance.
In an early period, Sullivan regained the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to mark the match goal at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants would go on the marker before the first rest when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The local team responded, and Bouchard regained the game with a goal by power play in minutes 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to advance Dundee for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and secured the victory through their team's fifth goal in the last half of the period.
The Giants, now losing four of their last five matches, will play their next match at Milton Keynes, which will be held on Friday.
An air traffic driver dies to make sure hundreds of passengers can escape an airplane’s earthquake
An Indonesian air controller was considered a hero after he died to make sure an airplane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely land.
The balance of the dead is 800 and there are many disappearances after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Force replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people who are trapped under the cakes of the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri de Palu airport, which was violently balanced.
He remained in his position to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the outlet at the time, could safely displace.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokeswoman Johannes Sirait said that this decision could allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia’s ABC News channel said.
We prepare a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Remember our heart when we learn,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the death balance may be of thousands and the country's disaster management agency claimed that access to cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance of victims is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the cascals and many of them have not been reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency said.
Waves of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral will be celebrated on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying help and lives.
Laza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
drinking water is short.
“People are drawing the minimums.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they are going to be there.
This is a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "Give everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" she told CNN.
Indonesia had previously suffered earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini says there is a disappearance after an airplane accident in a lake
The airline operating an airplane that flew on a lake in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing after he previously claimed that 47 passengers and crew would leave the plane that was being flooded without incidents.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working together with authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
The boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the airplane crash against the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events continues without being clear.
Both the U.S. Navy and the airline confirmed that the plane landed on the lake before arriving on the landing track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane has passed along the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American nationality passenger, commented that he entered in very little height.
“It’s something extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers were able to move forward between the water that reached them to the belt until the emergency exit of the plane that was being flooded.
He also remembered that the flight assistants were beating and terrified, and that he suffered a mild wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors working near the place on a pearl’s improvement tasks also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the plane was approximately 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in airline accidents recorded in New Guinea in the last two decades, but nobody affected Air Niugini.
Analyst composed the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor was sent to tests on Saturday in repeating a man's judgment accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompense the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, in the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received data from the location of several mobile phones that proved that Tellis was met with Chambers at night of his death contradicting his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When these data showed that his cell phone was met with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the street on Saturday and testified that that day was not found in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers since about two weeks when he died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had been known for only a week ago.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"It's a burden of his life," said Hale.
It is planned that the defense begins its final claims on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the judgment to be seen by the jury on that same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has filled up its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol group, claims that the hip hop has gone away from its origins with political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get back to the fighting hip hop to become popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a rejoicing in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York-based child career asks a couple after a "racist" message
A New York child caregiver will appeal to a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that would not be directed to her from her mother in which she complained that she was "other black."
The couple refuses to be racist and compares demand with a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she discovered that the child career Giselle Maurice was black when she presented her first working day in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After seeing her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs Maurice, affirming that the career who had just left, who was Afro-American, had done her work wrong and expected a philippine according to the New York Post announcement.
Maurice paid her work day and sent her home to a Uber.
Now Maurice will claim the couple to get a freelancer compensation and requires a $ 350 per day compensation for six months of internal work for those who were initially hired, even if there is no media contract.
"Look, I want to show you that these things are not done," he told the Post on Friday, to add later "It's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism affirming that dismissal Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid not to be able to trust her after her offense.
"My wife will send you a message I didn't want to send you.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” his husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offend, although it was due to a mistake?
Your baby just was born?
Come on!"
After comparing the demand with a "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just been pregnant for two months and was found in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going for such a person?
That’s not very ethical,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denied the pair on social media, attacking them by their behaviour and applied logic.
Paddington’s editors feared that readers would not identify themselves with a second-speaking bear if it could be completed in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after his acceptance of the book, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to put on the skin of a person that’s the first time before it’s published.
It’s fun to know what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After saying that her father, who worked as a camera for the BBC before inspiring her to write the child's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of rejecting her work, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agriotic" after her death last year.
From Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family", he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally succeeded.
"He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous," he said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a son who got something: you’re proud even though you didn’t really do it.
I think it felt Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was a creation of its own and product of its imagination, it always gave it all the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to let me go through the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was promptly led to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that he was very bad, that he wasn’t expected to survive.
"Then I received Nad's call to tell me she'd die in the next two minutes and I had to dismiss her.
It's fine.
They said, "Tashi, what a lot of you, my dear.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to you so that your heart continued to latex was consuming slowly and abandoning your body.
She died a long time ago and now she was running away.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t drink or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at the time of struggle for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers, without notice of the calvarium he was suffering.
"No one detected it," he said.
“I had my head down and I was hungry at all times.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this impressive feeling of solidarity with Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Posts of distressed women to avoid suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys take cards on a gallery bridge with inspiration messages and phone numbers to whom you can call to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any father to feel like I have to feel me every day,” he said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that their smile would shine every room.”
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was what he found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: “I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people to whom you can come and with whom you can talk, although you are a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"It didn't remind me that I was sad or depressed or anything like that," he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their attitude.
The Christmas day touched the bottom (when the kids opened their gifts, they made no visual contact with them or nothing).
He claimed that his death had suffered a huge trauma for them, but they must overcome it: “He took away the family.
Challenges.
But we have to go forward and fight.”
If you are costing to go forward, you can call the Samaritans for free via number 116 123 (in the UK and Ireland) to send an e-mail at jo@samaritans.org or visit the Samaritans website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future starts a thread while the FBI starts an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something like what we were asking for (a limited time and limited area investigation), we might be able to achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, suggesting that he feared that the committee was "delete" due to the paralysis of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican sympathizers want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their resilience is due to a matter of deadlines.
If, as expected, Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to obtain the man they wish to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush was calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI completes your report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of desertors in North Korea is lower under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean desertors destined to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong Un's access to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, claimed that 1,127 desertions will be produced last year, far from 2,706 from 2011.
Mr. Park said that the hardening of the border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people responsible for crossing people to the other side of the border were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
To the vast majority of Northern desertors finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The majority of them are across China, which has the largest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the strongly demilitarized zone that exists between the two Koreas.
China considers desertors as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them mandatoryly.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continues in war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
The same month, the leaders of the two countries gathered in Pyongyang to keep talks focused on the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This occurred after the historic June meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, which agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for lack of advances since then.
"If we do not have confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarma ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Ri said in a speech in front of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims it is unsuitable to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and assured that it was not appropriate for its nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"They couldn't avoid thinking that if a woman behaves in such a way, she would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh proved very excited, occasionally almost screaming and remaining speaking while describing his family and his school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee’s Democrats, cataloging the charges against him as a “grote and coordinated reputation murder” organized by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statement demonstrated that he was unable to access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had damages against Democrats.
"I think it disqualifies itself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was targeted when he was asked if he would try to appeal to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the position and if Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“What I have to say is the following: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently present,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeal Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was worried about the possible resolutions she could adopt against Kavanaugh's patient protection law and accessible health care or the Roe case against Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In the view of confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions on whether certain decisions of the Supreme Court would be cancelled.
"It's not time for a hysterical and harmful person to access the court and still on board waiting for us to say, look what good," Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diarrhoea, months, and years of anger exaggerating, and can't expel it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so weird, right?"
He continued: "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique in which, when she was angry and began to cry, she said to the person she was saying, "The best you're thinking I'm crying because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then, it continued.
It sounds brilliant.”
Baghs are allowed as an escape valve for anger partially because they are essentially not understood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first work in a men-dominated office, where I started crying with an impossible anger to describe, was that a larger woman caught me behind the neck, a distant upper woman that always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the corner of the stairs.
"Never let me see you crying," he said.
“You don’t know you’re angry.
They believe that you are sad and that they will comfort you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressman of Colorado at that time, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was collided with an adventure outside of the marriage on a ship named Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the presidential career, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider the idea of presenting her to the presidency.
"It wasn't a well-reflected decision," he commented between laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the career, and the last one they needed was another.
Someone called "Brancaneves and the Seven Ananas".
Because the campaign was advanced, it took a delay in recalling funds, so he swore he wouldn't enter the presidency's career unless he could collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of the supporters of her contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250 to her.
"What do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed by the emotions (from gratitude to the people who supported it, frustrated with the system that made it difficult to collect money and address to voters instead of delegates and angry with existing sexism) which remained without words.
"You would think she was suffering from a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how she reacted to the press with her.
“You thought Kleenex was my sponsorship company.
I think, what are you going to write on my bed?
"Chorou?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China to Beijing be positive?
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were bitter and although the war is far from ending, a distance between the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was produced this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200,000 billion, accounting for half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has ever contra-attacked, the most recent rising rates from five to ten percent to $60,000 billion on American products.
China has promised to imitate US measures, and it seems unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will change in the short term.
In order to get Washington back, it would be necessary to cede to his claims, but to double publicly before the United States would be much more shameful to Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing knows to play their cards correctly, pressures from trade war with the United States could favor China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to start a economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, Asian researcher at Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is "listed" for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the conditions necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to abandon because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their sustainability are already given.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would thank the help he could receive to rebuild a devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or from countries that support the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris

“I don’t cry often, but I can’t avoid it today.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to be able to help,” an excited García said after the European victory.
He passed witness to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods golf by 2&1 in the individual Sunday game.
“It’s incredible that I feel proud to be able to defeat Tiger Woods today. I grew up seeing that boy playing,” 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 major winning, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend to avoid leaving the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk declared after his team’s frustrating performance: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, for a while, the Europeans were in trouble.
We're fighting.
Take off the shoe in front of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup Committee and we will go on.
I want these 12 boys and I'm proud to be a captain.
It's to get the hat out.
They were superior.”
