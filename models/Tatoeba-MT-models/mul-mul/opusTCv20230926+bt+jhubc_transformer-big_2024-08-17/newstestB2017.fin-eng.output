A 28-year-old cook was found dead in San Francisco Shopping Center
Only a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping mall this week.
The brother of the victim says that he didn't know anyone who wanted to harm his brother. "He finally got his case in order.
The body found in the Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia, according to the San Francisco Legal Medical Agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is investigated as a intellectual.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that formerly a coach in Boston, Frank had found his dream work when he rescued the San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant's kitchen menu six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughters Restaurant said death had been shocked to all of them.
"We are a small and tight team like a family. We miss big," the representative said.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank's first place in hostels, but he had finally got his case in order.
"She found an apartment, and she had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and great.
His way to be together with the family was to prepare food for all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked along the river.
Despite all the injustice that occurred in the world, he was a foolish diamond that shine every day,” he said.
Anyone who knows about the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Office 415-575-4444.
Delayed junior doctors demand new workfighting
Representatives of British junior doctors (which are mostly specialized doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and have requested authorisation for new workfighting activities in the dispute on a new employment contract.
The Committee on Junior Medicine (JDC) of the British Medical Representative Association (BMA) is asking for support from the entire government from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students fought the agreement with BMA in a vote held in July.
58 % of the voted members defeated the agreement.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, published on Twitter Thursday night a letter sent to JDC members, in which he said the government's "self-wise" issues that McCourt said led to the fight against the deal.
In this context, the JDC government has fully fought a new contract proposal and requires that all of our concerns take place in new official negotiations.
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC government has today filed an official request to the BMA government, requesting authorisation for small-enlarged workfighting operations since the beginning of September."
As a result of the controversy, junior doctors have been in residence six times this year, including the first complete workplaces ever seen in the history of the UK’s public health system.
Johann Malawana, head of BMA’s junior doctors, resigned after the vote, as he did not approve the negotiated contract terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told the members of the BMA at the previous meetings that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students participating in the vote.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and applies to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: external alliance?
It was a life that decided on the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to negotiate and formally conclude the eight-month word war and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin was taken against his Turkish official in a golden palace in Peter’s palace, I felt a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties said,
But Putin’s smile seemed to be heavy, and he just didn’t get out of the heat even with his own detained measurement.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly talked about Mr. Putin’s “good friend” – according to a report five times.
I didn't stand in bills myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would be restored even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan’s behaviour as if no evil had ever happened.
I thought about her enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the ongoing viley of Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey fired a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow at the time of the event was angry.
Putin attacked Ankara and accused him of trembling his back.
It was even bigger because it came from an unexpected friend.
To get real confidence will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media has visited a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most stable were the charges of top officials that Erdogan’s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in regions governed by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has severely denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting was organized only in order for Putin to apologize to President Erdogan.
This way, Russia might have gained some sort of victory.
The benefits of proclaiming a sequel to Ankara are clear.
First of all, Erdogan will need all possible friends after he was almost excluded from the power in a failed conquest in the last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey are also clear to him.
The agreement also has an economic impact.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey’s hard, especially the charter flight ban, as many millions of Russian tourists travel to the coast of Turkey every year.
The amount has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, travellers and charter companies will certainly be disturbed by the ease of the flight to continue.
They will put their faith in the late season to the Mediterranean.
And yet this week, state television has predicted a decline in the price of fruit and vegetables when imports of Turkey’s agricultural products are allowed again.
"Turisties there, tomatoes back here," the economic journal Vedemost wrote in the article.
But the visit also had a higher political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the west because it believes that the west reacts intuitively to the ruling company.
Don't forget about Turkey's old-fashioned accession negotiations and Putin's absence in matters. Putin, who is excited to take advantage of cold media and worry about Turkey's ties in the west.
Russia's leader certainly won bonus points from Ankara when he expressed his support for the elected authorities after the defeat.
This was clear for Moscow, who had his own concerns about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey, at their top meeting at the Praha coastline, could transmit a picture that one analyst described as a "outland alliance": two countries experienced being rejected and similarly treated in the West, combined their forces.
Despite the public conciliation, these two still have great disputes.
Most importantly, it is Syria, where Moscow has created itself to describe it as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It tells a lot that after almost three hours of start-up negotiations, each president at the press conference said they had not been discussed on the subject at all.
Turkey’s President refused to answer the question about the disputes of the countries, while Putin emphasized them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could strive to agree in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by NATO by Turkey by shooting down the Russian battlefield, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are still in speech.
Royal Bank of Scotland’s banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the RBS Bank, the bank’s operations outside Scotland are undermined in such a way that it continues to offer only business services, namely back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat to its goals when it broke nearly eight years ago and was forced to be saved.
During that time, brand strategies have used RBS to protect other consumer funding brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered the right to allow more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used to shorten RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted into NatWeste, with the exception of the headquarters and securities listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will get higher weight values, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwania was interviewed during a presentation directed to customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said to the BBC Scotland: “RBS becomes an investment brand and that is why our staff serves because we are now becoming much more a bank of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Our efforts are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands.”
RBS has already announced its cease sponsorship of Six Nations and has raised a profile of various brands in sports sponsorship.
“It’s now the right time to move to a bank that contains different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers,” says the CEO of the Bank.
“Tree years ago it would have been very miserable if we were to say we would be an excellent bank for our customers and have put our brands in place.
But the work we do and the focus on the needs of customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time."
Frankie Dettori rided Predilection to win in Newmarket and won 3,000 wins.
The detector is showering the champagne when he won twice in Newmarket, meaning 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettor secured 3,000 wins in the British championship series in Newmarket on Friday.
On this ride, he managed to ride the Predilection twice on his horse the same night on the road of his own locality, and the predilection is the horse that John Gosden trained.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is a sixth jockey that reaches this ride on a flat road in a funny competition.
He was the same as Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time masterjockey Detector, who previously won in Ghayyari, says: "This is special.
My feelings are in custody because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket because I came here 30 years ago.
The competition is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a totally ordinary Friday night and a 20,000-speaking audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility."
Detector receives hurricanes with Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have achieved their goals in the matches, and they are the masterjockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his recording career over 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it’s not surprising that he’s just reached this swing that rarely has reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical skill is what distinguishes him from others.
He is a fantastic representative for the competition, his enthusiasm and passion have brought supporters to the species for years."
"I told Frank a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have won 6,000 matches, unless he would only compete in the weekends and in big games!
Seriously, Frank's riding race has been winning for nearly 30 years in the UK games, which has been great to follow.
He is a living person, which is good for a British race, but above all he is an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettor winded his achievement in a symbolic way, jumping flying down his horse’s back.
“From flying paint inputs to flying inputs, Frankie Dettori has been a model model for the British competition for two decades.
The journey has been high and low.
He has won a number of big shots, including his famous win in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition, he has survived the flight accident and has been in competition for abuse of drugs.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had initial difficulties to start, but he showed admirable strength of the character, seemed to his suspects and returned to his best.
And he’s not been to stop his career for a little while yet – the Detector has recently said he wants to continue the race until at least 50 years old.”
Putin separated Governor Sergei Ivanovin
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin suddenly resigned from his head of government, Sergei Ivanovin.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin’s trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, is now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin newspaper, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov's role as Chief of the Russian presidential administration", but no grounds were made for the dismissal.
It has been appointed deputy Chief of Ivanov since 2012 by Anton Vaino.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Vaino, born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and previously worked in the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later led the President’s Protocol Department and the Government’s Chancellor, the Russian-language website of the Kremlin says.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: “I am grateful for your confidence.
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your actions as the Head of State, which means making bills and supervising how the instructions you have given are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for divorce and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Are the smiles true?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been a member of Vladimir Putin’s neighborhood for a long time, and as Putin, he also has a KGB history.
He was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, Russia’s television show, Ivanov said that he would withdraw from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, only a few explanations are convinced, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are they a result of some kind of warfare?
Nobody knows it yet.
Russia has addressed an extremely doubtful official claim that a man who is eligible to be a president would suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, saying: “It’s true that in the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give my responsibility for this very complex and to some extent even for four years’ hard work.
I have been president’s head for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov received an official in December 2011.
Before that, he served as Deputy Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
When Putin acted as head of the KGB Replaced Federation Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his deputy chief.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanovsky could become President of Russia after the second season of Putin, because the Constitution would have prevented Putin's election for the third season.
However, the task went to the second of Putin's neighboring circle, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to president only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson has been kidnapped by producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute in Los Angeles last month.
The company ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the series, reported outbreaks in their joint communications.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchneer in the series Gibson had filed an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative disputes.
“I’m sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
The information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios newspaper.
Previously, Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson, has been involved in the series since its first production season since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul on it for the last 12 years,” Gibson said in a newspaper.
“I hope I’ll see it until the end of the series, but it’s no longer possible.
I would like to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans that the series could have ever hoped."
The 12th production period of the series will be launched in the United States on September 28.
Mysterious beaching of fish in Banffla Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects the windfish of these 75 fish, which have fallen on the ground as an image of the circle.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the coast, published the picture material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the appearance of these five-cent fish.
Queensferry's supervisors are now connected to Fifeen
The £1.35 billion project will now be completed by May 2017.
The engineers have connected Queensferry’s cross-country to the north and country, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fife.
It is the first of the four part between the "cancer rays" that are now almost ready to bridge around three pillars.
The bridge of Fifesta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 wine bottles.
The £1.35 billion project will now be completed by May 2017.
Minister for the Economy, Keith Brown, visited the country today and was one of the first to walk on the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's supermovement.
We are all witnessing a really significant progress in the construction of a bridge. Only for the construction of this bridge, more than 30,000 concretes and steel have been used.
Despite the massive amount and weight, building the bridge proportion between the land and the bridge is a fine operation that requires extremely accurate installation tolerances.
The entire bridge is now located nearly 79 percent, and the rest of the bridge is now being built in Rosyth, which means that the bridge is ready to be lifted."
Michael Martin, head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “The completion of the first bridge is always a major urinary rifle in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the dish was installed and attached to the North Tower dish, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. the ground) dish.
This was done by drawing from the northern sides of the land bridge 700 mm southward.
This was a massive and at the same time a highly precise operation.
Massive because the land is 222 meters long and weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes, and it had to be pulled up by approximately 3 per cent of the humidity angle.
And high precision demanding because the tolerances that the team had to observe were very small – only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.”
Moelfre Bay’s rescue agency tells about the miracle of three men
Three men who were caught in stock by Anglesey's fishing boat were rescued like a miracle trade.
The Moelfre RNLI sea rescue station made a warning on Friday at 13.20 local time after its crew detected an accident in Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim safely while their boats continued to walk without a driver.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones on Moelfre's rescue boat.
"When we arrived in the waters, the strong winds were so far from carrying the boat."
The local fishing ship rescued two men, while the third, aged 60, was found to be stabbed by a snake and without rescue trails.
They were all taken to the coastal rescue gate and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, “It’s wondering that these three men in stock of water are still alive and completely fine.
The boat's engine had an emergency alarm, but it had some reason to remove the boat from the man's time when it fell.
They were really lucky on their journey."
Pokémon Go Leader brings health and happiness
It is interesting to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but they prefer to stay inside to watch their garbage.
Pokémon Go makes people rise in sofa and movement.
Initially, the field time took only television watching, and then came video games and the latest smartphones.
It is so important to note that technology and external movements do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to Pokémon Go. Pokémon Go is a game app that has characters from video games created in the 1990s (which later also made a series of drawings, games cards and other accessories).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game came to be available in the early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
Shortly described, players go out to find pokémons tracked by their smartphones using GPS. Once the pokémon is found, it can be "photo" (using a phone screen) or "captured".
Wildys has tempted the video game as a younger generation playing and raised the backbones to the sofa.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "median person" takes a day.
The Washington Post recently told the Apple Watch Cardiogram app, which detected within two days of the game’s launch, that 30 minutes a day’s movements suddenly rose from 45 per cent to 53 per cent, followed by 35,000 users.
The company doesn’t know who users play Pokémon Go game, it only sees raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns in which people are encouraged to rise in sofa and move for at least 30 minutes a day have crashed on the ears because the campaigns have been bored and their advertisers have looked accidentally.
However, the importance of the movement is not limited.
Regularly moving, the likelihood of cancer or depression is lower.
Motion helps in weight loss, reduces blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beautiful Pokémon Go game is that it makes people come out to do something they enjoy.
This achieves three basic health-supporting issues: exercise, riding the air and the sun and joy.
During the jack it is possible to get even new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon involves bad fans.
And yes, someone can walk through the door when he plays.
What about it?
The breakthrough has been done.
Although smartphone apps like Fitbit could have already monitored your activity earlier, they did not give any reason to move, as Pokémon Go does.
The innovation will disappear, and the use will decrease in time.
However, thanks to Pokémon’s success, there are more games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, which increases the exercise of hunting people and improves their condition and health.

Simone Biles hits gold in women's mass performance
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
- No, no, no.
You've got a knife.
Great in everything.
And now also the Olympic player.
The 19-year-old U.S. coach won the championship of the multiplayer on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic lighting.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than the silver-seasoned "Final Five" team with Aly Raisman and the Russian pro-scientist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles will be held at the Rion 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the final of the individual women's competition in the United States.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all ages who won the championship of the multiplication, so he strengthened his reputation for the best of all ages or even for the best of all ages.
Biles crashed into the tears when his total final point came to appear and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement brings the species into completely new dimensions and raises it to the same category of sport with other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been in its species for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championships, 10 of which gold, and has earned them with so ambitious and precise programs that 1984 Olympic publisher Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest fan of all times".
There was still one last competition in Brazil that took place, above all, between Biles and herself and the highest expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a golden rider would be disappointed.
The U.S. Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman sweat after winning gold and silver in the final Thursday of the Rion 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first golden county on Tuesday as a point on the i team, coordinating the country team and now retiring Martha Karoly.
Although Biles argued that he had never thought of anything before being at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permantion program – which includes a series of volts known as his power card – has been adapted to Latin music, which could be heard well on the streets outside the Rion Olympic Area.
It's not a coincidence.
When her grandparents were a little adoptive and coach Aimee Boorman's mother found her, Boorman found the girl in a day-to-day visit to the hall where Boorman trained her.
He hasn't lost any multiplayer competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning pipe is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got into a small wire with two wires, it was like a cloth.
The remainder was a boom and a permanence where Biles is a defending world champion.
He got back to the lead position after getting 15.433 points from the boom, and the crown of the final result was earned by 15.933 points.
Raisman humbled him as he waited for the final points – which was just formality – and the tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white and blue, when the wound he once wrote his book came to an end.
Raisman's performance was a small revanche for the back four years of competition, when he first allocated the third place but then lost the prons to Montenegro with the refinement floor.
This time, the 22-year-old head of the team, which Americans call the team "mom" was clearly above the Blackfina.
He sent flight troops to the public after his permanence program, thus becoming a loss-point winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
With regard to Bilesi, this 19-year-old twitter made and widespread in the past week now has a completely new meaning:
Police tells three music in the car to be killed by a serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder for ten years, and the victims were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, the police reported on Thursday.
According to the officials, on June 12, a car parked in the streets was shot at Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with his hand and then fled with another car, the newspaper said.
The police suspected that the cause of a third murder was not a thief because the attacker did not carry his handbags or $2,900 found in possession of the second adult victim.
The Phoenix police officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether the death is related to four previously attacked attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two injured in nine attacks, mostly in Latin American regions within four months.
“It is common for the events that they have been affected in residential areas in front of their homes,” Howard told CBS’s subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late 1990s, the black BMW late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what made them conclude that attacks are related to each other and that their factor is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injury, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellish's daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that the three were sitting in a car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a newspaper that told me about the shooting on an open-pack car was empty only half an hour before the trip, and the shooter was believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found the rejectors and picked off the car’s seat in the car’s seat and the engine’s seat in the car’s seat.
The mother of a 6-year-old child who is sick of microkephalia: "Asians become better"
Like most of the six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also loves songs, toys and of course her mother.
But unlike most other age relatives, Edmund has a micro-kephaly, or a birth childhood, due to her mother Elizabeth Picciuton’s genetic disorder, which she had not been aware of when she was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first idea was not to survive this.
I can't survive this.
I'm not committed to this.
What isn’t true – of course, you’re committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some of the doctors went so far that they suggested the child to be placed in institutional care.
“My first action was that I didn’t believe that such a practice was no longer,” says Picciuto.
Edmund is walking with the roller layer.
Edmund got up sitting and started counting only at the age of three, and he still wasn't talking.
But he moves slowly to his own backdrop.
He walks as assisted and rides a bike.
She loves to play with her two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents Edmund's invention in a reference country that means "song to me".
“We’ll learn from him from a reference language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean the usual reference language, but it also includes Edmund’s inventive references.
The background of the microkephal may have a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund’s case, or pregnant virus infections, such as cough or zicavirus.
Symptoms and predictions have a great difference.
It is still too early to evaluate how it affects the life of those who are sick of zicavirus.
Picciuto reminds me of the uncertain future.
“I’ve been constantly: how we’re going,
how we are going."
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for prediction for a while, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto is hoping to give advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zicavirus.
"Asses are getting better.
There's a way to arrange things.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Rankings and floods caused measurable rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi states
The governor of Louisiana declared on Friday due to severe emergency races and widespread floods. More rains in the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several Southeast Louisiana and South Mississippi rivers flood over their wheels and spread to the vast area as a result of strong hard races.
Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards says the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, reporter of the Governor’s Office for State Security and Emergency, reports that the Agency has received requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbars.
According to Steele, only the Tangipahoan district has requested tens of thousands of sandpieces.
The warning remains valid until Saturdays in most South Louisiana.
According to the report provided by the weather service, water may be added to the area from 76 to 127 mm.
In South Albania, a flood warning was issued on Friday as the rain continued on the Mobile area.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise recording elevations.
According to forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the rivers may have been flooded under Baton Rougen.
In addition, he says that the floods in the Ascension district form a threat, as the floods slowly empty into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the Mississippi state in Louisiana, Liverpool, was on Friday at 9 p.m. higher than ever before.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in Southeast Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and boyfriend were near the rescued Glosteria on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek river, which is usually over 120 meters away from his house, rose quickly during the night.
The other boy in the neighborhood had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with a continuous sweat," Hansford says.
"It stretched out on my belt."
The wife told Hansford that she had never seen the river rising so high over the 48 years she lived in the countryside.
Hansford says he and his family have all the injuries, and he himself is the only swimmer.
The rescue workers had rescued all three large army styles and brought them to the fire station of Gloster, where they were to protect on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods will spread rapidly to a widespread extent, as the turmoil continues, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells Livingston’s nearby detective about the knowledge that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday.
Krautmann says the soil has been severely crushed on Wednesday after the rain began.
According to the authorities, due to the floods of hard rains and streets, the residents of Tangipaho County were forced to rescue their homes and the school hours were forced to be revoked in five school circles.
The Tangipahoan City Council member told CBS’s subsidiary WWL that it had 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has overcome both of them.
Robby Miller, head of the district, said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been in jail.
The evacuated have been opened protective places in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They can come back home when the water starts to get drunk," he says.
Almost twenty streets in the district of Tangipahoa were forced to be closed because of the flood, and sandstones were offered to the inhabitants to try to prevent water from accessing their homes and their business premises.
"The last time we experienced a big flood in March," said Lacy Landrum, a city government leader.
"This flood seems to be equivalent."
In Mississippi, the rain continued smoothly on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Harrison’s rescue director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, a crash flood was reported from the house undercovered, but on Friday it hadn’t been known until now.
Shopper Value Foods, Keith Townson, says she has been living in the Amite area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen it before, and more rain all the time.”
6-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphian shooting
According to the police, a six-year-old boy in Philadelphia, who is already the second six-year-old, has been shot in the city this week.
The children’s grandparents told the CBS Philadelphia channel that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to his grandparents, the son had a number of shotgun wounds in the nipples, the air, the arm, and the stomach, but he was aware of him when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of proof, his little body was full of treasures," son's grandmother Delores Melendez told television company.
"I can't believe this fact."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and several surgery has been made to him.
The family tells the TV company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting the first class at the local sub-grade.
Brown was one of the four people shot in Germantown.
Two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds were shot.
The second 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, a child was found in a critical front bank near the 29-year-old.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police now investigate whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Police researchers told CBS Philadelphia that there was a baptism between many armed men.
The place was filled with a kind of rejects from a variety of assets.
“It’s clear that it was a battle in the ongoing.
The street was rejected on both sides of the foot.
There have been several armed fighters in the area, and they have actively participated in the shooting,” Philadelphian police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
It also refers to many homes and vehicles in the region.
The arrests have not been made, and the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another six-year-old woman who was killed in the city this week was a girl whose hand was deceived when she played on Tuesday in front of her home in the city of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
With this name, I call the women's team for the Olympics, and there are more than one causes.
First, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as high as it is now.
Secondly, this team's three fans, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have been inspired by many colorful girls.
The team's composition, supplemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best women's army player has been an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were on 1 and 2.
That's great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a warrior, and the whole of America hurried.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances of Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, three-time world champions, and the surprising and master-powering programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American who won gold in the replication of women's individual competition.
His teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
These views are at the top of the species, but they do not look like the televised interviews across the globe.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same traces as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Fiinal Five"), because the next team will have only four players, and this is Marta Karol's last year coach.
The reality, however, is that tender strength is expensive sports and tender strengths are mainly practiced in private tender strengths euro which are maintained by their parents. Parents are payable for training costs, facilities, travels, performance rates, competitive fees, hotel fees (trailers, tender strengths, etc.
The spaces of most spatial power euro are located in residential areas that are capable of supporting operations.
The teaching of the strongholds takes place in these mixtures, and this means a costly and long-term commitment to the strongholds’ families.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached the kind of fans since they started a telephone interview.
We have to organize a more affordable and more accessible training for those innumerable young girls whose enthusiasm has been awakened by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my own power plant 20 years ago.
My organization, located in Harlem, has provided a free or affordable possibility for more than 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin Americans), and some of these have overcome national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown in Detroit so that we can offer high-quality telecommunications for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this magnificent Olympic Games.
Strengthening develops the strength, neckliness and body coordination and teaches hard work, church and determination.
This combination brings life-long sustainable benefits and supports good health and success in school and work.
This team has awakened the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start a telephone conversation, and it's quite great.
Participation in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "power" you have shown when you win the Olympics, and for the motivation of so many young girls in different backgrounds to start their way as a well-being, strong and successful young woman.
Junior physicians fought Jeremy Hunt’s proposal and prepare for new breaks
The Ministers hoped to make a decision on the changes to the wages and working conditions by adopting the renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58 per cent of 37,000 junior doctors who voted, i.e., specialized doctors, opposed the proposal.
Health Minister Hunt said in July that plans to get a deal promptly and said the British public health system (NHS) is "not in the country" and that all additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement, which includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care at unsocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Medicines Committee, said yesterday: "Junior physicians are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, particularly fearing that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only eight weeks when the first doctors are transferred into a new agreement, so now you have to move forward because the time is over.
The BMA has strived to resolve the problem by speaking, but the government has unwillingly treated the negotiations, and sometimes not even reacting in any way.
Despite the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his doors are always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, revoke the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, the junior doctors are ready for new workfighting measures.”
In late April, the previous leak delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times, when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to assist delaying doctors in the leak guard.
The Ministers hoped that the amendment would be concluded by concluding a renewed agreement with the officials of the union representing the British physicians.
The BMA wants a better weekend wage for 55,000 junior doctors that the deal will be affected.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS’s employees, appealed to junior doctors that they wouldn’t be rebuilt.
Mortimer says: “The workforce is very little or nothing, but they create pressure for teams and services already at the extrémity and cause anxiety, anxiety and disturbances for patients, caregivers and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Junior Medicine, and in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other parties, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of the supervisor and the disclosure of the disadvantages.
The employees were hoping that a continuous positive commitment to other important topics – such as development, flexibility of training, further training from careers, education costs, mutual recognition of the teaching programme, learning free, and gender-will-containing salary in the field of care – were the signs of education, the seriousness of the work in the field of education, education and the seriousness of work in England.
A drug paid at €2.40 per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are getting around €2.40 a day when the authorities recommend that it be given to more people and for longer use.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is currently administered 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) has indicated that tikagreloria should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even more.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the UK’s Public Health System (NHS) has indicated that tikagreloria should be given to patients for four years in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems even more.
In England, approximately 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, one-quarter of which recurs or suffers from a heart attack.
As a result of heart attacks and stroke, it is a fat that accumulates into the walls of the blood vessels that generates plaques.
If the plaque crashes, it can generate a blood flow, which prevents the blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood vessel drops off, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new stage is higher in people with a heart attack.
Tikagrelori produced by British AstraZenecan, sold by Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of floods.
In today's NICE guideline, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams, and in addition, aspirin is given twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for Terapies for the Implementation of Methods (NICE) said: “Although there are effective treatments that effectively prevent the development of the disease and the emergence of symptoms, up to a quarter of those receiving a heart attack gets a new stage or stroke – often the most fateful consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on the quality of human life.
We have obtained evidence that tikagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and stroke in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendation for temporary use of tikagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of tikagrelor, particularly in terms of bleeding risk, is limited if it is used for more than three years, the use of the treatment method is not recommended for longer periods.
Voting in Muslim regions rose due to political correction
Tower Hamlet’s former mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which resulted in the government’s report.
The political correction-election atmosphere led to the closure of eyes from a widespread election in Muslim communities, reveals the government’s report published today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles strictly criticized police, voters, and city officials that they have turned their eyes away from the vows because of oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.
According to Pickles, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have been allowed to create guard chains outside the votes to protect feared voters.
He suggests voters to submit their identity certificate in order to prove their identity when it comes to voting.
At the moment, the voter must only tell his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to baptize fingers after the unleavened black vote, so that no one can vote twice.
The reporters should be more protected, says Sir Eric.
It requires that reporters be improved access to the documents of the State Council and the decisions of informal boards and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to combat frauds against corruption and economic interests and to combat cultures that prefer them in the wider local governments," he said.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report in East London after the Hamlet vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court ordered that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed due to corruption and numerous illegal procedures.
The Court found that Rahman “involuntaryly distorted” the religious sense of his Muslim community and confessed his wife by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was told that "the foundation of his campaign was that it was the religious duty of every believer Muslim to vote on him."
Up to 300 votes were questionable or sincerely given so that the person voted to some other person.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud from all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about the post-election, where members of the high position of the Muslim community were told that people stressed to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made several proposals for the cleansing of the voting system, including requesting an identity certificate at the vote.
The report says: "There is evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the desire of parents, particularly in the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities."
"I was worried that... state institutions had turned their eyes away from such action because of the "politically correct" ethnicity and oversensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean the system, including the ban on the processing of post voting flags from political activists, in order to prevent the "voice collection".
Theresa May's report currently requires stricter checks in the registration connection to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preference frauds.
Consideration of alternatives that require voters to submit an identity certificate before voting.
Toggle baptizing in the unleavened black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic inspections to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit on requests for automatic post vote.
The ban on the processing of posted voices and posted voices from political activists.
The right of police to form guard chains around the votes.
Amendment of the law in order to make it easier to raise fears under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the enlargement of voting rights.
Denial of photography at the votes.
Allowing only English at the votes (except for Wales).
Strengthening training in order to ensure the supervisory rule of personnel that only one person should go to the voting group at a time.
Sir Eric severely appreciates London police and considers it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no crimes were raised.
"The Election Court separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from his role because of corruption and numerous illegal procedures," he said.
"They were found guilty without suspicion, and the criminal exhibit was overwhelmed on a number of grounds."
He also criticized the inefficient "rescue inspections" of the departments responsible for the city's election lists.
"The decision of the Court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was awakening," said Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of her inheritance as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by a worrying and concealed election will and its prohibition by some parties."
The uniformity of the Olympic biker with Duke Catherine and other twin islands wild at the Rion Olympics
The fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were wild this week from the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose equality with the Duke of Cambridge is amazing.
But, according to social media talks, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not the only athlete fighting for the championship with an equality with a well-known person.
For the honor of all the famous faces of Rio, FEMAIL made a list of all the Olympic players whose uniformity with Hollywood audiences is obvious.
Hunter and chicken: Brady Ellisonia, the U.S.-man's band, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood.
In addition to Catherine’s duchess on bicycle rails, many people have noted on social media how one flexion shooter could be the favourite actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s double brother.
Brady Ellison, the U.S. men's team, caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures published on her, in which she reassuringly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media experience and admitted that since he was a child, he reminded DiCapriota.
“I don’t see the equation as much as I can see, except for bars and trees,” Brady Huffington told Post.
"He's a good guy, so I'm taking this kind of career."
In London’s 2012 games, the British long-term captain Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris highlighted the equation, which will certainly be shown even more in these games.
The great and brilliant Russian singer, Aliya Mustafina, has been known as the dual-isolation of the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghia has been compared to Matthew Morrisoni, known for the Glee TV series for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is "the athletic version" of the Inception film.
Similarly, the tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been noted the likelihood of both strong corner ears and lips.
Swimming silver metalist Yulia Efimova reminds the actress Annalynne McCordia, not just because of her beautifully brown skin and hair, while the U.S. team Nathan Adrian is "the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
These two iron women, football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (left), resemble each other’s face shape and eyes.
Not the only thing: this Twitter user was happy when others also saw the likelihood.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for the couple’s equality.
One twitter recently expressed his joy when “some others on the internet agree on Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter’s equality.”
The U.S. football star and the Dexter series really remarkably resemble each other’s face shape and eyes.
Many have also observed the same in Kerri Walsh-Jennings’ smiles as well as Laura Linney’s golden amplifier Gabby Douglas and Anna return! by the film Gabrielle Union’s wide smile.
CBC's Olympic Commander apologizes after Chinese swimmers say "dead like pigs"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-year-old women's 4 x 200 metres freelancers in the CBC's direct Olympics on Wednesday.
Canadian general radio company CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "deceased" and "deceased as a pig" during a kid.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was disabled when he began to dismiss his own opinions at the end of the 4 x 200 meters freelancer message for women.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's screening teams to bring color, was heard saying, "This 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he went quickly and died like pig.
Thank you for it."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swims the second part of the message at 1:57.79, and remained 1,61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, which led the Canadians to capture China.
Watchers around Canada quickly respond to the tone of the commentator and language usage.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did CBC's explainer just say that a 14-year-old Chinese farmer died like a pig?"
The idiot didn’t realize he was still in the show.”
In the final of a 4 x 200 meter freelancer message for women, AI Yanhania was described with the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter quickly filled with angry comments byron MacDonald, and many asked for his resignation.
The tweezers did not stop their words when they heard how unpleasant Byron Macdonald was.
The twitter Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You are representing CBC and Canada, and you will make us all sound racist."
Scott Russel, hosted by CBC’s mission, quickly regretted MacDonald’s words: “We apologize for the comments made about swimming.
It was an apologies choice, and we're sorry that this happened."
Finally, CBC had to regret more than 90 times for people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr Scott Russel had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and posted his apologies to more than 90 other twitter comments complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The TV company also promptly filed a public apology.
“We are sincerely sorry for these statements and that they came to the mission.
Yesterday, at the mission we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments were associated with the performance of the swim, not personally.
Nevertheless, they were inadequate and the choice of words had to be regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words.”
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apology on the mission and tried to defend his speeches by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I would like to apologize for my comments I gave last night after the women's message," MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic post.
"I was referring to the swimsuit, not a person.
It is also clear that I didn’t mean anything deceitful in my words, and I’m so sorry.”
Primmark prevents underwear in the middle of trade by a woman who shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to watch when the woman crashed in the middle of Primarkia to match the underwear.
He further worsened the situation by assessing how he looked in the underwear, took them out of the leg and put them back in the shelf.
He continued the tour and finally tried four undercover pairs at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkeston.
The Primark chain store in Folkestonen Bouverie Place, where a woman tested the underwear in front of everyone and put them back to the retreat
The mother of two children at the same time traded, Jenny Davidson, says that after trying the underwear, a woman unknown dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says, "People did not believe in their eyes.
And the woman stood in the midst of the trade, and took the vessels of the rejecting, and broke her own vessels and the vessels of the vessel, and put them on her.
He did not try to do it incomprehensiblely, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone watched when he took his testing boots out of his leg, and obviously didn’t like them because he put them back in the shelter.
He did it again three times before he finally decided he didn’t like them, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t feel ashamed of looking – nor thought of a person who would eventually buy the underwear he had made.”
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kent town, says: "How important it is to think that someone brings to his home underwear that someone else has used and not washed them."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I realized that trade personnel tried to remove those clothes from the sale when a woman left – what is right.
It would be terrible to bring new submarines home and notice that someone else has cut them without being washed afterwards,” Davidson added.
The Prime Minister said: “Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday August 9.
All of these products have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the Mayor of the Krav Maga allied in New York, Rhon Mizrachia, and asked how to survive a stay in close proximity with a thief or an injury.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker according to whether the attacker approaches you before or behind.
If the attacker approaches back, the first one must turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooter, Mizrachi says.
Then take it into the place so that it remains between your tears and your shoulders, and strike the attacker on your face freely around your tears.
Then knock the attacker on the knees, and when he goes out of the pain two-fold, knock him on his face with a gun pillow and turn around by holding the gun towards him.
The technology is similar if the armed attacker approaches, you have to move away from the shooter, get into the gun and turn it so that the attacker can't run.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the breastbark. Turn the gun away from the gun, turn back, and hold the gun targeted to the attacker.
Sounds tough?
Look at the video how Mizrachi does it.
Keep in mind, however, that you get rid of the thief safely by giving off your cash – unless you are the Krav Maga size manager.
Ian Wright, a traveler of the world, will find the most dirty places in Europe
The British world traveller put his ability to resist and to refrain from the hard test by shaking the most dirty and contradictory places in Europe.
Suffolk’s writer and travel guide Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his strength by shaking the euro banknote, the Piccadilly Circ, the train’s waterproof button and the Russian general telephone.
Before wearing, Wright measured the objects in luminometric to see himself and to show the viewers what their language was working.
The experiment was made a documentary film Ian Wright – trace of internal power, and its results were surprised.
The idea of swinging the waterproofing button of the train can be illustrative, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen store.
On its journey at the various European restaurants, Wright discusses with doctors and other medical professionals the strengthening of good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he cried was just the mouth of the evil one.
Ian Wright was first known for his travel program, where he tested his intestinal endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Sliding the rail stations’ handles and the water drilling button has undoubtedly challenged Wright’s resistance.
Wright says: "I've been quite careful about my health since I was a child and have put all kinds of mushrooms, butter, butter, and shit in my mouth."
In the film, he really showed his reputation for taxes.
The border was received only in the pressing public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units from the sample.
As a result of the comparison, it should be stated that the number in the counterfeit hands is usually less than 60.
The border came against the Russian public toilet, where Wright refused to knock when the luminometer measured the result of 4,000 units – the same number is less than 60.
Wright is adventured in the documentary film Ian Wright – Indoor Power tracks, where the number of bacteria is visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document, “This is almost the terrible smell I have smelled in a toilet.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
The place is so beautiful that I really don’t do anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright – in cooperation with Valion.
Valio Wright has received milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D from Valio Gefil, which helps to strengthen the gut bacterial base and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category for food, juice and innovation products, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is interesting to see and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we came to the idea to ask Ian."
The health of the intestine has become a global trend.
“Instead of talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a broader connection and tell our daily environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the body has become a global trend, and the document allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakala added: “Let’s say that I’d have lost my respect for Ian if he’d beat certain items we’re asking for, such as pictures of a Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, it was easier for Ian to swallow some items, while some of them were quite bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty bowls described on the tape."
In the 2015 survey, 84 percent of respondents linked milk acid bacteria, particularly to the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent reported that at least at the same time they used products to which milk acid bacteria were added.
The bride family destroyed the rental house owned by the city in Saltashi, Cornwall
The family left afterwards 50,000 pounds of damage to the city to owned a rental house after they had received a wedding due to the terror of the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Trebilcock, have received a wedding after complaints against several couples in Cornwall Saltashi.
When the couple was most forced to remove the apartment, the representatives of the rental residential company stated that the apartment was shocked in the renovation board.
There were shooting holes in the sheet, the floor cars had been cut off, the rock had been spread to the floors and the walls had been torn with graffiti.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Cornwall Housing’s boss Donna McEvoy says fearing that the apartment may no longer be saved.
He says, "This has been full of sorrows for people living here, no one should be tolerated by such.
There is a lot of weight on the matter, because the real estate will probably be known as not so pleasant as part of Cornwal.
The family is bad, as is its name.”
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and the police said that the family’s fearfulness to exercise included street pottery at the baths, fear of the nearest residents, drug use and transmission, as well as heavy shouts, disputes and curses.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the rental contract, received an order for non-social behaviour in June.
A number of rooms in the house below the dish were found of old waste.
The house had previously been selling drugs, and the floor cars had been dismantled.
According to the neighbors, the family’s battle on the street and the police were forced to regularly call the place.
Cornwall’s apartment agency gave them the first 11 weeks of extra time to voluntarily change the couple’s trials this week.
The relieved neighbours were grateful for the wedding—they said their life was the earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived in their neighbourhood for 20 years, and all that time has been difficult.
“The police have visited here incredibly many times.”
“We didn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we haven't noticed it!
It’s going to be wonderful now that they’re finally caught up.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, director for the compulsory practice of the Cornwall housing agency, says that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
Roskia and old toys had been thrown into a wild house.
Fitzpatrick added: “It’s harmful that the renter has not taken any responsibility for his own and his family’s behaviour, because the wedding is always the last action that the Cornwall housing agency considers.
This case was extremely difficult because behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be shocking to see the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my working group, Devon and Cornwalt police and Community members who participated in the work and were bold to provide us with information.
I hope that this step will improve the well-being of neighbors and make a message that social behaviour is unacceptable.”
Fitzpatrick tells us that the family’s three sons had all lived in the apartment at different times, but they were already in two decades.
A dirty patch found in one bedroom of the house after the bride
The employees now need to clean away the waste surrounding the house.
In 2014, police made an apartment with a wheelchair and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, as well as horizontals and other accessories, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine when he was found guilty of holding a class B hume in order to sell it.
He claimed the money to be his son Lee Skeldon's death in 2013 in a car accident.
After becoming homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been consulted in a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were crushed with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding a wedding for renters who violate the rules of the rental contracts.

Low-flighted, hip-hop army shower plane frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed into a low-cost.
According to the Air Force, it was an airplane that was not threatening security.
The picture appears at a time when tourists escaped when a low-flight shower crashed over the entire beach.
The dramatic pictures show how an army airplane gets nearly to the distance of tourists taking the sun on the sandstone in the North of Portugal Aveiro.
The holidaymakers rise to their feet, worried understandably about the motors of the shower machine, which began to belong before they saw what was going through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos published on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It ran the beach twice really low, and was the moment it looked like it would fall into the ground."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I was sure the machine would fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Aveiron were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at an incredibly low level.
Portugal's air forces reported today that the P-3C Orion aircraft's pilot had a training plane designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the aircraft had to be driven so low.
According to the airplane, they had to put a slightly lower normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged the visibility, but the air forces said it didn’t threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of the continent and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said today that because of the poor visibility of the smoke and smoke, the airplane had to be so low.
The aircraft had a training plane, where the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
Better expected results in the first semester
The South Carolina Social and Health Circle (Eksote) made a better outcome in January - €3.4 million in June.
In the first half of the year, the result was exceeding €4.3 million.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment warranty was carried out in all operations.
This year, the exode will shorten the operations.
Exode covers the excess of the previously born deficit.
The remaining percentage may be used to reduce the rivers and buy measures for patients.
The result of the year is expected to be better than €4.6 million.
The Exoten government will discuss the six-month session on Wednesday.
70 Special Borders in Immola swear
70 of the border and marine guards were swearing on Friday.
The military camp of the Border and Marine Guard School was held in Immola on Friday.
The Tenth Special Border Library Course was organized on the equipment’s sporting facility.
He swore to 70 soldiers.
Special Borders are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and fighting tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were invited to be a Special Border Guard.
They were invited to the selection tests of 250.
Special borders have been trained in Immola since 2007.
At the meeting of the veterans during the reign, five wars were involved in veterans of the border forces.
The medieval age is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the occasion were born in 1918.
Criminal investigation helps in detecting and revealing serious crime - ESS.co.uk
Each of the 11 police stations in Finland has operated in the RTA Criminal Investigation and Analysis Unit since 2014.
The activity of the unit is outwardly invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahd and Hämeenlin are included in the police station.
It's drawn by the Lieutenant Lahtee.
As a captain, the Commissioner is in Lahd.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian enthusiast in Hämeenli.
Everyone works in a civilian office.
The unit has demonstrated its useability and necessity, deputy police chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various investigations to other police.
In the meantime, it has acquired information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the latest working methods
The establishment of analytics units is the reform of the newest working methods of police.
The goal was to prevent crimes, i.e., to leave the police more and more rarely calling pills to the place only when they receive an alert.
The data collected and analyzed by the entity will target everyday police activity where it is most necessary.
With the reform of the Police Administration, a Criminal Prosecution Centre was established, with less than three national units and its own Criminal Prosecution Unit for each police agency.
The PTR centre in the context of the central police in Vantaa is conducting operations nationally.
In PTR units, according to their name, the police, customs and border guards are working.
In turn, RTA units work in areas divided by police agencies, and their task is to provide information to both local police forces and government units.
The questionnaire extends outside its territory
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work year, the RTA unit's task is to know what is happening in the area of the entire police agency.
The questionnaire also extends beyond the boundaries of its own institution, as it also does criminality.
The RTA unit has better atk skills.
The unit seeks to draw attention to new phenomena, productive crimes or crimes that are memorable by registers, alert tasks and observations.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important criminal investigation tools.
Everyone has their own way to act.
Handprint can also be seen at work, whether it is fair or criminal.
Based on the performance of the factor, a particular image is made up of.
Competition can be made either based on a method or on a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
The RTA unit’s employees are not going through the city’s necklaces, but their work is not entirely publicly guaranteed.
The use of criminals is not known as its own or its own, as it could lead to the development of their activities by the professionals, which would thus endeavor to prevent the police's criminal investigations.
Police report on the procedures if it predicts that they will be threatened.
For example, such a case had been renewed from the beginning, the method of labelling the empty apartments used in housing murders.
In it, the factors put the apartment in the outer door of the house, a tap, or a rooftop where they tried whether the residents were really on their trips.
The examination material is public for at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most notable is to sign up for a protocol to the court, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
The next time the robbers get their hands in their hand.
For this purpose, Vice-Police Chief Tero Sepp Seppes from Hämee police officer, Commissioner Tuomo Lepolaa from Police of East Finland, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve from Joensu Police Station and Criminal Officer Arto Tuomelaa from Central Police.
Police collect and analyze information to plan practical operations.
Reduction in labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
With governmental cooperation, information is collected outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A London school girl joined her father killed in Syria
One of the three British musicians, Kadiza Sultana, joined the Father last year, has been killed in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee told the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria Raqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have killed the Russians in a statement to Raqqa, which is the base of Isis in Syria, ITV News said Thursday.
Sultana was a 17-year-old and, according to her family, just planned to escape the war from the country and return to Britain.
“It can only be hoped that this acts as a warning example and a testament to make people understand that this is the real risk of going to a war zone – and that makes people abandon their decision,” says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana joined two other Eastern trainers on a Turkish plane and continued their trip by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had been married to the ISIS player in Syria and remained a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton supports Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Democratic President Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic President Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland's Supreme Court Judge if he is elected president.
The Senate’s Republicans have not agreed to confirm Garland’s appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate's majority chairman Mitch McConnell, the next president will be elected a person who is appointed to fill the place of the Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a telephone negotiation on Thursday that he would predict Clinton's choice of Garland "with great security".
Reid's spokesman later clarified that this was just speculation and that Reid hadn't spoken directly to Clinton, whether it intends to call Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "influence the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the U.S. Arbitration Court in the District District of Columbia.
Reid says Garland's appointment of republicans to be President Donald Trump's "people" and "edictators".
He said Trump wouldn’t be an official.
According to Treats, naked calendars are equally well for women as for men.
The Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemeren and introduces a 1970-century-styled, inspired by Pirelli calendar in 2017.
Instead of the popular secrecy models, they want to find the top models of the next generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told earlier this year that his stubborn newspaper was differing from the old school Playboy magazine, because he said: "Playboy is for men.
I do this for women.”
He seems to think about the calendar as well.
"We have to bring back timeless and classical nakedness where women, everywhere men, can enjoy these women's glorious images and inspire them," says Shaw in a press release on the calendar.
"Women will certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful artwork."
The models to the calendar can send images via the network or participate in open selection modes organized in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl attraction: who buys discs?
Lonely, middle-aged men love vinyl.
Before you can write a comment on your angry opposition marking No All SinglesMedia age Men, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is no boom of a millennium generation behind the arrival of the new vinyl plates spoken much, when the millenniums want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead a medieval nostalgic background.
The age of a person who recently bought a vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, the ages of 18 to 24 are less likely to buyers.
It is also not only the desire of fans to hide discs, but the significance is emotionally based: older buyers of vinyl discs are slightly more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56 % v.53 %) and enjoy loneliness (69 % v.66 %).
But do you think youGov results are true?
If this blog had been a TV news broadcast, the camera would follow me as I walked along the dark Soho Street, on my uncovered grey jacket. I would live sharply, screw my hands into a cup and say something of traditional, like, "Let's get clear."
So let's make it clear.
Although Soho has slowly lost its attractiveness and rigidity, when the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have been overthrown before the spaces owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a lot of special plate shops.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply for the men visiting these stores very closely and try to monitor their age and nature.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by the Sister Ray movement (as customers at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (as customers at the moment eight middle-aged men, one probably twin women) is on a meeting in London during the afternoon and spending an extra time familiar.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I'm sure it's," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 4000 records."
These discs fill up her living room wall, as the picture shows. (Stuart sent me a photo by email, I didn't follow her home.)
The reason why he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is part of his available income. He is now able to buy records that he had no reserves for when they first appeared, and buy things that he had to be young and moneyless to sell.
“There are a lot of things that appeared at the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 70s when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them,” he said.
He agrees that vinyl plates buying are more likely to be introverts that enjoy themselves with them, and more: “I don’t burn, and I don’t even drink.
It's my fault."
The 25-year-old Wez, who works in the Sister Ray Movement, also believes that many of their customers are compatible with the YouGov profile.
However, he has observed a new type of human flow, which has been influenced by the media hype. These people have heard of the arrival of vinyl discs and now feel forced to buy their old discs back.
"On the basis of my time discussions, people had usually left their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back,” he says.
This can explain the bum of certain vinyl turbines.
What about the alleged sensitive significance of the voice records?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, they will realize that they offer a comforting community for similar types.
Wez said that some of the older customers were particularly disturbed by the uncontact payment system.
The digital world may confuse some of the vinyl fans, to whom returning to the well-known plates means sustainability and reminding youth of the days of happiness.
"I think that it sometimes fills some hole or material assets to be acquired as some kind of comfort," Wez says.
“I experienced it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others.
It’s an easy way to get thoughts elsewhere.”
"We're like social workers!" says Wez's colleague behind the disc surface.
An ICM-miliped study in April revealed that nearly 50% of the vinyl album purchased in the previous month had not yet been listening to the album.
The study also suggested that 41 percent have a disk player they never use, and 7 percent of vinyl shoppers do not have a disk player at all.
At this stage of the news broadcast I would probably seem to be serious in the same way as browsing pity bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of vinyl plates is also associated with the "pokal phenomenon" of the Sounds of the Universe movement (as customers at the moment three middle-aged men) sold by Jonny, 42 years old.
"A customer recently came out and said he didn't have a recorder, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so he can put it on his back," Jonny says.
“The share of such customers is not great, but they are.
Materiality is more important for them.
Some of our customers say they don't have a disk.
They are younger, not older, largely teenagers who are just starting to engage.”
The customer is considerably more varied in the Fopp, to which the next page is available. The business has owned a full layer of vinyl plates.
There are seventy-seven pairs, photography tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers rejoices, although the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: to speak up is a synthetic pope instead of a jazz that can be used in Wild Beast’s newest sex.
No customer looks particularly single, but it’s hard to find a trauma from a psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Foppia for a few minutes and has looked at various disks on discount.
He's looking at it rather than making shopping.
He says his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect discs.
"They're paying a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fine wine is...,” she leaves a wonderful sweat and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop called the inspired new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I'll remember a number of teenage girls who would imagine hitting the craftsmen's sorts, but instead gathering around the Polaroid cameras. I see the father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley disc player.
On the left, there is a wall filled with Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac discs: a mix of modern music and classics, the main discs of any medium collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and a part so high that they are not even overwhelmed.
They are pure "art vinyl" decoration.
But given that all means of getting attention to these plates may mean more money to the industry and send some customers to the search trip to Soho, there is hardly any reason to complain.
It is not surprising that a population group with more likely time and money than most people, is also the group that spends most money on luxuries, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research shows that youGov’s results are true, at least in the Soho plates, they do not exclude a large number of female fans and vinyl fans, which are actually available both in the plate stores and on the online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or work life.
They will not at least spend their Thursday mornings in the Berwick Street discs, browsing discs, and avoiding a 30-year-old television drinker, who fearfully watches and admires unexpected middle-aged men.
Holker, the ice cream, is the most live backbone – video report
According to researchers, the world’s most lively spine is a ice cream.
According to Haitian researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice cream was aged 272-512 years, a feminist woman.
The French court rejected the application for the dismantling of trades in the camp
The French court has rejected the Calais authorities' application, which requires the removal of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants by seating thousands of refugees in a five-story camp.
Calais's authorities made claims in the court proceedings held this week that the state should have the permission to distribute 72 temporary trades for refugee camps. The stores sell different goods for refugee camp residents to smoke energy drinks and offer haircuts. The temporary restaurant can buy 50 cents of tea.
According to the Calais prefecture authorities, these stores and restaurants must be removed because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent a grey economy and because they are involved in fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups reported to the Court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals offered by the State’s organization and other parties are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The court concluded that there was no legal basis for the eradication of 72 temporary trade holders, but Calais's prefect's concern was "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s food shops, coffee shops and restaurants are much more important than just offering food to people who “live under extremely unstable conditions”.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the locations below the discharge was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids coffee, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum services for hundreds of minors without care for the camp, whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address where children’s cafes are required to be preserved.
According to a letter sent to the Guardian, its closing would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years of age.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that after the intense increase in summer fires, the population of the five-year camp has increased to more than 9,000 people.
The price of the space in Finland falls clearly faster than on average in the EU
In Finland, food is sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
In Finland, the price of the area has fallen by nearly 5 per cent over three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, food has become one percent the most expensive in Germany and Sweden.
Over the past three years, food prices have fallen in Finland in most EU countries with a level of salary similar to in Finland.
Only in the UK the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The data appears in the article of the Statistical Development Center, Ilkka Magazine, published on the Information & Trends blog.
The simple comparison of real prices, i.e. prices, which are proportionate to the general evolution of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food increased strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price of the EU membership,” Lehtinen said.
Then followed your turn, after which food has become cheaper a year ago.
The prices are now under pressure by Russia’s bans on food imports that have pushed food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and the prices of agricultural producers have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finnish consumers with a short term," Lehtinen says.
The decline in prices in industry and trade has also affected the decline in prices.
The large trade chains of the S group and the Central have both lowered their prices.
Consumer prices have been displayed as displayed advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a type of cheap food, although the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive of the EU countries with a similar level of wage as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food for sale in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He noted that if the comparison countries had the same rate of VAT, they would sell food from similar countries to the cheapest third at the rate of wages in Finland.
It compares Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate had seven in comparable countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell cheaper food than the Finnish.
"If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the food industry, VAT must be halfway to the middle level of the EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen wrote.
The report notes that its calculations on VAT percentages are directed.
The school is no longer an ex
When you go back to school, you may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for the school, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-semesters.
This is a guide to all schools in Finland.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beauty writing is abandoned, and instead, the practice of encoding begins at schools.
Swedish education begins at the age of six, and social learning begins at the age of four.
However, the major change concerns the role of students.
It was thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, schooling is trying to make it more interesting.
The world’s longest backbone found – ice cream can live up to 400 years
The ice cream (Somniosus microcephalus) is only 150 years old.
It can live after 250 years, a new study reports.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone of the modern world.
In an animal, it only passes through an Icelandic bump, whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland floods along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Narratives make dogs grow longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
As the growth rate is slow, according to observations, only about a centimeter a year, adults have lived mostly for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified adult ice creams from 28 women who had remained in fishing fish.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiation of glasses.
The average age of the tested hammers was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish, 493 and 502 centimeters of the stock, were revealed for about 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have found that ice creams reach gender capacity only over four meters, researchers have decreased that they are at that stage about 150 years of age.
Research was published by Science.
Stockmann's withdrawals to nearly 300 - sellers are not reduced
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company with difficulties ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be carried out in terms of resignation," Stockmann said in a statement.
Accordingly, the number of salesmen of goods houses will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 supporting employees are offered new jobs as a seller.
Stockman’s yt-new negotiations concern about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning of the reduction, it was estimated that there were about 380 employees.
With a small reduction, cost savings of around EUR 20 million will be achieved annually for the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an effectiveness programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockman's difficulty in getting profitable from the goods trade.
While the group’s adjusted revenue improves to €11.1 million in the second quarter, the trade of goods is still being lost.
According to Stockman’s CEO Lauri Veija, sales in goods houses have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
“Reductions in employees are unfortunately necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail’s positive business outcome in 2018,” the report said.
In the second quarter of the result savings background, Lindex’s clothing chain had a good success.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results in the best quarter of all time.
Lindex’s profit increased from €9.5 million to €28.1 million.
Last year, the entire Stockmann Group’s revenue was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the group’s turnover is going to collapse since last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be a little positive this year.
Friday is the rainest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The low-weight centre on the north of Finland holds the weather rain on Friday, the HS meteorologist Ilona Láng said.
Also in the middle of the country there are rainbows, but in the south there is pouch.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as the livestock will be less than 20 degrees in the entire country.
In the northern rain regions, it will be 10-15 degrees.
Kenya’s general sports team will support the doping scandal - a strange explanation for the coach’s temptation
Kenya general athlete John Anzrah was sent home from Rion's Olympics after it appeared that Anzrah appeared in the country's team as a doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete who tried to play Anzrah was a 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, Kenya's team leader, said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a Rotichina sample in the surprising test.
Doping officers visited the Anzrah authorities in a statement.
According to Anzrah, Anzrah was sent home because he “have committed a crime against the Kenyan country team.”
He appeared as a athlete, gave a sample of urine and even signed documents.
We can’t accept any use,” the President of the Kenian Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, said in turn, was the news agency for Reuters.
The Olympic general sport begins on Friday, and Rotichin must run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the driver is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was a fourth tournament in the last year and had the winnings of Rion.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan public sports team argued that Anzrah was running on the athlete’s accreditation card only to get free meals in the kisali.
When the antidoping officers met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
“The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of revealing himself,” the source said.
Where are they all?
The Rion Public Sports Stadium will rubbish its vacuum
Where are they all right?
At least at the Rion Olympics, there is no public sport.
In Ria, the competition was started on Friday, but the world’s top players were able to present their skills as a confusing fool.
The Rion organizers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first morning tournament tickets and 65 per cent of the evening tickets were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium broke out of a hurricane crowd.
Final tickets are already sold in Riga.
The Rion Olympic watch has drawn attention before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty banks have been seen in rugby, melody and riding views.
When Brazil’s mital wishes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach ball in the legendary Copacabana, it was estimated that only 70% was full.
After Brazilian people, the Netherlands played against Russia, with about 30 per cent of 12,000 people being full of views.
At least the poor people explain that Brazil is far from European and Asian gambling players, and many of the Olympic Games are strange for Brazilians who are playing football.
Nevertheless, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get the football stadium in full.
Mario Andrada, who was a kidnapper, said the tickets had been sold at the time by 82%, which was clearly lower than four years ago.
“The owner still has 1.1 million remains to be sold,” he said.
The 8.5 million London Olympic tickets were sold 8.2 million, although the tickets cost almost half more than Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for openers.
More than half of the tickets will cost less than €16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Ria because the organizers need money and try to get tickets to sell until the last moment.
In Riga, organizers have actually given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for less known species, such as golf and rugby.
At Rion stadium in the morning, there were enough empty places.
Even the Copacaba beach ball has not been interested in the public.
Jukka Central Championship competed in London in 2012.
A lot of papers are enough.
New Way to Protect Nature - Acquire Right to Earth
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the latest nature protection.
The foundation founded last year acquired ecologically significant natural areas.
After that, private, corporations and entities can repay ownership rights in the land area with money.
The foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapis.
The area is virtually divided into blocks that you want to acquire for a payment of ownership.
The holder receives a veto right to the size of 187 square blocks, meaning in practice that each holder is not required to be approved if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
The ownership rights can also be purchased for more blocks.
Acquiring a governance law is something concrete that may leave your legacy or give it a gift.
You don’t have to leave to wear banderoles or complain about yourself somewhere to protect nature,” said Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the company of the management law.
You will receive exact location information from your block, which allows you to visit, for example, the block.
On the Foundation website, the names of the ownership rights acquired are amazing on the same map where the block details of the area are found.
A widespread weight sees its natural conservation procurement as a risk only that the foundation’s activity changes from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a public-interest foundation aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and the nature.
The risk is that the foundation acts somehow irrelevant or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Holder project is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land areas either by buying or as a gift.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protective countries.
It also aims to move outside the borders of Finland and plans to import countries from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki merchant on August 13-19.
Bicycle robbers are tormented by the worst of major cities in Turku - see the situation of your hometown
Bicycle robbers are tormented by Finland’s biggest cities in Turku.
This year there is more bicycles stolen than in nine of the largest cities.
Based on wheel ruptures reported to the police, the number of bicycles stolen in January-September of this year and their parts per thousand inhabitants were calculated in the ten largest cities.
In addition to the tour, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti were raised.
According to the police, four to five wheel stealing per thousand inhabitants occurred.
In Espoo and Kouvol, only about two thousand wheel stealing per population were reported to the police.
That's a big difference.
"In other cities, the number of thefts is doubled in proportion to the population compared to other cities," police officer Tommi Reen said.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels are stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have the answer to that.
“The generality of lights can affect how much in the city is moved by wheels and how much wheels are above,” said Temu Mother.
The police government Tommi Reen is very expected to rise in comparison with Turku, Helsinki and Oulu.
The number of wheelchairs goes largely depending on what are school and cycling cities.
The market has a narrow center, short distances and a lot of wheels to offer for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a completely different city where the city centers are far from each other and the bike is not necessarily a primary mobility tool,” Reen says.
In January-September, all of Finland's police information has been reported to have a little less wheel loss than last year.
Great joy is still not a subject.
Despite the decline in recent years, more than 20,000 wheel stealing is reported by the police every year.
It means 50-60 filars every day and only about 4,000 wheels a year in Helsinki.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take more wheels, because only some of the victims report the stealing to the police.
Reen calls for people to make a criminal report on wheel stealing, even less than every ten police officers reported.
The typical detected wheel stealing is the one where the police gets information about the stealing immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The incidents will also occur in other investigations when, for example, the stealing wheels in the apartment can be found,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, wheelchairs are arrested each week by the work itself or in the case of a police investigation, says senior counterpart Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, inner wheelchairs, warehouses, and wheelchairs from virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Individual wheel models are stolen most like the Jopoes in the past years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some stealing takes a wheel, for example, for their own use, but most of the stolen wheels end up selling, for example, via the internet.
They will stay in their own market.
“At least the police haven’t learned that the stolen wheels would hardly go abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of stolen wheels, according to the police, are ordinary Finnish.
Some of you must buy a stolen bike unknown.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may be guilty of crash or infringement.
“The clock should be called if the wheels are sold at a clear lower price,” Reen says.
Special library officer Severi Hirvi is always carrying the color of his Nops during his working day to protect the Kallion library in Helsinki.
He had five pieces of wheels, but none of them was stolen, the monster says, "There's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this doesn't so attract thieves, there's probably no hipster value here," the Hellenic monster thinks.
In the chaos in Helsinki Kalli, the Siiri Valve quickly closed its bike with a small u-look.
Now the wheel knocked the kiosk against the wall, but typically Valve locks its wheel into some fixed, such as a wheelchair.
"It's going to be a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," the Helsinky student says about his white bike, whose wallet alone paid about five hundred euros.
All the time friends hear that the wheels have been spent.
"Even for bad wheels, such a ruin-Jopes."
The wheel was stolen from the interior of the home company a year ago.
The wheel was unlocked, so Valve was able to wait for it to be done.
People under the age of 15 are responsible for crimes?
Helsinki is experiencing US-famous compartment teams
In Helsinki, the so-called verbal lighting team is tested to prevent young people from entering the crime centre.
Initially, the trial applies to those under the age of 15 who are now without criminal liability.
The Comparison Team is missing the first youth to commit a crime.
The idea is that the Comparative Commission discusses the incident with the criminal and imposes a penalty.
A week later, the offender can join the Prosecutor in order to compensate for his deeds.
Other consequences can be, for example, a letter written to the family that explains what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio tells us that the model is not strict.
We also have other matching models that are used simultaneously.
"Everything is guided by the young man's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything will not go astray from the first mistake," Laitio says.
The Comparison Office has taken a model from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that the young man, after his first crime, is not ahead of the adult panel, but reflected what happened in his direction with the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The experienced service design agency, Palmu’s service designer Iikka Lovio, says that it was an accident that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes for younger than 15 years have not been treated before.
“It’s been a message that keep on choosing the road,” Lovio says.
The Comparative Team is part of the Helsinki Project for immigrants youth, which is based on the city of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to everyone in need, not only to immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop funding Trump’s campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling for the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was published by the U.S. newspaper Politico, who had received it to see the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is directed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
Signatures want the party’s money to be transferred to Congress elections instead of Trump’s campaign.
"We believe that the disputes caused by Donald Trump, as well as his incompatibility, inability, and recording disobedience threaten to bring a vote round to the Democrats in these elections," Police said in a statement.
Only the directing of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from falling into Trump’s neck.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, as Trump’s chances of winning presidential elections will decrease day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent in the next week.
Among the signatures include politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman, and Vin Weber.
One of the organizational individuals of the letter is apparently Trump’s opponent Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein said that the letter came from "people who want to protect the party's majority at Congress" and that there is no support for anyone.
The letter lists several acts of Donald Trump, believed to have lost millions of voters.
In addition, it is said to have demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump.
Clinton promises to facilitate U.S. children’s families
In the United States, Democratic President Hillary Clinton told the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I strive to be President to make the U.S. economy good for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a statement.
Clinton’s plan is in the middle of a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases of rich people, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-building for American dune routes suffering from the transfer of factories to cheap labour countries.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good wages after World War II.
We are a builder, we need to come back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, pointing out that rich people should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the U.S. as a taxpayer, it must pay the departure tax, Clinton said.
Today, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement that he has previously supported.
"As the President, I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to the Washington Post speculations published before Clinton’s speech, Clinton was intending to criticize the economic programme announced by the Republicans by Donald Trump on Monday that it “is only taking such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal to cut down on corporate taxes Clinton has previously called Trump’s “pornstar”.
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded the listeners of small businesses whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America big again, he should start making himself products in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rion viewing numbers: Kittens haven't joined Finnish to the edge of the windows, but the mobile app is interested in
Usually, sports halls are viewed in television spectator statistics as hard mountain tops.
The Rion Olympics haven’t achieved a huge number of viewers so far.
At the same time, 12 percent of the population have been closer to the squares: the swim was followed by 615,000 viewers from the Olympic Channel TV2 on Tuesday.
For comparison, the one-month rear EM championships received nearly 800 000 viewers at the end of TV2, and the second million EM championships were real.
So far, the Olympic Games have been most interested in the cycling on Sunday and the five-day streaming, which both reached nearly half a million viewers at the same time.
Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the numbers of viewers and reminds the viewers of Rion Olympics for the first time in several different ways.
In addition to TV, the Finnish follows the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
The TV viewers are also distributed on TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rion Olympics are the first sports players to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500,000 all the time, it is a good base.
The number of viewers is less than in the 2012 London Games or in the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is to explain the time difference in contributing - a large portion of Rio's posts come from the nighttime in Finland.
Another reason for his interest - if somebody now considers it to be - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise figure from the beginning, the interest would have been pumped up with it.
In addition, public sports are only at the beginning, as well as other Finnish species of interest: boat riding and riding.
Initially, the numbers of viewers were nearly expected, according to Pokkis.
When the public sport begins, the views are exploding.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first days of the games, became the most downloaded app in the Apple App Store in Finland for free.
By Monday, the application was uploaded 150,000 times.
I would like to say that we're going on the 200,000 loading paths.
"We'll only get the views of the network later."
Rio Areena hasn't worked for all users hopefully.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the mistakes have been corrected.
The use of Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other small technical problems at the initial stage.
Apps have received updated versions to fix errors.
Rion Olympics are seen on the Channels and Arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and Yle Speech transmits chickens every day on radio.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working animals for Y'l ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Y'l channels.
From 2018 to 2018, the Olympic sports will be displayed on both over and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to the official report, Finland’s deepest lake is your day, with a depth of 95.3 meters on the Cross.
It might be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical scholar, found a pressure of about 20 square meters on the cross, with a depth of 104 meters on the ground.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environmental Centre tried to confirm the observation with a mini-consumer.
The method may not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, development engineer Jari Hakala says.
So far, the official depth is 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvas Water (90 meters).
More than 80 meters from Saimaa, Reiswater and Head Lake.
They have not been investigated as accurately as the Day.
In particular, the bottom of the Inar Lake is not accurately mapped.
“There could be some unknown depths,” Kannela said.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Juka lake, 23 meters.
In this regard, your Day will not reach the deepest ten, and the Suvas Water will be even longer than the top.
Repair of 12 August at 14:29: Repair of the last paragraph where the deepest lakes in their medium depths were wrong.
Immigrant taxes: Retirement taxes are still more
Retirement taxes are still more stable than salaries.
Ihalainen says that the inconvenience occurred under representative elections and the pension tax was promised to equate salaries.
The government’s presentation does not include such a thing.
We believe that it should definitely be.
The promises should be fulfilled after the elections, he says to the Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wagemakers had reduced jobs that would reduce taxes.
The case was warmed by representatives of the opposition at the House of Representatives, who denounced those of the Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbi's election permissions.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihail, in the line of taxation presented by Minister of State for Finance Petteri Orpon, it is mainly about safeguarding and not increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on buying power and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipil (center) and Orpo to respect the competitiveness agreement.
He says that keeping the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the main economic and employment policy of the government.
It has been done by the power of the labour market organizations, so it should not be questioned.
This is necessary because the economy is so much in the stocks of domestic demand and people's own future.
Long-term unemployment
The idea is to appeal to the government that it would be affected by long-term unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
Long-term unemployment was approximately 17,000 more in June than a year before.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's goal will escape from the rise of employment to 72 per cent.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is left behind, there is a very large social decline in the authorisation.
Ambassador: In Thai attacks, Finnish sugars are not known
At least four people died in the bombs that occurred in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finnish to be careful in the country and to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish Christians who are traveling to Thailand have no reason to withdraw their trip due to explosions, but the Embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale says.
Very few Finnish in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai travel season is a year-round tour.
Most Thai travelers come from Southern Europe and China from this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finnish residents in Thailand on Facebook after the bomb attacks.
The Embassy has tried to target particularly Finnish people in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact personnel in Hua Hin are currently away from the city.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information about the factor
Westphalen says there is no information about the attack factor yet.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be associated with the political discouragement of the Thai society and the last week's referendum on the drafting of a military constitution.
The law was adopted in the referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
People were arrested, among other things, who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, there is an ethnic and national conflict involving the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their self-determination rights.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been spread to tourist attractions.
Today, Bangkok is a great local celebration, Westphale says.
According to him, in the city they celebrate the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the day’s journey so that the authorities are very accurate about security.
Thai police: Attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say attacks are a "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, the Thai police news agency said.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have been explosived across the country, such as tourists’ favorites in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland’s favorite tourist destination, the holiday home in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, says the Thai magazine Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require deaths.
Two bombs exploded at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin has, according to local authorities, explosed a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombs.
In addition, in South Thailand, Surat Than's village and in Trang's city, at least one bomb was exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, leader of the Thai military mission, the attacker has not yet been known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
“We don’t want people to panic anymore,” he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang attacks are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all of the attacks have occurred in tourist attractions.
The Finnish Embassy calls on the attention of Finnish residents in the country to avoid the most busy tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish traveling to Thailand is not a reason to withdraw their trip due to explosions, but it is worth paying attention to the instructions of high-speed caution, Westphale says.
Injured Europeans
The attacks and their victims occurred during the night of Finland are very little known to date.
Last year's attack in Hua Hin was expected to get a little bit more information.
A local woman died and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last strike in Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the famous watch tower.
Thai PBS says the police have isolated the area in Hua Hin from which it believes they have found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the governor of the province.
The municipality’s employee died in the attack.
There are at least one injured.
CNN's interviewed police chief says the attack of Surat Than also has been used by two bombs that explode every half an hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs were explosive in front of two different police stations.
U.S. Biles won the Women's Fourth
Alexandra Raisman was a second score of 60,098 and Russia's third score of 58,665 points, Alija Mustafina.
Biles, 18, is still targeting the championships in the games of Rion with permanence, hype and trees.
Biles has managed the violence of women over the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from three of the previous seasons.
He won the championships of four games and permanon three times in a consecutive manner as well as the boom last and the second year.
In the U.S. team in Biles, two teams have won the world championship.
The bigger MMs in Biles have jumps and trees.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "Isle has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombing attacks on tourism with the real estate agency and children's playground in the same property in Phuket.
If there are no more strikes, I don’t think there will be any more miracles in this regard, considering Huovila as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
Experienced entrepreneurs have seen nearly many tragedy experienced in Thailand.
There's always something here.
The first was a tsunami, then a bird influenza, and last year a bomb shot in Bangkok.
If these people haven’t escaped tourists, that’s not the case.
The company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
He heard of the attack from his own employee.
The employee called about nine local hours and said he wouldn't have to come to the office.
Note that both the beach street and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the disputes were placed for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to a Friday celebration in Thailand.
At Patong, the mood was calm and the main street movements allowed to open about 10 o'clock local time.
Many people haven’t even heard of the attacks on the beach.
About half of the day in Thailand's time Patong traffic had normalised and a large number of stores had opened their doors.
Based on the spot, the explosion has been quite small, and on the spot visiting Huovila says.
Later, the car was seen in the Kruuce at Jouxholmint.
When the police arrived, the car was burned.
The party found a man who had been hiding in a nearby moon.
Another man was arrested immediately.
The other man fled, but he was later found in the forest with a police dog.
Men are suspected of the traffic stealing, stealing and serious damage.
The police thank you for the advice given.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Transmission to Clear Discrimination
In Russia, on Friday, a high-value leadership change took place in the years when President Vladimir Putin separated his government chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's follower is the 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He's a former diplomat and acts as Ivanov's two-person man.
The Kangas Party says that the cause of Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling of lead tasks is one way of using the revolution.
This is a way to prevent people from becoming independent of the president.
According to the Kangas Party, it is also possible that Ivanov has been injured with or defeated with other managers.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belonged to Putin’s internal circle, is moving to the specific tasks of environmental and transport.
Putin said the change in a joint decision by expressing the state media.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for transfer to other tasks and proposed Vaino to be in place, Russia Today said.
The Kangas Party says that from the point of view of Ivanov it is a clear outbreak of position.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in Russia's important order.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played a significant role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered a possible follower of Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
The Kangas Party notes that the old card, such as governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
An older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi from the Foreign Policy Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov’s place is that Putin turns his neighbor to a younger.
ISIS players used civilians as a human race in withdrawal in Syria
They used civilians as human race when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Organization, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were transported to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters received about 90 percent of the important Manbij city for Father.
However, dozens of jihads remained in the city at that time.
Repaired earlier news at 19:30: Earlier, we wrongly told the civilians were fleeing the city, in fact, the ISIS players kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: The documentation of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
The lines of the Ministry of Interior on the publicity of documents are illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law from the University of East Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the documentation cannot be based on the authority’s own lines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of Interior had previously refused to grant a list of participants to the Minister of Interior occasions to the Night of Sanoma.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Council of State and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting office.
The ministry’s Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noticed the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Riga
As in recent years, Bolt has been running under the value matches against time.
From the beginning of the season, he had his back and had to leave the Olympics in Jamaica.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I’m much better.
I've been practicing well and it's key, Bolt said at his press conference in Riga.
This press facility contained small ports and fans that became journalists.
Porina Bolt undermines the fact that the Jamaican star has risen during the periods in which the general sport has fought with doping scandals and swinging interest.
Bolt's previous loss in the 2004 Olympics occurred in Athens, where he collapsed at the start of 200 meters at 21.05.
At that time, Bolt, a 17-year-old, was a young promise that slowed down the injuries and found your workspace.
Four years later, in Beijing, his power began with a hundred meters, breaking the world record and competitors’ self-confidence despite the end of the celebration, at the time of 9.69.
This is harder.
A year later in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt achieved his career by measuring the law point.
World records born in Berlin at 9.58 meters and 19.19 meters are still valid.
In Riosa, Bolt has announced its target of a 200-meter world record and a 19-second submission, but nobody believes its creation except Bolt himself.
The most challenging player of Bolt is Justin Gatlin, the 2004 Olympic player in Athens.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt bloomed the American in just one hundred seconds.
Bolt hasn't lost any time in the final of the matches in Beijing during his reign.
In 2011, Boltilta remained unreleased in the 2011 World Cup final.
Bolt will fill a wealthy week after 30.
He's an old man in young men's species, and Rion's games are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year's championships in London for the last time.
These are the Olympics that distinguish me from others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But whenever I'm underground, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reflections about Riga: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhuan, Chinese journalist Chen Xinyi, 18, has issued a positive doping show at the Rion Olympics.
Chinese doping officer Chen Xinyin found traces of prohibited substances in the doping sample.
Bulgarian drinkers Silvia Danekova are also suspected of doping.
In addition, the Kenyan public sports coach was passed home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
He settled in Riga as a fourth woman in 100 meters of peril.
According to Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese journalist has exported his doping case to the CAS of the International Petition Court for Sports.
Xinhua says that the sample given by Xinyin on Sunday had been found signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretic.
There are also other doping suspects in Riga.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female drinker Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo hormone.
In turn, Kenya has moved Riga to the home of a general sports coach due to a doping crack.
The International Olympic Committee KOK said Thursday that the Kenya coach had become a test athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to media, Kenya’s fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mailin, he had used the Ferguson Rotich, a 800-metre driver.
Phelpsis doesn't stop anything - historical gold came into screen style
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps swims 200 meters between his 22th Olympic tournament in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimming pool of the same species in the four-star Olympics.
The Phelps win time was 1.54.66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino was secondly in a mixture before China’s Wang Shunia.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at an early evening interview.
Helen Skelton (Ok.) is the most read on this week's Dinner website.
Rebecca Adlington's fourth commentary.
Skelton doesn’t have much stress if the soma or the British press has a little bit of his revealing and special residents.
The TV is a visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton has been dressed in high-altitude shoes and short hairdresser with at least enough reflectivity - at least in the eyes of many conservative british cowboys.
The back steps are not permitted.
It’s important to look good, and the small crowds are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to hydrate and maybe be disturbed, but he emphasizes that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We are watching sports here, and we need to be athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the size has exceeded Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do things and how great sacrifices they do, it's okay for me, Skelton.
You know what?
It's an empty thing if it comes to dressing (drinker).
I'm a little interested if such a person is in touch with someone.
Rion police arrested two for terrorist suspicion
Rion police said it had arrested two people due to terrorist suspects.
Police arrested during the security surveillance of the kittens.
At the same time, the police arrested five more and interrogated two people before their release.

The detained were aware of violence on social media.
Messages that threaten violence have been spread amongst other popular WhatsApp services.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the security of Rion's races.
Police exploded a suspected package in Riga
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rion basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball area and closed the place to the public.
The police entered the public after the explosion was controlled.
This was the third time during the Rion Olympics when the police performed a controlled explosion task.
Police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The public came in when the police had controlled the explosion package.
The public did not record the view by the start of the match, because the police closed the arena because of a suspect package found to be an assault.
The police exploded the package and released the public administration only after that.
Pompeo raised the matches with a dream to begin with the Spanish team.
With two losses, Spain won Nigeria's 96-87 score.
In the previous two battles, Spain gained silver.

Argentinian lady rushed to Syria - Finnish protests
The storm in Petra-Sirena had a colorful competition day in Riga.
The storm of Petäjä-Siren was severe on Thursday.
The Argentinian lady hit the wind of Petra-Sirene on Thursday in Rio at the start of the day of women’s surfing.
The wind was broken.
The opponent admitted the break.
He stayed drunk because of the coach, and others fled, Finnish chief coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete has been considering the protest for a long time.
It shouldn’t be done because it would have been unfair according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund, Petäjä-Sire said.
The Finnish climbed on the floor until the last time, because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of Rion.

7 Special Things that Scientificly Enlarge the Age
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to the life of a person.
Some of the things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life extends.
Sometimes things that a person can’t affect himself can bring him extra beds.
Such are, among other things, the tendency to middle-class obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always need to beat - just a milk cup is enough.
The secret of a long age has been attempted to explore many different studies.
Medical Daily presented the seven most strange results of the study.
According to science, all of these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking Cake and Coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to protect against cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A study at Harvard University found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with "reduced death risk", particularly with regard to neurological or heart diseases.
For alcohol, studies say that reasonable use - one of three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that winemakers lived older than people who didn’t drink at all.
Regular use of teeth can extend the life of a person for more than six years, a study says.
The claim is based on that it prevents sensational inflammation.
They can also contribute to the emergence of other diseases elsewhere in the human head.
A study in Norway found how laughing had an impact on human life.
The seven-year project was monitored by more than 45,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to live after the experiment.
Sex, when the protection from gender diseases is observed, is for health, according to many studies.
In addition, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order to get extra beds in his life, he also needs to get an orgasm.
Movement, of course, brings additional years, it is not going to be disputed.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute legality.
A study at the University of Oxford found that women with a large backbone were lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these aspects to low mortality.
Whether it’s the Olympic medal player or the Oscar-winning actress, he is more likely to live longer than the usual.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life extra years.
Some researchers again suspect that the long age is once again due to the social status of a person - which, for example, contributes to the achievement of Nobel Prize recognitions.
A study of shopping behaviour over 65 years of age found that a daily shopping person is less likely to make shopping a parent.
This is because rotating in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to break down biological mechanisms that may slow down death.
Therefore, count your credit card from your hands - the online shop does not have the same effect.
Umpihuma’s railroad driver jumped to the truck
In particular Finland, a serious truck and a person’s nockleader took place on Friday evening.
The accident occurred between the Koske, Touch and Sorvaston Road on Friday at 21.00.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forss, when the passenger car that came against had been deployed in the same box, parting the truck in the right corner.
After the collision, the truck stayed upstairs, but burned.
The driver managed to cut off the fire himself.
The car climbed over the roof, and from the front to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who transported a car remained under pressure in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the University Center Hospital of Turin.
The result of the woman's explosion test was 2.02 promille.
He is suspected of a severe rail drink.
Posts sent out to the wrong city
There were shortcomings in the K-Citymarket's resignation of cancer as the mail had delivered some of the load damaged to the Winter River.
Teija Haltia, who was in Pernius, was on Thursday purchasing exit tickets from the Salon K-Citymarket, when it turned into a fun cold.
Unfortunately, there are shortcomings because Posti delivered our cargo to the Senegal River!
We'll get more when Posti gets the cargo delivered!
If you don't crash in the crash, read coldly.
The cooling shop is associated with the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to also apply to food cutting.
It is always available in the post until the end of August.
Haltian believes the cold was mostly interesting and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in a hurry.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention drawn by this matter is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday evening, the Haltian update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got his own favourite touched on his left-handed pocket, although a few camps were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of the Post’s Corporate Transport Services, regretted the damage to the Night of Sanoma.
The background is that three out of five tables of yesterday were disappointed in the wrong place (the Sun River) and we were no longer going to make the submissions (Salon) with three, but we only took five tables today, Kaidesoja told the evening-Sanom.
This is the first news of the evening.
Teija Haltia didn’t get stunned by the cold because she found all of her own favorites from the selection.

Hope for a woman murdered in Loviisa family: Remindments of victims for the sake of police dogs
A week ago, the 42-year-old family of a woman who was killed in Loviisa wishes the victim to be remembered instead of flowers and addresses by donating for the police work.
Sipoon’s Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it provides the victim’s family’s wish to give a gift to police dogs for the sake of the family.
The publication says that the victim had done the Sipoon as a veterinary station, and also performed his nurse training there.
The veterinary station remembers women with words that touch.
Enjoyable, smart, humorous, and unfeasible work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes the account number where donations can be transferred.
The update notes that grant funds are entirely going to the police dogs, primarily for the acquisition of safeguards.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovish woman was murdered at her home in Lovish Koskenkyl.
Women's neighbours have said that the victim was very animal.
He possessed several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, cannons and flowers.
A 27-year-old suspect of the murder did not know a woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was injured by a police dog Börje, who was injured in a life-threatening detention situation.
But the bull remained alive and is recovering.
The Court of Appeal issued a judgment on breach of equality law to Post
The post was not entitled to retain the wage of the employee who refused to retire the renter, Kanta-Hämee’s Court of Appeal in its judgment.
The Court of Appeal obliged Post to pay the employee most of the wage held and €2,000 for discrimination.
According to the sentence, Posti could have detained the householder's wage only from a part that corresponded to the part of the householder's work throughout the day.
According to the Court of Appeal, the employee was placed in a more unfavorable position on the basis of his vocational association on the contrary to the equality law.
The employee had respected the Postal and Logistics Union of the PAU organization’s decision on a ban on familiarisation.
During last November of the post office, PAU made a decision that the employees of the Post wouldn’t stop hiring employees.
It was the news of the people first.
Returning to the path of respect for human rights in Turkey

Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the situation in Turkey for human rights.
In the past, the Journalist Union called on Sipil and Sonia to express their concerns for the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland has repeatedly imported into Turkey the importance of press and freedom of expression.
Putin separated the head of his administration - the state of the Estonian Vaino
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has separated President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin.
Soviet-Estonia Communist leader Karl Vaino is the son of Anton Vaino.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-Chairman of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
It will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, the news agency Interfax reports.
Vladimir Putin issued a resignation to the Chief of the Government.
Putin's close internal circle, Ivanov, according to the Kremlin newspaper, is moving to the specific tasks on environmental and transport issues.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for transfer to other tasks and proposed Vaino to be in place, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB's spying.
Many considered Ivanovi as possible Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin was re-electioned as president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant deal for a game ban - can't be seen in the opening of the election league
The world recorder of football transfers cannot be seen on the field when the England election is deported during the weekend.
Paul Pogba's film ban was accompanied in England.
Manchester United's giant dealer Paul Pogba is on the side of ManU's opening league against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said Friday.
According to the UK, ManU paid Pogba's Italian expansion to Juventuks for EUR 105 million.
However, the English Football League FA keeps him away from the game, because Pogba has remained a game ban on Juventus.
He got two warnings in the Italian Cup last season, and it will be a game ban.
The ban was transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
The next game is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
Flow's greatness is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have stabilized the status of Flow Festival as an internationally recognized event highlighted by world top artists.
The Flow Festival begins on Friday in Helsinki.
The festival visitors are typically expressed in their own costume.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is stagnated amongst other things with a workpiece and art installations.
It has never been enough for us to have only a headquarters and a knife,” said the artistic director of the event, Thomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will be held this weekend in the Helsinki Summer Valley, has grown from the small card history to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question in the background of success: What factors would you like to go to?
In the event, it is quite different to think about this.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of need and to be delivered in accordance with authority orders, said the artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would end this year to sell.
The goal was to increase the number of 70,000 visitors last year by 5,000 souls.
The festivals will also be seen this year with a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing because it is necessary to finance somehow.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a cattle, which is guided in a huge ride.
That's what we don't want.
In the course of 13 years, the ideology of the successful event has been overwhelmed so that there are 130 participants in the partly-runed area, art installations, as well as numerous restaurants and drink bars.
In addition to the main and smaller streams of incidence, this year, 15,000 people have a tent.
Stone admits that the event could be done more simply.
Maybe I'm a little big, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If it disappears, this is no longer our case.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done for the stone is that large visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-20th century, the operation was very dependent on the aid of about EUR 20 000 in Helsinki.
Last year, Flow’s shareholders’ turnover was about six million euros.
It allows you to create “class things,” such as the building of a tent of 73 meters wide.
Flow's visitors are typically expressed in their own clothing.
Along with the music event, you can also talk about the trendy adult community of young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as a particular fashion.
We want to be separated, first of all, from content.
However, fashion phenomena also match the Flow’s value world: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the legend of the punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan team in his own genre, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rabbit, and soula in a combined festival that is the most typical event.
Iggy was busted because it's probably the last time we see this in the dark in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what commercial radio calls.
Iggy's last album is fucking good, and he's been doing fucking good stuff in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower boxes - tourists escaped in terror
In Hua Hin, local time exploded two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently covered in the flower box and exploded with mobile phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists were starting to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police representative Samoer Yoosumra told CNN.
Since 1989, wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted about the attacks with a lot of talk.
If the TV doesn't look right, you can see it here.
At least 11 injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran to me and said that the bomb was exploding at the bars.
It took place in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish director Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon afterwards, the Finnish preferred on the island of Phuket, two bombs exploded.
No one knows he's dead.
At the same time, another double bomb was shot in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, one bomb was explosed in Trang City.
Police said they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are probably rebel forces behind the bombs that are not satisfied with the action of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also be the case with criminal organizations.
Aftonbladet said the police have recently been arrested in the activities of criminal organizations that are dealing with trafficking in humans.
KSML: This part of the new ready-made forces starts in the first battle in the military situation
In an acute situation, warriors are only ordered to fight for a few months after a military swearing, says Central Finland.
According to General Jukka Sonnisen, for example, in the military situation, the Defence Force Training Chief, who is interviewed by the newspaper, are only eligible for fighting at the final stage of their training.
According to the training manager, reserves are first assigned to the service.
None of the guards or reserves are ordered to do the task for which no required training has been given, says Sonninen.
Earlier in the summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin to train craftsmen in immediate capacity units from next year.
The units can be used in military operations, if necessary, already during equipment training.
Pamela Tola receives huge compensation from home
Actress Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a hard dispute in the apartment they purchased from Espoo in 2009.
The two-storey trade price was EUR 330 000.
However, after the trade, a serious humidity problem was revealed at home, causing a health-threatening microbial growth.
The pair had to be sold as an excavator of the apartment in 2014.
The sales price was up to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Warom was raised to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case and asked for a discount from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the courts and the courts.
The court issued a judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It was in force of the court's judgment, which ordered the seller to pay a price discount of EUR 150,000 to Tola and Rome.
In addition, the seller will have to replace the court and clearance costs of a pair of EUR 47,344.
The right was reasonable to lower prices a bit because the need for a certain housing was already known to buyers when they were making a cottage.
However, the construction errors argued by the law were significantly more serious than was stated.
Tola is looking for a good home.
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically searched for a well-being home because they did not want to make repairs.
He had the idea that the building has been fixed and in good condition and that there is no harm to the matters mentioned in the rehabilitation inspection report.
The rehabilitation inspection report referred to as risks and inaccessible ventilation and the lack of control of water and rainfalls along the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, there was no evidence that it would have been no urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma had the idea that rainwater from the rock should be somewhat controlled within a few years.
The stores were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious.
Audits conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the building found microbial growth, which, according to the Witnesses, were due to both the rainwater and the capillary rise of the earthquake.
The air polluted by microbes on the west side of the house was estimated by the inspector to access the interior through the coating.
A home or hideout cross-border values were found in the samples of the home care room, the lounge door, the lounge window, and the lounge washing room.
The terraces were built without permissions
The law also questioned whether the apartment was extended in violation of the building permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the city of Espoo that was made against the permit.
Among other things, the terraces were built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the copyright law, on the basis of the information received by the seller before the trade, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for measured repairs in the future.
Tola and Waroma believe that there was no particular reason for a broader standard inspection.
Buyers have not forgotten their reporting obligation, the law of court is noted in their judgment.
Charming archive: Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to Nazis - in the registry also Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in his recent article about how microfilm documents are stored in the National Archives of Maryland in the United States about a total of 218,500 women wishing to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish women, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnish women, and 31 Swedish women.
Documents and registry cards originate from a Nazi-German racial agency.
Heinrich Himmler, SS Director of the Rate Agency.
No SS man in Nazi-Germany received children before he had been investigated by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women have been conducted gynecological studies to investigate the matter.
The racial agency examined women’s backgrounds by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the gender of women.
Women should also be willing to abandon their Swedish citizenship and give the racial agency handwritten lifestyles and good recommendations from close friends.
The racial agency wanted to ensure that women were "children", "savings" and "good national socialists" who were well able to speak German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the wedding of SS men.
There is no way to tell us how 14 Finnish women were found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a state-supported program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The program also stipulated that each SS husband should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
Lifeborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the program has not been very actively advanced, the U.S. Holocaust Museum pages are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State encouraged marriage spending by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother’s honour was awarded to women who had received at least four children.
Marriages between "Aryans" and "No-Aryans" in Nazi-Germany were prohibited by law, on museum pages.

Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was posted in a couple of hours of night: "I was so clothed"
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorites for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who is the best-selling solo artist in Finland and the star of the dancers and festivals, continues to broke from the bar in 1995 to tango, and is still at the right rise.
The book written by Mari Koppise on the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana was published on Thursday.
In the book, Silankop tells about his life and career both in good and in bad.
The bridge's career rose to a total rise when he won the Tango Corona in the Tango River Seinäe in 1995.
In the cat Sillanpää sang tangs, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had drawn to Sillanpää at the request of a man a tangocap, which Kassu Halonen fits in a slightly different form.
The Satulinna chapter became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
In the book, however, the sound of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanhead sang it to the band in a terrible crash and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so tired!
The bridge is remembered in the book.
As a huge hit, the recording of the song wouldn't be thought to be singing in the crap.
Although I wasn’t physically my best, the trace was still good.
I learned that all the time I don’t have to demand complete and superiority.
Another incident related to the most popular songs of the man, which is reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013 Sillanhead separated from his partner, and the case finally ended with the gold chapter you deserve, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Saara Törmäss were not the same as Sillanpää wished.
The bridge had imagined he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the song that tells the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the newspaper, Jar and his ex-love were the reasons for Jar’s excessive celebration and alcohol abuse, but Jar said that it was a full puppy and did not think it was true.
According to the book, Jari was angry with the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it - and well so.
In June, the British were surprised by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters had half a difference and 48 per cent had remained in the Union, although the vote week's opinions predicted the opposite outcome.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of remaining in the EU.
No appreciated research institute or university has flagged the difference on behalf of a couple of individual researchers, although a couple of individual researchers had to agree with the vast stream of their profession.
The theme of former U.S. President Bill Clinton's later election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" flew to the brexit band in the UK's Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the main thing in politics.
Economical language
The Centre for Macroeconomics in its last month’s interview with the professional will find answers to the Brexit catastrophe.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened because this time voters made a decision on other than financial grounds.
One of the economics’ explanations for the loss of the economy is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the imagination that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employees, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right away from the UK.
Many also have the idea that the decline in currency value would be a good thing because it promotes export industry.
According to the Economist, voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficient.
They were dismissed, in particular, by the equality of the BBC, which gave just a few percent of the EU’s profitable economists as well as the overpowering majority.
The EU has not been interested in telling me what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other mixtures of economic mathematics are of the consequences.
These remote literature mixtures spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, state debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, then they were not interpelled, because economists represent a elite with which voters don’t have their own interests.
Academics such as economists would have remained in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument for the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants take your job, immigrants crash your hospital, immigrants use you.
These arguments were stuck.
Each cafe has foreign employees.
How much more jobs would have in the UK if they left?
In each health centre’s waiting room there are immigrants.
How much easier does the UK get medical time if they don’t?
In every school there are children of immigrants.
How much easier can true British children get a school if they get rid of it?
In every city there are foreigners.
How much more space would be for the starters if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them, and if they failed, their response was not visible.
Economists have failed to explain that thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, less health centers and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the net payers of the UK's public economy and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen’s real estate fund is ready for Brexit with cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investment by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen was scheduled to make Brexit in time by developing A and B plans.
The plan B, i.e. the EU-profit camp, began to be prepared for the victory of a few weeks prior to the vote in order to leave the result.
The concern was that investors were starting to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have measured liquid funds, but now they might be necessary.
We went to raise cash resources.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund’s cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen’s only openness daily notably about the real estate fund that news concerns.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The value of the fund was 3.5 billion pounds at that time.
The value of the company’s funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest amount in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen about all open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the low amount of cash in these funds remained to ten percent or even below it.
The real estate funds were prepared for a very different strategy for Brexit.
Funds close trade
When the EU’s profitable camp won, Europe was confused.
However, the shortcomings followed by a vote on the real estate market for two weeks were quite calm, Olden says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the spokesman Mark Carney, CEO of the British Central Bank, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a high risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
They together stealed the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared in 2007 and 2008, says Olden.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to rotate, and after another, the fund had to close its doors.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the cash resources collected, but it was finally forced to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not really close the trade, but changed the price down.
In practice, investors were given time with him to consider whether it is worthwhile to pull money out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't suffer because it would be lost.
It calmed the situation, and most of it revoked the notification.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been a couple of weeks very calm, Olden says.
He notes that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner-European Funds have had nothing similar to it.
However, there were a lot of questions.
Uncertain attention to real estate funds
The oldest believes that the closures of real estate funds traded have gained quite a lot of attention.
Open funds covered by closed funds govern about 4 percent of UK real estate.
The closure of Aberdeen took six days, and the company sold less than ten properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still attached.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds back to the end of 2017.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been cut down, but the situation does not look "warther" for Aberdeen.
Most of the issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, he noted.
The price of pound and dollar is the lowest for 30 years, in addition to having a 15% discount on the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar owner can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are lots of buyers, old says.
Brexit brings downsides to the real estate market in London
In the morning, the situation wasn't really bad yet.
But four, when Pertti Vanhane, responsible for the real estate investments of the British Real Estate Fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
You've got a strong head in it.
I realized that this is going to plan B now, says Olden in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work right away.
London City was completely alive despite the morning night.
The regularly non-sound-adjusted TV panels at the office were reporting news, and normally the people were silent to fully listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stood before the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screens were only red.
It was a morning that he never thought he was alive, says the old man.
Not because, despite the mystery, Aberdeen, one of the UK’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
The sense was confused.
However, the company was well reserved for the option, and therefore the situation was somehow calm, Olden says.
Brexit Voting Starts Repair Movement
The storm followed the vote.
Punta broke, the British leadership went to exchange.
The markets began to predict severe declines on the real estate market in Britain and especially in London.
London’s offices were expected up to 20% mins in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade after one another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the poison is gone, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
However, it doesn’t show up on the faces of the old man who spent this week in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what the Brexit follows.
So much is still open: how the difference is happening and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the real estate market in London has already been obtained.
CBRE’s information on price development covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all real estate prices in London fell 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, a minimum of 6.1% was accumulated, Olden listed.
The numbers are not so horrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have been worse, says Olden.
All equally large falls occurred in the years of crisis 2007 and 2008.
It is also interesting because Brexit was quite quickly compared to Lehman’s fall and the US real estate market to the global economic crisis.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite part of it, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
The sense is another.
The real estate market has now not seen panic sales like that at that time, but willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The funding can also be found normally.
Repair could have been in front of any case.
In fact, it’s not surprising that the price fixing motion could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices for real estate in London and other cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially offices are overpriced, says Olden.
So the fall began very high.
Prices in London have been posted up for four reasons, the Old List.
The UK economy has grown strongly, the London population has grown strongly.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last grade of property that is globalizing, says Olden.
New investors from the Middle East and Asia have become marketed, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as an easy city destination.
In addition, prices have been fed a low interest rate, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to seek revenue for new items.
This loan has been easily available - although the debt fund has been used, according to the Old Testament, now clearly less than during the bum before the 2008 crisis.
Destroy, destroy.
The price rise in London last summer, Olden said.
Aberdeen also began to relief his property in London, and was a net salesman last year.
There was some sort of turning expected, and now it's coming.
What about this?
It depends on how the British national economy is evolving, says Olden.
He is not afraid to judge a lot, but he says that no rise is hardly permitted.
The sense indicates that there is a lower or smooth expense in front.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the cows will survive at work.
If you're ready for the risks well, you're in a better position.
He believes in global dissemination.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of it.
If the risks have been decomposed, the risks have also been decomposed, says Oldenen.
S-group starts registering purchase information more in detail earlier
The S group knows what you are eating, because the trading group has told us that it is starting to collect more detailed information about the purchases of its customers.
As soon as information has been collected about the final amount of the fiber, the group begins to collect it from the products purchased in early May.
The S group will follow this Centre, as the information on the goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in the Centre’s Customer Register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, Ismo Riitala, the feedback received from the program has been mostly positive.
The product specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is licensed to be used for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Rarely the customer has forbidden the use of product information, Riitala tells Econoussanom.
He said that Kesko would not respond to the S-Group registration change.
The centre classifies its stand-alone customers already in ten groups according to mere food supplies.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer support program and has no such plans.
The Finnish Central Store has its own One-Bonus-bank customer program, which can be associated with in Choice Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We are currently not collecting information about product or product group levels, we remain at the end of the fiber amount.
I mean, we know where the purchases were made in the store, and I and the customer will pay the final amount.
We haven’t gone to this level as a group of K or S, says the commercial director Anu Ora.
He believes that the customer's stand-alone program will continue to be reformed in the future, but the Middle Shop will tell this later.
However, it does not allow the registration of product information to be started.
Initially, try
So far, the SOK Customer and Customer Registry has been relatively wide.
The basic information includes not only the personal and address information, but also the profession, education, form of residence, births of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The S-Event card is stored on the date and time of purchase, location, final amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, the information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase information will begin to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismo, Home Terroes and ABC chains, the data is recorded at the product group level.
Customers have long been hoping to be more focused on marketing, said Marjaana Saarikoski, CEO of SOK’s customer service and partner business.
The S group says it is aware of changes to its customers.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information in marketing.
However, the data is stored in any case, whether or not.
A desired person can check their deposited information from the website of the S Group.
For example, cats cannot access information, Saarikoski emphasizes.
Video: Heila-pentu is the latest dog reinforcement in the Customs - the pen becomes the first explosive dog
The black labrador pickup will strike five similar boxes placed on the ground on the Helsinki-Vantan airport.
It does not take a long time when it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs officer Lassi Suntio rewards her Heila dog for playing with her favorite game.
From the box next to which Heila was sitting, there was a debris that were pushing to the rutial gas.
Ruticus gas is the first smell with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online shops
Heila is the first dog specialized in searching for weapons and explosives in Tull and will be located to work at Helsinki-Vantan airport next year.
The tasks may also be carried out by Heila and Suntion to other cross-border areas and ports.
However, the airport will become Heila's main job because the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels caused customs measures, and after the attacks, the control has been confirmed, according to Customs superinspector Mikko Grönberg.
Another reason for access to the training of a gun and explosive dog in the duties of the customs are posts through Helsinki-Vantan.
With an increase in online trade, up to 40 million postal messages pass through the airport every year, including items and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs duty has made the discovery of online shops in Helsinki-Van Airport, including about 300 luggage items, weapons, parts, gunfire and explosives, and their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki-Vantata.
It will investigate registered luggage and postal shipping.
The ports will have a great benefit in the future, when it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more accurate research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, the Customs assess whether more weapons and explosives will be trained in the future.
Groenberg is looking forward to thinking.
School in the Church
Heila-pennu training is the coordinator of the dog’s Tull School located in Kirkkonumme.
Subio will also be trained with Heila with the police and the Defence Forces experts.
Police have strong experience in dog training and the Defence Forces expertise in explosives.
Together with other authorities, the customs authorities decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Healy, we are always going to continue as needed, says Grönberg.
Helan colleagues in Helsinki-Vanta have six drug dogs in Tullin as well as money and drug dog Mass.
Labradorinducer Heila has been selected from ten dog locks.
The selection criteria for a dog chosen at the airport include racing and hunting, as well as peace, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosions and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend to the customs officer, but also a family member.
Nothing goes home without Heila, Suntio laughs.
Beautiful commandments go to Heila from the garden.
The Sunshine cameraman loses no protection of the camera for a quick dog, but Heila restores the protection that appears to be soft toys immediately from the "hit" view.
Hard Competition of Tools
Primary training will be completed next year.
There will be further stage tests in the next October, which will assess whether training is adequate for demanding tasks.
Heilan can be seen in Helsinki-Vanta in the next year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travellers can’t come to slide the dog on the workplaces, Suntio recalled.
The cost of one work dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their work age is about seven to eight years, even ten years after which they will be retired to the care of their owner.
The working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but the active work lasts only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of the tools is a hard competition.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 customs employees.
Luckily, Suntion had no work dog before, but he had years of experience with dogs and controls in Tullis.
Mini state gets its first Olympics - people get a free day
The rugby Olympics in Fiji with less than a million residents are so high that the government has been appointed to be a national holiday on August 22th.
According to the public radio company, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after its resolution.

Even in Chinese restaurants, the game was watched, I heard their encouragement, said Fiji Times reporter Michael Seru Guardian.

RoPS acquires viral attacker Prosan - Operations League - Evening-Sanomat
Rovaniemen Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has concluded a lasting deal with the official attacker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniem is small.
With more than 10 players, we went through 50 players from all over the world.
The small group began to be a good alternative to Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in the newspaper.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from a rural Flora, where he made a total of 51 paintings in 109 matches.
He also played in the Estonian team.

Dangerous Modern Family star again: teenagers shorts reveal almost everything
The modern Family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, who has become acquainted with Ariel Winter, re-exhibits a threat to his arm.
Winter was depicted in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don’t leave a lot of imagination in stock.
Shorts reveal not only the foot of the actor but also this backbone.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing its style and behavior significantly more boldly.
The star has posed on social media in its publications in very few images of clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dressing in very nude homes.
Winter on the Adults threshold has also recently published several pictures of themselves at the celebration.
If the picture doesn't appear, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from an adult child star.
He has been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
She has learned that the more she appears to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention she gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter began staying in the Moderni Family series only 11 years old.
The actor has denied some of his long-term fans in his image change.
It’s not hard to figure out where he’s in 10 years when he’s already getting so hard, a woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans are defending the actor and calling for her to be without a criticism.
You look great!
It's the same as others say.
You're inspired for many women, you're a young woman.
Japanese prefer Northland - tourists are attracted to retreat: Autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start revolts from the beginning, Visit Finland says in the newspaper.
The chiefs of the Japanese revolt competition are Inari and Levi.
Revonuts are our winter tourist cards, and they are strongly combined with heart winds and snow landscapes.
In the winter of the lap, rebound dishes are in good demand, but we are now trying to increase the sale of autumn trips.
It’s rare to know that the revolution season starts early in the autumn and continues long until the spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, in which the surface of the lake reflects the revolts by making the vision of the two floors of a port, says in the newspaper Visit Finland, see marketing chief Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group of revolt campaigns are rich 25-35 years old, Japanese women living in the city who are looking for tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland through online ads.
According to a survey conducted by the University of Aalto and by researchers from the University of Turin and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of Japanese compared to other North countries.
However, the Japanese missed more clear unique attractions from Finland, and this retreat, according to Linda, has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese travellers have grown more in Finland.
Last year, they spent more than twice in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
As a destination group for tourism, the Japanese are interested in spending more than €80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind said.
Britain had to be satisfied with their silver at the rugby 7 match when Fid's championship team won gold
The impactful success of the UK's seven players in the rugby game broke up when Fidzi won it on Thursday at the Rion Deodoro Stadium in the final of chapters 43-7.
Fidzi gave the master’s teachings in ball treatment, transfers, side-training, support games, runways and rawa’a, and thus won gold – if it was the first Olympics in his entire history.
The loss represented silver, which was a slightly larger loss for Britain, because it was the third country’s silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as Olympics for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strict win from the South African Boks in the seven to five semi-finals earlier the same day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
However, Fidzi's team in this form would have won the British, even though the 15-speaking team would have been in full power.
The UK may encourage at least one British to get a golden necklace tomorrow: Fid’s chief coach Ben Ryan, former English rugby 7 team coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been pretty good for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Ria, they lost only one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is annoying.
Fidzi began excellently and presented his talents to the UK as a pleasure.
It seemed like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had hit the buses that were moving on, and the world champions went up to 5–0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
When the clock was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai made a second painting to the right place of the paint box.
The situation 12–0, and the UK had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell’s magnificent taklaus prevented Leone Nakarawa from making a third paint, but it didn’t slow Fid’s journey long.
After the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the painting in the right corner, after which Britain was 17–0 lost.
Nakarawa made a second post-initiation painting, where the first half-time game was still more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravou broke through the former unpowered tablas of the UK team and broke over the painter line.
After the paint break, the opening period ended with the situation 29–0.
It seemed that the Fijis were born to play seven players rugbya, while the British are still in the classroom role.
Whatever must be true.
The United Kingdom made large changes in half and managed to arrest the Fijis for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisova made the painting thanks to the excellent Fiji team.
Dan Norton managed to turn the situation into 36–7 by making the painting to the left of the UK, but the game had long been lost for the Southern Islanders whose fans were singing, climbing tickets and danced.
Fid's pure joy was difficult to admire.
Mata Viliame made an end to the fidzish cake by making the painting in the last moments.
The pilli of soya, the fiddles, and the British fell into the field, perfectly broken.
In the previous day, Fidzi had won Japan’s semi-final chapters 20–5 and the United Kingdom had been overweight in a strict South Africa semi-final, where the situation would solve the British paint strike.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxes on the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the paint line with his stunning footwork and crashed under the paint balls on the other half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson of England's 15-player rugby team, won the victory and finally won the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to swallow gold
It couldn’t be more important to have gold in these cats.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, 220 winning hits in history and found an additional goal for their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
While they were in the boat, they were on the boat with the third coach Robin Williams voice, which encouraged them to the second consecutive Olympic gold of women in two, which makes them the first women in the history of British sports that overcome the same achievement.
Their overpower was uncontroversial, the win was already 39th successive and recorded again.
What we see, two great athletes connecting to the water surface as you are old, does not fully match the nature of success.
There is a large number of helping hands behind each of them, each of which has taken twice as far as achievements. However, the main part of the coach is a coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who did not know if he would see this day.
Williams said that the situation was strict at the time.
“I had urinary cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been a bad time.
It changes a bit of thought.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The three were lucky in terms of Williams being able to start the treatment of the species outside of the seasonal period in early 2014, causing the interruption as little as possible, if this could be said under such circumstances.
“I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters once they said a few steps were enough.
That's where it starts.
It’s already a journey, but it made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after victory, the two thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous momentum and spoke a little more normally trying to overcome their own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Tissue Press, who had a retreat to Afghanistan, said: "I have been a remarkable ruin this week, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much."
“It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we have worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in the box of Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so with great gratitude to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to work with, or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The two have found a powerful rhythm for which their competitors have failed to draw comparisons.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the two of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
“We were very much caught at the moment.
Helen: "Pysy, stay with you."
It’s very important not to get away from the route.”
“We succeeded in departing well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We didn’t achieve the heavens today, we just wanted to do a good fight and win the cat that we did.”
Two thoughts a year before deciding on their future.
Glover will celebrate the next month with Steve Backshall.
Now he just wants to enjoy a moment.
“I didn’t want to say this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
After London, it took about six months before I realized that I was an Olympic player.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time the consciousness took about four minutes.
This feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland replaces the Panama Years’ Government
In October, Iceland will organize early parliamentary elections, which are required by protesters in the Panama Information Years already in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed taxes circulated by several Icelandic politicians through tax paradise.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced due to the scandal, but it was not enough for the demonstrators.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to organize new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date is now decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the last rage of the people affects the autumn election results.
In the presidential elections in June, the criticism of the enormous ones appeared clearly, and the president was elected outside of the policy to be conditioned by Gudni Johannesson.
Trump said he was sarcastic claiming Obama to be the founder of Isis
U.S. Republican President Donald Trump revoked his latest hardships.
He said he was sarcastic claiming that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization of ISIS and Democratic President Hillary Clinton's part of the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry with the talks and asked for apology from Trump.
The commander of the Army should never let anyone who can walk down there, Clinton said.
The Mayor of Cannes in South France has banned the use of bulkini swimming clothes that cover Muslims’ favorites on swimming pools, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The Mayor David Lisnard’s signature decision states that swimming and shoreline is forbidden for all who have no good way of swimming and secularism.
The decision also states that swimming pools, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of order disturbances in France, which has been subject to terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds of injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old went to the French National Day for the party.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations connected to the Father attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over the age of 80.
The quality of the swimming waters of the area of Oul crosses the sea - Pyykösjärvellä bluesamentuma
The water samples taken from the official swimming pools of the Oulu area meet the quality requirements set for swimming water.
Only by the swimming pool of Pyykös Lake has been detected a blue beam.
The Oulu District Environmental Action took water samples on Tuesday and Wednesday from nine EU coasts and 30 other general swimming pools in the Oulu District area.
Except for the beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcus bacteria in all swimming waters undermined the measures laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social and Health.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococcus in seafood water were ensured on Wednesday, when the concentrations of bacteria were lower than the limits of action.
The blue seam detected by the swimming lake does not yet make water swimless, but under favorable circumstances the situation can quickly become a blue seam, forming the surface of the water as a blue-green flour.
Environmental action monitors the situation by the narrowed examination.
If the blue pot becomes a blue pot, it will also be informed separately in the Swimming Table.
See the results of the swimming water samples here.
MTK's Hakkara gift reduction: more than 80 % of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the budget proposal by the Ministry of Finance next year.
The tax law proposes a tax reduction which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax for the forest deposit generation exchange.
In the proposal by the Ministry of Finance, the reduction of forest gifts has four objectives: promoting the generational exchanges of forest farms, youthing the age structure of forest owners, increasing the size of forests and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
Forest owners would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
Overall, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generational exchanges of forestry plants is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, director of the Central Forestry and Land-Forestry Association (MTK).
However, Hakkarin finds critical of the tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts shall be submitted by the forest owner's net capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other reductions have been reduced.
According to MTK and Hakkara, the effect of tax reduction would be higher if the reduction could be made directly from the wood sales revenue.
In the VM's proposal, a reduction in forestry net capital revenue prevents the loss of forestry capital revenue, which should be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would have a tax benefit even if he didn't sell a tree.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average forest owner is unable to figure it out, says Hakkarainen.
In addition, the model concerns only a small portion of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit associated with the yield value of the forest is EUR 40,000 in the proposal.
It has been pulled out of Hakkara's view to too high.
According to him, 82 percent of Finnish forest owners are dismissed from the reduction circle.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest owners, he says.
In the VM, the border is considered to guarantee the goal of growing space.
Forest policy has been deducted for decades according to Hakkaraise.
In the background is the ageing of the forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful railroad surprised the Himanga drivers - two cars jumped into their wheels and collided with each other
The fish in Himanga took a special retreat on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive cars dropped into a wheel, after which your collision came after the time above.

In the back of the car, two people were transported to the hospital.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver wasn't injured before.
The accident occurred in the kingdom of 8 Himalayans a few kilometers away from the Fisheries.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research findings from the University of Turin can help develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings made by the Academic Professor Johanna Ivaska Group show that the severity of cancer cancer increases the malignacy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was able to prevent under laboratory conditions by restoring cancer surrounding tissue to respond to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be able to improve by concentrating on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells in their treatment.
The research results were published on 4 August in the journal Nature Communications valued in the field of cell biology.
The treasure of the family rape continues in the cave, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence to another prosecutor
The tree of the Much’s family house will continue in the hook for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for a family crime in Muhoks.

The ice is the world’s longest backbone, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s most lively spine is a secure ice cream, a study published in the journal Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the floating ice cream around Greenland, the holker can live up to the age of 400.
The woman grows only at the age of 156.
Ice life adds that it only grows a centimeter per year.
Only one simbolica is known to live ice cream longer.
The researchers found their age by radiocarbon limitation.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some smells had radioactive residues.
Based on this, researchers were able to evaluate the age of the disease.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years - however, the drop in the direction or in the other can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Visa - People's News
Donald Trump does not need to change the world.
Up to a third of all state tax revenue would be left unless Donald Trump’s property changes to corporate tax.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, with the most beneficial tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as a revolutionary showing it on Monday in Detroit.
The company's tax will decrease from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, it would really be a shameful amount of $1 billion a year.
The total income tax rate is now 39.6, following Trump’s reduction of 33.
The legacy tax would be totally handed over.
Trump accused the state of too much regulation in business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The enacted environmental standards for disasters must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be dismantled.
Barack Obama’s health care reform must be taken into consideration.
The administration must designate "experts instead of bureaucratic".
“Devastating” trade policy, Trump said, is the biggest cause of U.S. problems.
Free trade agreements would be rejected.
Imports from China would be taxed by 45 per cent and 35 per cent from Mexico.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our religion, Trump declared.
Donald Trump does not need to change the world:
American cars are coming to drive on the streets, American airplanes to connect cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds throughout the country.
By way of deviation, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, despite the fact that well-organized protests stopped it 14 times.
Economists - also close to Republicans - see the U.S. taking Trump's programme to deep economic growth.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program on Friday in Finland’s time.
Assassination of the past - People's News
The sea is destitute, but the real attack attacks in the middle of Madrid's streets - the account with the past can begin.
This is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s novelty.
Almodova’s previous guidance work Travellers (2013) was a small and rush-skinned satiary comedy, preceding it in which the tops of the career of the Spanish artist live in (2011).
Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is a perfect room for love, human relationship and family, in the center of the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is a simplicity and is seen a lot of long backwards.
Life seems to be modeled with a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then all threatens to climb.
A new man (Dario Grandinetti) must always be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a back and long letter, Julieta once stages her life into her adult daughter.
She starts with the time before her daughter’s birth, the moment when she met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta rises to the other woman’s headquarters as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series The Time between Ommelten (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a cake, but I myself would say that time is screaming and pronounced with a single age.
For Almodóvar films, there is always a fair distance in Juliet after so much humor.
It is uniformly played, quiet, a place in place that contains good music and a very sad movie, with such materials in its elegance.
Instead, the Spanish director has a typical visual colorfulness in stock and so it begins to put a little silence in the eye more purely than acting as a dramatic effective eye.
People in the film experience diseases, deaths, or just sudden losses, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies in particular to the dress: in the case of a name, the residents change from stage to stage, and the same applies to the apparent earnings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the motion of each stage is not particularly focused on this.
Mechanically repeating, the influence is external and slightly breathless.
Almodóvar has made the script on the basis of three novels of the 2013 Nobel Prize awarded Canadian Alice Munro.
Novellits has been published in the work of The Witness: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in literary filtration of a slight equality.
Before that, the subjects would have been emotionally unparalleled with the drama, with a lot of big things - especially the sharp guilt - about the theme of Leffa.
Directed and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munron's three novels.
Mainly: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first day of the film is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
New operations will not be made, the ministers will be defeated, so that the basic Finnish will not be totally broken.
However, cuts made in the spring are made on the rop.
There will be no new operations.
The estimated four billion savings are enough.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) are convinced under the budget.
It is true that the VM's proposal does not have new operations as social security operations have already been decided in the spring framework.
Children, national retirement, unemployment base and almost all other national retirement index privileges are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment in the amount of income is shortened from 500 days to 400 days.
Training cuts continue.
Removal choices
Why are the ministers so insisting that there are no new operations on them?
The next year is the election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and they are the main heat meter in the election, not the gallons.
First of all, it has been seen that the results of the municipality in different directions of the Government have been disrupting the state's mood for a long time.
However, the Gallups say that the Government of Central Finland is expecting a loss of smoke, although the result of its previous elections was unexpected by 12.3 per cent compared to the presidential elections.
Five years ago, the basic Finnish received 752 new authorisations, most of which will realize the price of influence in the right administration next spring.
In three directions, the lifestyle of the government of the same large party is in place that the position of the basics of the Romanians endures.
It hasn't endured, but more than half of the votes have been required by government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the visit to the party's representative group have also come to the surface.
The new operations will not come with the retoric, first of all, the fact that they will be carried out in the next year, and second attempts to soften the expected attack of the basic Finnish people.
Great operations in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different - if the Government of Sipil is still in position.
The government has set a target for the debt qualification at this election period, but the debt in the budgeting of Petteri Orpon will be taken over EUR 5.9 billion next year, or more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the election period and to admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt debt is not fighting or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means that for the former, there will be even more tough operations in the 2017 budget.
The budget would be at least close to the balance in 2018, and then in the spring it will be accepted in the elections.
The debt in these actions does not fight.
It is absolutely clear that the debt in the current action did not fight, even if Juha Sipilä attempts to blow a positive atmosphere.
State Secretary Martti Heteeme's reports in the reporting of the budget show that it is unacceptable:
The global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. veto aid from the international economy.
The Finnish national economy has not just risen since the 2008 collapse, not only temporarily during the recovery policy exercised in the early 2010s.
The unemployment has increased by 35 percent over this decade and has been extended from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
The unemployment costs now three billion euros per year more than in 2008.
With immediate reports, the debt of the public sector, which exceeded the 60 percent limit in 2014, will rise to 70 percent in the next half of the decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left Alliance’s debt default was defeated because it was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros next year, which is practically covered by taking a completely new debt.
This is the concept of the center, the meeting, and the basic Finnish of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that daycare, youth work and exercise are responsible for the municipality, according to the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation research.
Clearly, the majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, cultural, civil education, building supervision, high school education and waste care.
In turn, the county’s responsibility is most clearly desired by provincial assistance, special nurse care, vocational training, vocational high schools and institutional care for people with disabilities.
None of the tasks in charge of the municipalities will be transferred to the state.
The underlying railroad runs at the end of the back of the police.
A 16-year-old Joensuu driver fled a police party at Joensus Ilomantsinti on Friday at half a time.
The police party tried to stop the motorcycle running without lights, but the young man went to drive the police with a fair overspeed.
The back drive continues to the Sonkajan coast, from which it continues to the Sorronahonti and to the smaller forest, where the motorcycle went out of the road.
After that, the young man ran away, but a faster police officer ran away.
The drilling test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
He didn’t have a driver’s license that would have been entitled to ride by a motorcycle.
The case is investigated, among other things, by a severe threat to road safety.
The rocks fell down on the ground.
The rainfall in the stone fell on Polvijärv on Kaavinti on Thursday evening at 21.15 p.m.
Rekka had been deployed on the left side of the fold out of the way and fell into the hills.
The rescue agency lifted the injured driver out of the crashes across the top of the door, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first career.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the owner of the vehicle.
From the boat, the hydraulic oil was absorbed by the rescue facility.
Police investigated the cause of the accident.
The old woman disappeared at the Air Force in the afternoon.

Materials of the accident in the air - see the gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The tents of Parafest festivals falling in the flow caused enormous destruction.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will reach its economic footsteps, and the event can also be held next year.
The Parafest's last appearance of Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of Friday at the torilava.
The program will continue on Saturday at the presentations held in the city theater rooms from 13:00 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjo is the Parafest Exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized planned.
The streaming occurs in the fall cloud when the rainwater and its weight start a declining air stream.
Changes in the form of water in the cloud binding heat, and thus the drop in the air will melt and its vapor to the ground will accelerate.
According to the Institute of Science, fluctuations occur in Finland during several summers.
It is difficult to predict the path of attack flows.
Attorney flow attacked the Joensu at the Joensu Museum as Parafest's event place on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people were slightly killing themselves.
Among them was one child who was transported to a seriously injured further treatment.
Air Pollution Aging The British
According to the study, the skin of London is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of aging is air pollution.
According to the British study, Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the Londonist skin of many pensioners is two-and-a-half years older than the aged friend who lives in the rural area.
Small skin-aging particles are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transportation fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londonians die every year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass through the outer layer of the skin.
Cac’s study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those Londonians who are walking on their way to work in the vicinity of rude streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different skins, but more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
Tractor brakes were deceived - working in front of a standing man
The man had moved stones in his backdrop with a tractor.
When he left the tractor and went to the front of it, the tractor brakes were fraudulent and the tractor dropped on the man.
The man didn't stay below it, but the tractor, however, dropped the working man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital for further research, being seriously injured.
The tractor couldn't move longer because it hit the stones in front of you.

Through Josban, Kataya and the Rivers to the U.S. team
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all salibandi championships since 2003.
Now in Tampere, the sixth matches are already going, only in 2013, Canada has been better in North America's cars.
I was working in Turku and playing with women in the sickness when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. had set up a Salibandi country team.
I'm interested in this, and this is what I'm doing now, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppane went to Joensuna University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species has not yet been played at SM level as a salibandy.
The stream was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the Jokipoi Ice Cream in the SM series, Jumppane remembers.
Jumppanen played with the university the salibandy SM series from the 1991-92 season, the following three passed in Josba.
In the course of the game, he trained the A-girls in the championship.
Women's SM series was made up of silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played women in the SM series 10, with a balance in 169 matches 51+34=85.
The last SM year is 2001-2002.

Beach volley artist Essi Hasun round closes Kouvolaan - SM gold lacks a prize prize
Essi Hasu is to stop as a beach volley player at least after the season that passes temporarily.
Beach volley Finland championships will be resolved on weekends at the Kouvolan Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In collaboration with the Kouvolan Airballists and the Finnish Airball Association to organize the SM final tournament, the six best pairs of each series rankings are eligible.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY, grown by Essi Hasu, who has been part of Finland's beach volley tops for several years.
Today, the Hasu in Helsinki is waiting for enthusiastic games in front of the public.
Hopefully, as many as possible will be able to take a look at the weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great arena.
I'm not very often played in adult series in Kouvola, so it's great to play at the finals at the home corner, Hase the mood.
The cowboy mixed Hasun's painful sport and gave good eaves for a great entertainment.
In my mind, childhood is a great reminder.
When I was nine years old, I started flying in the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The top of the mind is too big toys, knees rotating in the neck, as well as high-speed shoes and koreography after a point, Hasu remembers.
In a small area, the sport had a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's joint life created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were actively involved - the father of our teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley has already been a natural selection of species as opposed to the indoor ball.
The swimming pool has been played by a bike since the 1990s.
Activity has always been active.
I also went to follow the junior SM tournament competitions, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this hack occurs when Hasu plays the weekend together with the SM finals of the playlist Anniina Parkkise.
The goal of the second punishment in the tournament is clear after the Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahden.
As a realistic goal, we have a measure.
SM gold is still missing from a prize cabinet, Hasu throws it out of honor.
The presence of a weekend in Kouvola may be the last familiarity with Hasu in front of the public.
In early September, new challenges are expected for civil work.
The international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, the reservoirs are placed on the neck at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli is a brave farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk loans, sand and wisdom.
The young farmer Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in the positive future also in the rural area.
Two years ago, Koli and her younger brother, Valtteri Kol, began to act as their continued home status.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with their own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant debt withdrawal and ordering increases so that the bread could be handed over from agriculture.
This has been from the little ones until my case.
I’ve always been happy with the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur, I’ve put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and well.
In 2013, we started to build a pineapple, and at first the bank wasn’t excited about it.
However, I really bravely joined the project, and I was fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Solomon Kol, who grows meat cars, is to invest in even bigger navels.
The work has resulted because Solomon Koli has been chosen among the top ten in the competition of the young food producers in the journal “The Future of the Rural Land”.
He is currently competing for possible wins.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until 21.8.

Snapchat’s anime host is criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says it was an animate fan of the filter, but some observers believe it is racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play identities in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, dog, or character in Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
The lenses are unpleasant, characteristic tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All misleading steps quickly come to general knowledge.
Snapchat’s lenses have received a review where it is accused of favouring black-face makeup or white-white skin shades as a beauty idea.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into wine, distorted teeth, and made pocket bubbles, some of the reviewers called it a racist cartoonist of Asian people (yellowface).
Assessers also wondered whether these repeated disputes refer to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and anger spread widely on Wednesday and was written by The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat told him to remove the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to be honored for anime hammers, not for the caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some objected firmly to the anime parable.
Korean-American artist Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely distributed, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and tempting".
He added: “It’s hard to object to the extremely unwilling Asian caricature to the effects of the filter.
It shows that the filter is not only "yellowface", but also that which is taken to the degrading extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural wages.
In American culture, there is an endless struggle between diversity and social inclusion, always from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s great audience consists of young people who are more versatile than their parents in exchange for their ethnic backgrounds. This can mean that they are likely to expect even more subtlety.
"When one of the Snapchat lenses creates a picture that violates the user, such things will no longer be very easy to notice as before," Katie Zhu, a 25-year-old, said in an interview Thursday.
Zhu, a product leader and designer in the Media Release, decided on Thursday to remove Snapchat accounts and encourage others to do the same.
In an article published in the media and a telephone interview, he said he believed that conflicts related to ethnicity reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company’s most of the white and only men’s leadership and decided his article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that there are no colorful people in their unilateral personality, so they can make such decisions, or then they also have colorful employees, but their position is not such that they would be inclined to tell their opinion directly and easily," says Zhu, a Chinese-American.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish numbers of its personnel on ethnic backgrounds by paying its position as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss its staff’s ethnic backgrounds, but, according to a reporter, the company has recently hired a recruited employee, aimed at focusing on underdependent groups and promoting inclusion within the company.
In his own contribution, Zhu says that he holds his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this isn’t OK.”
According to the Congress's expert group, military officials distorted Daddy's survey information
The Congress’s expert team published a report on Thursday that U.S. military officials, the Central Command, changed the reports so that they would give an optimistic picture of the war against Dad in Iraq and Syria than what happened on the field to understand.
The Presidents of the Republican Chairman for the House Armed Services Committee of the U.S. Chamber of Representatives founded a working group in the interim reporting on the "complete inadequacy of armed analysts".
Central Command, shortly called Centcom, is the headquarters of the U.S. Army in Tampass, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of polls accepted by senior leaders by Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of US anti-terrorism actions than the facts showed in the field, and were without exception more positive than the analysis of other poll units of the Community," the press release said.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers are suffering when misunderstood analysis is presented to high-level politicians,” California Republican Ken Calvert said.
"Centcom's management port errors extend to the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems of 2014 and 2015, which are included in Central Command’s descriptions and analysis of American actions for training Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that Obama's reports were false, it gives an analytical picture of the idea that Centcom's leaders would have pushed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat caused by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, opinions and congress statements were significantly more positive than the events were actually," the report said.
“For example, Centcom’s official publicly made a statement that a large military launch to regain Mosul could take place in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the rule of Islam.
"After months of research, this is very clear," said the National Republican spokesman Mike Pompeo in a newspaper.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior US Army survey managers manipulated the results of surveys to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.”
The Republicans founded a working group when they knew that analysts had suspicions to manipulate the questionnaire on their fathers.
The report published on Thursday will follow more detailed results as the research continues.
In addition, the superinspector of the Ministry of Defense has launched an investigation into Centcom’s inquiry.
On Thursday, the Democrats of the Committee responsible for the survey of the House of Representatives published their own findings, which were partially identical to the Republican Group’s conclusions.
"Before 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a too limited process to evaluate information on Daddy and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democratic representative of the Committee.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of the survey results, "discovered the morality of analytics" and "considered insufficiently distinctive views".
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House had attempted to press Centcom’s analysts to adapt their conclusions to “a self-defined or political line”.
Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of the survey conducted by the Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported a Pentagon superinspector’s investigation, which was launched as a result of the complaints made by Centcom’s analysts.
In a statement, Pentagon's Officer, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said that the Defence Ministry did not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation was underway.
However, he says: "People sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the inquiry community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation also has other consequence as well as its endeavor to determine whether the US-led bombs have been successful in Iraq and Syria (the allegation made by the increasing number of defence authorities).
However, last year's arguments might question how much President Obama can trust Central Command and that it will give honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other areas of crisis.
The criticism of parental surveys responds to the disputes arising from more than a decade ago when Centcom’s survey analyst Gregory Hooker published a survey that, despite the oppositions of many analysts, President George W. Bush’s government, only supports a small group of people in Iraq and spends a little time on what the country’s thought was.
Hooker also played a key role in the rivalry on Dad’s information.
Last year, the Hooker Working Group concluded that despite opposition to public opinions, expressions to the ISIS-governmental warehouses did not significantly deteriorate the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary warehouses and could thus sell oil on the dark markets.
However, the results of the study were not transferred to the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, became critical last year after many legislators had assessed the testimonial statements given to the Senate as too positive for war.
General Aust retired in April, and his position as commander of the Central Command, General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins the fourth double fight in women's land hockey and consolidates its position in inter-disambiguation with the UK
After making three paintings in the winning game, Katie Bam made the first two paintings in the U.S. country hockey team on Thursday, where the U.S. won India.
Five paintings in two games could be considered a great achievement, but a 27-year-old Bam wasn't sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
“I don’t have any idea,” he says.
"I don't belong to people who like the numbers of their paintings."
However, he knows this: Americans have won four Olympic games and lost zero games and shared their first position with Britain, which continued to win Japan’s 2–0 episodes on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States are playing the opposite Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Each team survived the final match that decides, one of which will be located in six teams for the first and the second block.
The first place to avoid meeting a longer time with a hard-trained Dutch team who won the second block.
Regardless of how much the game is going on on Saturday, Americans have already raised their surprising success in these games four years after the last 12 teams left at the London Olympics.
Bam was also in the team in London.
She grew up in Blue Bell in the Pennsylvania state and first caught her land hockey at only 3 years of age (her parents were playing species at Drexel). She was 16 years of age and was the youngest land team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympics stayed with him when he did not survive the final list of players.
Afterwards, 2012 games came where he and his team did not see any success.
The next year he was appointed coach by the Englishman Craig Parnham, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental and physical,” says Bam.
“Our work in London wasn’t as it is now.
We've made a full translation."
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the painter at the first half of the painter by shooting the ball near the bridge.
India had come into the game without any tournament winning, but it proved to be surprisingly hard opponent and retained the situation between 1 and 0 until the third period when Bam landed on the field.
Bam transported the ball long along the left side of the field, struck the middle field, hit the ball in the painting and thus brought the Americans to the 2–0 thread.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last painting in the middle of the fourth section.
The game was the first of the tournament in which American painter Jackie Briggs managed to keep the painting empty. In the first three games, the American painter had one shot in each.
Briggs now lives in his success,
as well as Bam.
"Our placement is good now," Parnham says, but how good it is, it depends on the results of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline in the midst of the Olympic hall brings zenes
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics will be inevitable.
Events, competitions and competitions in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and everywhere.
As if it were the Olympics itself, it would be a lightweight message bubble that moves from a stream shooter to a swimmer, a streamer to a streamer and a streamer triathlonistille.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a coffee zone without having to hear a dispute between Simone Biles, Katie Ledeck, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first-time Olympic Dooley smiled and could well be the name of all who would appear and belong to the best time to watch and listen, would be the favourite of sponsors and would have a good mind in TV ads if he was only a swimmer, a swordmaker or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, 28-year-old from California Lake Forest, competes with an Olympic tram.
The Olympics do not equally illuminate all competitions.
Alongside the center, there are fewer known sports in part in the shade, such as air conditioning, bulbs, football and skykwondo.
We will always have breastfeeding, and let the championship stay with us for a long time.
But if I get permission to write an unnecessary thing about my own special shares, I would like to pay attention to the trampolin attraction.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic race since the Sydney Games in 2000, its visibility has been so low in the last 16 years that many people I haven’t even known that it is an Olympic race.
Ignorance may be regional.
The U.S. has already participated athletes in the Olympics, but the country has never reached the medals and has not advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the trampolin of men, the metals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and on the side of the women are Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLennan will defend the golden players they won in London this year.
However, Trampolin has the attraction force of the supporter, partly because it sounds more suitable for a circus school than for the Olympics.
(In this context, I prove that I am not an expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species have a comedy of its potential, which has been used in the drawing films in the endless moments of the characters, but it also has the same dignity as in the reinforcement and swimming pool, i.e., species that combine essentially in the trampolin.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "skind plate".
The ambitious masters jump with a huge trampolin that sinks them to a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing, the jumpers have to make a series of acrobatic movements, such as screws, crafts and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, the hips are evaluated on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flying time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries are competing for the trampolin championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common course of the Olympics is straight forward.
The mital lines are to reach the gold in order to reach longer, faster, up and above, sometimes over the paint line, sometimes even around the field.
In addition to painting or departure, they also have another goal they strive for on television in reporting weapons, namely world or Olympic recording.
This destined goal is superior, admirable, even fanatic – and is enough even to get the viewer into the tears.
But I also think this is a bit relaxing only when looking at the cats.
This trampoline offers a relaxation rate.
In the tramway, the direction is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The builder climbs up without weight as an astronaut, falls down and climbs the pain back up.
Of course, the species also includes a competitive spectrum, and it is not easy, but it does not involve a quick breaking of paint or jumping far, but only a combination of time and gravity.
It's just as close to music as only the Olympics can get.
Women’s hottests and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and start at 13:00 local time and men’s matches on Saturday at the same time.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, starting each day at 14:00 local time.
In the midst of the Olympics, there are a quiet and wonderful moment that might remain unnoticed in the midst of the public folly.
And if consciousness can be increased only by providing attractive men's athletes and performing them - as the U.S. men's officials recently suggested in the Wall Street Journal - in this case Logan Dooley is only waiting for a remarkable new fan.
Total generation protests in Ethiopia, a long-term allied of the United States
Violence in Ethiopia
The government’s forces have scattered protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
According to the eyewitnesses, several demonstrators have been shot dead in connection with the police.
Is Ethiopia Destroying?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable Western allied whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over the past few months, the country has been treating anti-governmental protests that are increasingly spreading to the wider regions.
Just last week, thousands of people have fled into the streets demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was unpleasant.
According to the eyewitnesses, police shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
The videos described at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year show how security forces strike young people who are forced to stand on their hands against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights officer is now demanding a thorough investigation.
“The country’s unity has always been difficult, and it’s even harder to move forward,” says Rashid Abdi, Director of the International Crisis Group of the African Sarvi Project.
According to the population, Ethiopia has been the second largest country in Africa since Nigeria, whose stability has been promoted by Western countries.
The U.S. Army and Information Service are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terror threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia, and only a few African countries, if anything, receive so much assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been radically improved, the capital of Addis Abeba is even a new railroad.
The streets of the cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy, and human rights organizations have constantly reported the government's rebellion policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and the occasional thinkers are rapidly married.
Many people have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven away into the desert.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed, and they have no choice but to show their minds, they’re going out,” says Seyoum Teshome, a journalist at the University in Central Ethiopia.
“The whole young man is showing his mind.
The whole generation is protesting."
There are many subjects to disagreement, from the use of soil to the governmental coalition.
Last year, after the widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies have also gained a place that has previously belonged to the opposition, and as a result they now rule the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise at the Eritrea border, where the surpassing situation demanded hundreds of deaths during the battle in June.
Analysts are afraid that more or less devastated separatist groups, such as the Oromon Liberation and the Ogadeni People’s Liberation, may endeavor to exploit mixture and re-arms.
For the reason of the broken mood under the surface for many years, there are many reasons.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
In recent years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones have become public and Internet access has improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during the protests, many, however, access the Internet through media services that encrypt their place of residence.
Many Ethiopian young people said that this way they called people to protests.
Another reason is the rise in solidarity between the two largest population groups of Ethiopia, homogeneous, and homogeneous.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas, mostly Christians from Ethiopia, have long dominated the country’s policies and businesses and have disrupted harmonies, most of which are Muslims and live in subregions.
But this is also changing.
"Cooperation is deeper and we're getting under the same rainstorm," said Mulatu Gemechu, oromo director.
Most demonstrations have been just in oromo and amhara regions.
Many Amhars and Oromos experience that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by a tiger tribe, which only represents about 6% of the population, but still rules the army, inquiry, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the discomfort is Meles Zenawin's death.
Former rebel Meles was the Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years, until he died of an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical neron that could see behind the corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly capable of detecting the first signs of disagreement and using ambassadors that agreed between the counterparts.
“As a result, this essential instinct is missing from the current government,” said conflict investigator Abdi.
The new Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn left Meles for almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, originating in the Tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces managed by the tiger tribe.
Many are afraid of this which means more bleeding.
Last time in Ethiopia, similar noises were tested in 2005, when thousands of people seemed to demonstrate against the elections, which, according to analysts, the government first toned and then stolen.
In the post-electional disturbances, many protesters were killed, though the deaths were less than the previous months, and disturbances stopped relatively quickly.
Developing experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for remote infrastructure design, such as the new subway plant, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But from within a long time to the Ethiopian government, it has not clearly prevented the power.
And the beauty is to take a dangerous ethnic form.
In the last month, the city of Gondar, the protesters attacked tiger-owned companies, and anti-tiger hatred is increasing on social media.
According to analysts, protests are put in place by the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unemployed, neighbouring country Somalia to observe aircraft, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
While the West wants clearly to support democracy, it also does not want its unstable allies to break down.
“This requires a strict balance,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic claiming Obama to be the founder of Isis
Donald J. Trump attempted on Friday to retreat his words back in his last campaign of dispute, claiming that he had not been seriously claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the "founders" of the terrorist group of ISIS several times this week.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican president to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
It is also a challenging situation for its supporters, who must try to defend their candidate as such a storm moment and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump made the claim at the elections held on Wednesday evening and repeated in the various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said while claiming to create the President and Hillary Clinton Isis.
Early Friday morning, however, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump rounded his speech on Twitter from the last day, when he said he was in charge of several interviews quite seriously.
When radio drinker and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim, stating that Obama is trying to destroy Isis, the Republican president did not agree to resign.
The last critical storm rose when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back to the economy when the number of supports decreased.
Trump and Clinton held their economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and Clinton’s speech was desperate.
Trump has been defended with sarcasm in the past.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to hack Russians by hacking Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments saying, "Of course, I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump draws the boundaries of political speech and draws back his words if necessary.
"I believe it is his way to test certain messages that awaken the contradiction in his supporters. He looks at how supporters respond to messages, and "clearn" whether or not depending on other reactions," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who has observed the use of both of the president's language.
"But I also believe that he understands his arguments and knows that they have enough circles to pass through different fields."
Rather than Trump had softened his opinions on the election, he has made his style even more striking in recent days after his support has continued to decline.
A new study published on Friday by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Maristin said Trump’s support was significantly smaller in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorados, while the situation in Florida was strictly republican.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more accurately targeted by his presidential election campaign in the last few months, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporter in a temperate position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of Trump’s most important supporters, New York’s former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was strongly defending the president’s condition in CNN’s interview on Thursday.
"I think his words are justified as a political speech," Giuliani replied when asked if Trump was true, claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton had founded Isis.
"It is true in the mind that before Obama, Isis was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama completely wrongly called as a "later series team" and that's why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq."
Most republicans are trying to claim that Obama’s administration, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isis to continue its action when it did not handle the situation deliberately in the Middle East.
Before Friday in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of his speeches of torturing and discriminating against him.
He deceived "uncomfortable and regrettable" television commentators who are trying to make it clear, but he said they can't succeed.
Some Democrats rejected Trump’s explanation, saying it would be even more clear that he did not fit the president.
Cafe stopped opening in Greenpoint due to the rise of unfair rent
Verb Cafe was a slightly busy cafe in Williamsburg, where the payment tool was only used in cash and there was no Wi-Fi, but offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its street district at Bedford Avenue, when the rent grew up unreasonable.
In the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie was selling soaps for the Verb Cafen.
Locals consider this under the middle classroom to allege the loss of a coffee having been lost as a surprise.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is no longer, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
Although New York is no longer a former one, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just a fair kilometer north of its original location.
The new Verb cafe has Wi-Fi and there you can pay with credit cards, but some of the employees are the same and the mood is still inexpensive.
Coffee is also good.
The owner and boss of the new Verb coffee is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the old coffee.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new coffee, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things in mind.
Verb subscribes to the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso model.
In addition, it restarted even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new as well.
Add new products to the list.
There are bean-eye juice sandwiches and caprices and brown cigars available.
The list also has dark keys.
Coffee no longer gets beer, but instead juice made of fresh fruits.
After nine months of coffee, Rodriguez says that old standard customers have noticed to start visiting Verb as a uniform current.
"Most of our old customers have been priced out of Williamsburg as well," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the café last Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he walked to Verbi in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he tells him that he's stopped coffee for a while.
“I felt like Verb’s coffee and culture,” he said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on Sunday, she took her regular ice coffee instead of a chai tea, which is also a listing list.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He always went to the café before work and ordered the same without exception.
"I slept in a coffee shop every day over seven guards like a machine, and there they have already prepared my potbags with all the fullnesses," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his food.
Today, Rosenthal still stands for its standard product, but at the same time, it sometimes varies with pecon, eggs, and cheeses.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a good chance that the soap shop takes the old place.
Soap Cherien owners even offered to make a special soap, which is used for the manufacture of Verb's own cold-coated coffee.
"We can still be taken to offer," Rodriguez says.
Polish residents in Greenpoint traditionally have also received coffee with joy.
One of the new customers turned foodstuffs into Poland, and Rodriguez now tells him to seek a suitable place to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
The new place has also brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell a coffee-free coffee.
The cafe can also be expanded to the nearby building.
However, it is enough for many customers to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a standard client in Williamsburg, and he tells his heart that he was crushed when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like it had come home, says Whitt.
"I've got the smell of coffee."
A Square Meal: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after he became president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at lunch in his office room in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as a culinary, preferred luxurious foods for Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as herbs and Maryland’s kidney chest.
On that day, his food list was more demanding: devil eggs (deviled eggs) in a tomato cabin, butterflies, and after-food from the potatoes.
“It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity to people suffering,” said Jane Ziegelman.
His husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
The pair of Brooklyn Heights works as a food historian.
Coe's last book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's last book, named 97 Orchard, tells the story of a floor floor in the Lower East Side town.
Their new joint work is Harper’s book and published on Tuesday, A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food as a large lamb of the 1930s.
The couple demonstrated their own culinary solidarity as a meeting place with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron cloud shower and opened in the same year as a large stock exchange rate occurred in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream and olive sandwich and a 57-year-old Coe in return for calves, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat potato, the couple said it was suitable for a discussion on eating a very large period of time.
“The designs were very popular,” says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate the soil of the earth, the liver, and the beef of the potatoes.
They were made of materials that were cheap and adequate.
Imagine your cancer so many soaps that they’re enough for the whole meal.”
Andrew Coe is confusing.
“I had to push my stomach like a lyric,” he says.
Before the large lambs, the American dining table, especially on the rural, operates the buffet principle "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for the farmers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served with counterfeit bars.
The Americans had sent food to Europeans who were hungry during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronicle of ways that the people survived when they were forced to resign.
"This was the time when food became a central and anxious topic for Americans," Coe says and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
One anxiety was a new affordable diet: according to Ziegelman, delicate foods such as mosquitoes and battery came to the main food, and battery was called "a wonderful way to make use of stars" because cooks couldn't cover so attractive products with a cream bottle.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
The muscle, which has been the main part of American meal for years, has become a saving luxury used.
Strange mixtures were tested, where the main was filling calories and nutritional values, and not a healthy taste or even a healthy kitchen.
In doing research for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared nuts filled with nuts used as snake-free foods.
"It didn't get popular at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman added: “It was unreal.
The earthquake and the unobstruck are not matched at all.
This was characterized by many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, managed citizens' food practices in an unprecedented and unique manner.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be budgeters and to respond to the challenge to make porkkana-kermaspaget potatoes like delicious foods.
The book A Square Meal is a celebration of historical bedrooms.
Especially delicious are the explanations of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as the position of President Herbert Hoover "Let me eat cake".
While he publicly praised his childhood simple food in an iocal farm, he himself ate as a millionaire and a fine master who had become him.
"He loved continental European cuisine, such as fish and necklace," Coe says.
"He had eaten nearly in a golden-coated dining room, and had smoke on it.
He was totally excited about reality.”
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleanor had encouraged him to show him an example in his stomach.
As stated in the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economist who was not interested in the taste, the foods offered in the White House were not only Washington’s boringest, but also the worst made.”
Many of the lame-time foods were rejected as soon as the land came back to its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, continuation of the tradition continues to be seen in how we pay attention to calories and their diets and how science has been applied to food cook.
When writing, the couple tells her to better understand Ziegelman’s mother’s food habits, for example why she couldn’t throw away food.
“He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown out,” Coe says.
"People even started to get worse from their foods," Ziegelman remembers.
For example, one of the windmills.
When the headquarters had been emptyed at the Eisenberg lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe introduced their home-made black print, the same as President Roosevelt ate for his lunch.
"It's called a sweater," Ziegelman says, and adds that giving the name to unrequired recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream flour, only snow, a little butter, sugar, water and canel.
We've had our skins in the same manner as a thick brown past.
Surprisingly, it doesn’t taste bad.
Coe sents you a second and a third time.
"The Saxons would make this better," Coe says to her wife, sounding positive from a budget manager.
Full compensation for Gilead for awards of lawmakers for patenting the C-hepatitis drug with Merck
The U.S. District Court judged that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to obtain full compensation for the awards of lawmakers incurred by it for the lawmaker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for $200 million of damages for breach of two Merck’s patents in relation to success drugs named Sovaldi and Harvoni.
In a file filed on Thursday, the judge of the U.S. District Court Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead had been entitled to be exempted from the awards of lawyer resulting from the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with new generation C-hepatitis drugs that can be treated by the rich 90% of C-hepatitis patients.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other and demanded the private property rights of sophosbuvir under laboratory work. Sophosbuvir is the active substance of Gilead medicines.
U.S.-supported forces have resigned from the city of Manbij
U.S.-supported troops have been in possession of the city of Manjib near the Turkish border when the last extreme organization of Isis fighters left the city, the official said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group has now sought the city to find the last ISIS players hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, told Reuters that the kidnapping of 2,000 ISIS fighters was released.
“The city is now entirely in our possession, but we are still carrying out search operations,” Darwish said.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of federal tax
Democratic President Hillary Clinton announced on Friday his 2015 taxation, showing that his and her husband’s income was at the time $10.75 million and the real federal tax percentage of 34.2.
In 2015, Clinton donated a million dollars to charity organizations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton realised nearly $5.3 million in speech awards, and Hillary Clinton, who had previously served as Foreign Minister, announced that she earned $3 million in Simon & Schuster’s outstanding book, which understood her book.
Clinton’s Vice-President, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton have published 10-year tax statements.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine still look like a model for economic transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind the protests and revokes his promises to publish his tax information.
The U.S. presidential doctors have always disclosed their tax information, although the law does not require it.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have betrayed the tax administration and said it was the reason why Trump did not disclose his revenue information.
“The transfer is yours,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the tax details of the Democratic Party.
Trump’s Special Court Assistant Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose his tax information before the checks were finished.
Trump’s critics, including Republican President Mitt Romney and other Republican members of 2012, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his assistance to charity, his business relations, and many other connections to which Russia also reads.
Clinton has been arrested on this issue and on Friday published online a video showing the Republicans in a visible position who are suffering Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton highlighted the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every president has done for decades, and not public taxation," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or only paid a little from the two 1990s, and the New York Times’s business columnist cited on Friday several tax agents and accountants that the situation could still be similar.
The federal tax rates have risen as a key issue of presidential elections.
Clinton, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffet, has supported a rule that would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at Clinton’s election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, headquarters of Berkshire’s Hathaway Monail Camp in the same place, challenged Trump’s meeting, where they both would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says he has also been subject to the tax administration’s audit and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign has always published tax statements until 2007.
The Clintons, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, payed an average of 32 percent real federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate was about 40.5 percent.
According to the 2015 Clinton Tax Declaration, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income had wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, and Clinton reported the amount of share and interest revenue of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled turkey conditions in support of the protection of nozzles in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania have invented an unusual way to keep noises off close to the human habitat – the noises are stirred by throwing condoms filled with chili powder towards them.
Keino has proven to be effective, and the idea invented a few years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching volunteers in North Tanzania villages how people can protect their homes and farmers without harm.
A few days ago, it was used to make the sharks of the arrows.
Friday is the world’s Christmas Day dedicated to animal protection.
“We have seen the attitudes changing in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they are able to keep the bowls away without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the invasive nozzle is disturbed by showing the pocket and playing a torpedo.
If this does not work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The mixed chili powder is placed in condoms together with a squeeze, after which the head of the condom is rotated in such a way that only the filling thread remains outside.
When the filling thread is stirred, the condom explodes openly and spreads to the air a fine chili dust cloud.
Usually one taste cloud is enough to drive the nose away.
The last way is to shoot a candle known as a Roman candle in the air and bring about a rough and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticized Berlin hotel for removing the Israeli orientation number from the Arab "request" – RT News
When a French, rooted Jewish film director was revealed that Berlin’s Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel’s target number on its landmark list. The hotel’s employees were attracted by asking Arab customers to come to "the threats".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on Holocaust, dismissed his failure to address Berlin Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
Recently visiting Lanzmann tried to find the hotel in the list of destinations in Israel.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it would not exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the recipient's response to shocking him.
The recipient said that the removal of Israel from the list was "the more carefully considered decision of the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the action was shocked by the filmmaker.
According to Lanzman, the official said, "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they require the removal of the direction number of Israel."
The interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the case was "a great shame".
“The case is tired and shocking us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
There is no need for more explanations.
We are waiting for the hotel to make the right conclusions,” said the ambassador.
The case caused a pretty counter-reaction online where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski’s hotel simply denied the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Hävetje" was said in a publication showing the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes the hotel’s accusations quickly, calling it a failure and apologizing to Lanzmann.
"There has never been a direct order to leave Israel out of the direction number list," said Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski's hotel representative.
It adds that the direction number has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber products to demonstrate Brazilian students
Students joined the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government’s public education system.
Police used tears and rubber products against protesters.
The localization began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student team, as a result of which the police used rubber products and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the program that wanted to show their turmoil to government plans.
Governor Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paulo has proposed a savings measure to close nearly one hundred public schools and to invest 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the demonstrators made graffiti on the walls, with temporary opposition to the President's office of Michel Temeri.
The demonstration of the students took place only a few days after the streets were filled with separated President Dilma Rousseffi's profitable demonstrators in the vote of the Senate on this official statement.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has risen by 70,9 percent, Russian Iranian ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan said.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
“Russian companies continue their existing relations with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Increasing trade is, of course, one of the main objectives of cooperation between countries,” says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to 856 million dollars.
"In particular, Russia's exports to Iran grew rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The sale of machines, land vehicles and weapons was accelerated,” said Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects the number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry in Iran issued Iranian citizens about 35,000 visa, most of which were travel visa.
In addition, Iran was one of the first 20 countries to travel by its citizens in Russia for the first time.
And it’s not too confident to say that the number of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia will break this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small and the ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scotch Callum Skinner Painted in the British Winning Bike Gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner hit the famous men's team print on the Rion velodrom yesterday when the UK three defended the 2012 championship in London.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner played an anchor in the role he inherited from the Scottish landlord Sir Chris Hoy, who made the legend proud to thank the painting and to win as a predecessor of New Zealand’s team.
Britain won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won the fifth at his sixth Olympics.
And they repeated the temptations after they had been located only in the sixth March in the London World Championships, despite the fact that Hoy had then left his competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who was the first attractor.
The price came at the right time.
Hoy's decision to terminate the competition also left a hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom British coaches believed and where they saw the potential he had now rescued.
Hindes, with Hoyn, who won the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made the Olympic recording over time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the UK's three wins gold in the double battle.
Hindes was definitely behind after his turn, but Kenny tried to take the team to the lead position that Skinner kept.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy so that Hindes drives the speed to calm down at a larger range, which enabled Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep the speed.
Hoy followed the BBC’s commentator and targeted Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they came to the award.
Glasgow’s 23-year-old Skinner says: “I’m overwhelmed by breastfeeding.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We played the Olympics at the final and won the world championships.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoyn, confessed that they had fallen on the track for a bad ride.
Later, he rejected his words and had no choice for British competitors.
This time there were no such problems with the victory of sovereignty.
"The reputation was like in London, all British tickets are flying in their eyes.
Our team has been united in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships that the win in the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one competition, one golden toll for the country, who won seven ten rail championships both in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress in the last five months, there are five successful days in front of the velodrom.
As Kenny has been able to demonstrate, it is impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three gold in one Olympics.
This would mean that the account was awarded six gold metals and one silver metal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta, and was born on March 23 (the mysterious date of British sport, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
At times, meditations would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny will compete in the next sprint, which begins today and will be solved in three days.
Kenny, a 28-year-old Bolton, says: “I can only enjoy this at the moment.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the win with your friends.
Winning alone is a bit lonely.”
The price says, "If he wins two more gold talents, he must have the value of the rider."
This was the only medal competition for the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest four teammates.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The World Record, which was held in London in 2012 and won gold, was 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) are competing today on the second competition day, and the focus of attention is definitely Wiggins.
Yesterday he had a dispute with the competitors before the time when the suppliers invited him to measure his length.
In the corresponding women's competition that will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world recording time 4:13.260.
The UK team can now be confident that its great rail bike team will take responsibility for the mid-Olympics and bring a number of miles to the country.
After the truly exceptional displays received from the full lead station in Beijing and London, expectations before Rioa have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, of which little is the resignation of technical manager Shane Suton in April, amongst allegations about sexism and misleading, and the ending of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton’s competitions.
However, the competitions held at Velodroms in the first evening show that the legendary reputation of Britain to rise to the top at the perfect moment will take place once again.
The future of Portland's bankruptcy on the horizon due to the end of the electricity agreement
The future of the aluminum layer in Portland, Victoria, and hence the jobs of thousands of employees are on the horizon, when the power company that delivers electricity to layer said that one of the factory owners is breaking down the delivery agreement and that all delivery agreements are expected to be terminated.
This is the consequence of the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year without continuing the aid to which the factory is being held in operation.
Fixed, 20 years of support will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland factory is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
As a result of cessation, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be in danger.
The snowball impact can continue to increase, as it consumes approximately 10% of Victoria's entire electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's lockdown, as a result of which, the Anglese power plant was forced to be closed last year.
Alcoan Portland's lockdown loses money and is at risk of having to close his door.
The measures are responsible for the factory's speculations used for years in the future, which were first caused by the strong Australian dollar and the recent factory production price.
AGL, which delivers electricity to a large aluminum bulb from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says expecting three other bulb owners to terminate their agreement as well.
As a majority owner of the factory, Alcoa and Alumina are a joint venture formed by the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
AGL says it is expected that the Portland production facility continues to operate, which means that the physical demand for electricity will continue.
AGL reports that the so-called protection agreements had to enter into force in November 2016.
The withdrawal period of the contracts is 12 months, so they expire in 2017.
"So, AGL expects contract-generating revenue for the financial year 2017," the power plant says.
Possible yields for AGL from 2018 are currently limited by the strong future market prospects for wholesale prices of electricity.
AGL already says it has reduced the value of the contracts in its accounting by $187 million "as an anticipation for the withdrawal of the contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision on the cessation of the contracts "does not affect the Alcoa ... capacity to keep a shutdown in operation or to ensure electricity supply to shutdown".
The American company said it had concluded a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which had to enter into force since November this year, although it still has to find out why it has now resigned from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the area, the analysts have been careful for their assessments both of the swelling station in the Victorian state of Portland and of the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
AGL’s operating director Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts in a previous week’s speech that Portland uses approximately 600 megawatts of electricity and approximately 900 megawatts of Tomago at the annual level.
“If these factories leave the market, it means a significant decline in demand in the electricity market.
As a producer, it wouldn’t be good news,” says Mikkelsen.
Kardashianit TV star Kendall in September as Vogue Wallpaper Girl
The Kardashian-Jenner clan’s model and the fourth daughter of Kris’s mother and manager Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous US Vogue September number.
Kendall, an advertisement member of Estee Lauder, who appeared in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Instagram account Thursday.
“Looking at the room that was full of my loved ones made me tears,” Kendall wrote.
The publishing of the album was followed by a strange (or perhaps just following the Kardashian series style?), a scripted video in which all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (the bars of Rob and Caitlyn and all the favorites, the filmmaker of the Kardashian program, Ryan Seacrest, was forgotten by his sister in her head.
My drink is clinic, and it is used for almost all the birthday periods of the aesthetic programs (Seacrest says, "Do you think we forgot you?" as honestly as the child's morning TV drawer shah), but Krisin had to make the other daughters public in some way according to this.
The introduction of Vogue in September means a controversial new Kardashian era.
Kendall's grandfather Kim may have posted Vogue's complaint before (he appeared in the footer of Vogue along with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the number of September magazines is entirely in its own category.
The number of September is the most sold publication of Vogue in the year.
Its thickness of a larger image book than the fashion magazine is attracting a large number of advertisers (the Fashion site declined that last year’s 832 page tutorial had 615 pages of advertisements).
The publication of the National Star in September is expected so intensely that the pictures of the newspaper have been published in the past two years before its official announcement.
Earlier in September, they have been photographed by Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been reputations that have been doing the model's work before, rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior advertising plant Jennifer Lawrence was in a portrait in 2013, and a year later she was honored by Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner's generation's success model, and even though he would read him among the famous ones who worked with the model before, he is pretty good with him.
These celebrities are not known people's relatives, real TV stars, or modern children who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can reasonably be called gifted women who will succeed in the entertainment industry above others.
Last year, Beyonce has one of the strongest years in her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Due to his real television background, Jenner’s role in the fashion world will always be stubborn.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Stephanie Seymour, valued Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them “natures”.
These feelings have been rediscovered when the news of Jenner’s presence in Voguen became public.
However, the ongoing dissatisfaction is unnecessary.
Kendall Jenner is Vogue's September number folder model.
He is a supermodel in the most pure meaning of the word.
He walks at Marc Jacob's fashion shows.
He's an advertisement for Estee Lauder.
She and all her sister sell images of themselves through payable applications.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed to the LOVE magazine.
And in his leisure time, he appears on real TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centers displace 160,000 people per year
Each year, more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable countries are displaced from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impacts that additional appropriations will already have to cut for the centres operating at the borders.
In the Queensland state, legal assistance and lawsuits are deferred from five persons, most of whom are elderly, immigrants, poor workers, victims of violence and unreasonable marriages, and similar injustice against people fighting without resources.
Public legal assistance services whose workload is already overloaded are preparing for additional appropriations.
As of June, legal aid centres are at risk of losing more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Legal Aid Center, says that thousands of people are being displaced from the centres every year, according to the latest accounting report prepared by the National Legal Aid Centres.
If the federal government does not rotate its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly under-financing, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the necessary services they need when they apply for," Farrell said.
“People who leave the violent relationships, people under the ungovernmental and defective debts, families, unreasonably dismissed workers – all of them have problems with legal affairs, and this report shows that they are unable to get their needs of help.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland’s weakest position will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to give up immediately from these financial incidents so that people can receive legal assistance they need.
Last year, the State administration fulfilled its promise of bringing legal aid to the national central level.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their customers, and the Palaszczu government must invest in this important work.”
Trump’s campaign against Donald Trump raises a threat to employees by gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was raised when no action was supposed to be taken after it was told to lead that the leader of North Carolina had threatened employees with their weaponry on their journey in Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint by former state campaign software coach Vincent Bordini on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said for months that the situation would be treated internally before he realized, according to his own words, that this would not happen.
Bordini said in his complaint that campaign manager Earl Phillip "shows the piston, puts the right finger on the move and pushes the pipe on Vincent's knees."
According to the complaint, the campaign for local and regional leadership Bordini heard that at least four other people had experienced the same Phillip.
"Although the gun wouldn't be thrown out, it would cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican President of the Republicans caused general anger by saying to the crowd in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second extra colony" – including armed owners and armed officers – can take action if his counterpart Hillary Clinton wins the voter and receives the voter.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his words from their context and Trump did not encourage violence.
Bordini claims a compensation from the campaign due to independence and Phillip’s compensation for the crash, regret, and mental suffering caused by them.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to a message that asked him to comment.
Phillip wasn't met despite the attempts.
Charlotte’s local news agency WCCB told Phillip that he recently left a campaign.
Phillip’s consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, did not receive an immediate response to the call request submitted.
President Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.
Court case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain has to use the Olympic soul to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also restores the economy and creates well-being – not only in local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
As at the 2012 Olympics in London, this was the most interesting thing for me, and as we greatly emphasized that all of our nation and all of our regions would benefit from them.
The Olympics had a huge benefit for Stratford and East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only for local communities we create 10,000 new learning contracts and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the nearby airport areas.
Like at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who believe Heathrow’s expansion is a too big challenge.
With regard to the Olympics, I heard that Britain should never be ready for them and that we will be in a tempting situation in the eyes of the other world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Heathrow as well.
The winning barriers are always facing, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits fewer than many.
The enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and to increase the economy of 211 billion pounds, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport’s environment and to the UK.
We have a great working group at Heathrow, which has implemented in its time and has been in the budget of a 11 billion pounds infrastructure investment programme, which includes the T5 terminal – which has been voted as the best flight terminals of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which has been built in the middle of the world’s two most cruel routes.
Now they are ready to produce a third gratitude with a support for a private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success in our country, and I am convinced that it will also be Heathrow’s expansion.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic soul for Heathrow's expansion to guarantee our future trading and to create knowledge and employment that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of Heathrow’s government and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising Service Cat Mouse Play
The efforts of businesses earning money from online advertising has turned into a cat-mouse-player, a block-producing company says.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it blocked advertising programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it said users could update their blocking software filters and thus again block community ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change ad codes on its desktop site so that ad programs would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are ads.
Now Adblock tells us that he has discovered new codes.
Adblock’s publisher Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that “this kind of fireworks between the open-source advertising community and fraudulent advertisers has been in operation since the advertisement was invented” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the struggle is a strong evidence of how much concern advertisers have formed in the industry.
According to Pagefair and Adobe’s research last year, 200 million people worldwide are estimated to be using advertising programs.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users daily on mobile devices, and the share of mobile advertising is already 84% of Facebook advertisements.
However, the company intends to bet on advertising programs on its desktop application as mobile blocking programs are not working on Facebook and Instagram.
The revenue from desktop ads remains large enough, so Facebook considered the effort to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it was updating the user settings advertising tool so that users can control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters as it also prevents the display of some ordinary Facebook posts.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we're going to solve the problem," the Facebook newsletter said in a statement.
"The art test programs are incredible and inefficient, and therefore we have contributed to the development of advertising tools such as user settings so that people can control the targeting of advertisements themselves."
A woman committed suicide by leaving the cars under the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police ask for the help of eyewitnesses on the motorway on Thursday in the first hours of an accident in which a woman was deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway at the Vaud’s canton near Morgesia shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate acts as she lay on a dark road, and she hit more cars, said Vaud’s police officer.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his effort was clearly to commit suicide, including a truck among overtime cars.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. Police asks them or other witnesses of the accident to sign up.
Attorney Gilles Hofstetter in Le Tribune de Geneve reports that the criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical stage in such a situation.
However, it will be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in an accident will be raised.
“Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains to be solved by the prosecutor,” said Hofstetter.
During the past five years, two similar cases have occurred in which drivers are not considered responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, a person walked on a dark highway, and the law decided that the drivers could not expect to meet their pedestrians in the middle of the night.
Last year, the Police Authority was released from the accusation that had been raised against him by the death penalty when he met a man who was sitting on the A1 highway near Paynerne on one night in August 2014.
The court heard that a 22-year-old victim had enjoyed a lot of alcohol and shots on the road.
The Court concluded that the police – which was corresponding to the emergency call – driving was justified and a man sleeping on the road was “a totally exceptional and unpredictable situation”.
On Thursday, some people are asked to call the police to 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus has been living
According to NASA’s new climate system, Venus may have been living.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that enables Venus to explore the past with the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes be similar to the earth, although Venus is warm and waterless on the surface and its gas body consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous researchers, the slow rotating speed of Venus is explained by its thick gas sugar.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Russia has had a thin atmosphere that corresponds to the earth, and despite this, it has slowly rotated.
The model was also used to investigate the early Venus surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid destruction.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% more shiny.
"In GISS's modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daylight is almost two months at the same time," says GISS's researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a rainstorm and protects the surface from a large amount of solar heat.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model created the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planet researchers on its development costs.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet oil for several billions of years.
Its oceans collapsed, and ultraviolettalo burned the vaporized water.
In the water’s karate into space, only a thick carbon dioxide gas and a murderous greenhouse effect — Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of a new Venus air conditioning study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves his place as Avalanchen coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and follows as Vice-President of the Ice Cream to the lack of impact opportunities for the team in decision-making.
Colorado’s Deputy Chief Executive Officer Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the company will immediately start seeking a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have managed my task as the head coach of Colorado Avalanche team, and I have monitored my deputy Chief Executive Officer for the Ice Cream," said Roy, a 50-year-old.
“During the summer, I’ve been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed, and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Deputy Chairman of the Coach and Monitoring Ice Cream Operations must be completely the same as the organization.
He must also have power in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his efforts to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we hope for everything for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League of the Year for his first season as the head coach of Avalanchen 2013-2014.
Under his leadership, the group reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost Minnesota in falling games and has not reached the continuation period for the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39-39-4 matches in the 2015-2016 season and remained five-points at Minnesota Wild when playing a second Wild Card site at a western conference.
The Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups – two on the Montreal Canadian lines and two on the Avalanchen lines.
North Sea oilkeepers start negotiations and suspend law
The main negotiators inform the interruption of the oil wages of the North Sea when all parties participate in the new negotiation cycle.
The Wood Group, which offers oil field services, has been held in the North Sea by boring cargos under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreements to restart the process in order to resolve the disputes."
From the beginning of the next week, we will attend several lasting meetings throughout the day for the next few weeks, addressing the problems of fresh aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which were the first in more than 25 years, as a protest for salary cuts of up to 30% possible.
Due to negative market pressures, the Wood Group will cut approximately 9 percent of the tariffs of its carriers operating in the North Sea this year.
The company’s tariffs will be reduced by 10 per cent in 2011 to the prices of workers working in the countries.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the mobility rate necessary to survive the decline in the market.
Shell, in turn, has hired thousands of employees and announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, which aims to increase its functions after megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
The lower prices of raw oil and the economic situation, resulting from the decision of the UK to leave the European Union in June, create pressure on energy companies.
Scottish parliamentary Dave Anderson met workers earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest workouts that have been experienced in the North Sea for the entire generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need a economy that has an advantage for many and not only for few,” Anderson says.
It is expected to spend less than $1.4 billion on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, with about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleadia
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope was to measure the rotational speed of the stars, which has helped astronomers to gather the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of the stars belonging to the Plejade Star.
Based on new data, astronomers are able to figure out why the stars belonging to the same stars are rotating at different speeds and how touring times are related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other star teams, we learn more about the relationship between the weight and age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the Caltech University’s infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena.
The Pleadian star team is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, meaning they are just reaching their adult age.
They’re rotating faster than ever.
With the speed of rotation at the top of the adult stars, large amounts of stars break out.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars in their advanced magnetic signs.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the detectable stars (which corresponds to the sun) appearing.
The latest listed rotational speed data indicate that larger stars rotate slower than lower.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – larger wheels run slower than smaller.
"We see the Pleadian "dance" that slowly the wheels are typically bigger, while the fastest wheels are typically very light stars," Rebull says.
Since the Plejadian star team is so close, it functions as an ideal space laboratory to compare the characteristics of the stars in relation to rotational speeds.
"The Plejadi Stars team provides support pillars for theoretical models that address the rotation of younger and older stars," Rebull says.
We want to get more information about how, when and why the stars slow their rotational speed and stop "dance".
Rebull presents his colleagues with the latest analysis of the rotational speeds of Pleadia in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
