Quick increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) within the European Union/the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The accumulated impact of coronavirus cases (COVID-19) shows similar developments in the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Area and the UK, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a high level of COVID-19 patients who need intensive care, and in particular for intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an unknown case of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a benevolent condition, i.e. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In approximately 14% of the cases, COVID-19 causes more severe injury that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop a severe form of disease that requires intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
As part of this study, we evaluate the evolution of the accumulated impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with the evolution experienced by the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Covid-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that of the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020 of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO definition of case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 with people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in each of the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (UK) with, between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only for Italy.
Obtaining the accumulated number and the accumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CEPCM), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country worldwide, only obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities of different countries and the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data have been used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 within the EU/EEA and the UK, and to establish a comparison with Italy’s experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative impact of COVID-19 cases for 14 days, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and the UK, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the accumulated number of cases reported in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolve of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The development of the accumulated 14-day COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the accumulated impact of COVID-19 began to grow around February 21 before seeing a drastic increase around February 28, 2020 (plus data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK had a similar increase in the accumulated impact of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 presents the accumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
On 15 March at 8:00 p.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results show that the number of cases reported of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
The evolution of the cumulative impact of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic progresses at a comparable speed in all countries.
And this despite the fact that countries are at different stages and there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, as well as differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including for rattrapage tests.
Earlier March 2020, doctors in the affected regions in Italy indicated that about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that intensive hospitals and care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available across the EU/EEA for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not presented data).
However, a systematic collection is required to complete the current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds for 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios relating to saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with a risk &gt; 90 % of overflow of intensive care capacities, are provided in the sixth update of the relative CEC-risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since cases have previously been grouped in some regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care services usually host a defined regional population, UNU cases and intensive care beds data (2) should preferably be established at level 2 of the Nomenclature.
The current experience of Italy and the development in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing within the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a community-supported SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who need intensive care, and in particular, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized by the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPCM, a rapid, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, from an end-up approach to a mitigation approach, to the extent that the rapid and early improvement of the number of cases could not be realized in response,and could not allow enough time for decision-makers and
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window where each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health services.
Without what, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have to face a peak of patients who need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing humanitarian disaster.
As its homologus, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of cases of SRAS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by swallows and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SRAS, but it is much more transmissible, and it affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article is endeavoring to provide a timely and thorough review of this subject in full growth.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this examination will participate in a better understanding and elimination of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, January 25, 2020, marked forever the Chinese, who seemed to be forced to remain clothed for the entire gold week as well as for long other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologated to the coronavirus (CoV) which causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic (SRAS) in 2003; therefore it was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and quickly spread across China before expanding to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is the “public enemy number 1”, which is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020 with multiple virus, isolation sequence.
This examination attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this new subject in full growth.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SRAS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that took place in 2012).
We will also focus on what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prediction of the disease, and we will address some issues still in suspense but still urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common heats.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
Today’s COVID-19 is the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As shown in Fig.1,1, then unknown pneumonia homes were first reported to Wuhan on December 31, 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it was reported that healthcare professionals had been infected, suggesting that interhuman transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease indicated that, in 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the starting point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO called the World Health Emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of the report, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
As the situation rapidly evolves, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentric study conducted on 8,866 patients, of which 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mostly in the range of 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50 years old, very little under 20 years old, and only 14 were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and periphery.
The average duration between the appearance of symptoms and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between the appearance of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
Base reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, which coincides with the massive moves that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (man), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses constitute a subfamily of large-grown viruses containing a simple RNA.
They can be classified into four genres, namely alfa, beta, gamma, and delta, the coronavirus known for infecting the man belonging to the alfa and beta genres.
The glycoprotein Spike (S) of the enclosure is linked to the conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then a membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released in the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genetic RNA accompanied by enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vessels containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-virus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples taken on the site of the epidemic, the sea fruits market of Huanan in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using the transmission electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory pathways.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein S is less strongly linked to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less significant infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein codified by orf3b as well as a secreted protein codified by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain known domains or functional motives.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure with a 2.9 Å resolution complex with the B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that the complex, which presented open and closed conformations, was assembled in the form of dimmer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
The B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug crashing to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It has been found that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from souris and that they were transmitted to Man via targets and camels, respectively.
Following a phylogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, saurics have been advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to both SRAS-type coronaviruses from saurics called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-X-SL-ZV.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the barrier of species to infect the Man remains unknown, and the transmission path is still clear.
Ji, and al., have issued the assumption that the virus could have been transmitted from snakes to humans by snakes, which would imply a homologated recombination within protein S.
According to a study conducted by researchers from Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-feeding mammy museum, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 if judged by 99% genetic homology done between a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARSV.
However, a 1% difference between two genes constitutes a significant difference; therefore, concluding results should be expected to be made to establish concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and 40 to 50% humidity.
The SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties very well.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays as well as at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, etanol at 75%, chloro-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally lacks SARS-CoV-2 immunity and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study of immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by its inner immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including type C lectin receptors, type Toll receptors (TLR), type NOD receptors (NLR) and type RIP receptors (NLR).
Through different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Helping T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free radicals, which can lead to serious lung injuries as well as other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisceral failure or even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a home appearance, is more likely to affect elderly people with comfort and pregnant women.
It is commonly admitted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days after a study conducted on the first 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study conducted on 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days, for a range ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded with a 4.8-day incubation period (3.0-7.2) according to a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that sanitary authorities adjust the effective duration of quarantine after the most precise possible incubation period, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Usually, people exposed to or infected by the virus are placed in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and can be accompanied by or not other symptoms such as dry cough, breathing, muscle pain, swelling, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypochemistry a week after the appearance of the disease.
With regard to serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagullopathie.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiography abnormalities, should be tested for the virus in order to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnea and 33% diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilator assistance.
Similar findings have been reported by two recent studies conducted on a family and a home appeared following the transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% needed ventilation assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a higher mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
With regard to SRAS, it was found that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%), and that ventilation assistance was needed for about 14-20% of patients.
On February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, for 66,576 confirmed worldwide cases.
Compared, SRAS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8 096 confirmed cases.
According to the MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, the mortality was 37 per cent for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 reached 6.47 with a trust interval (IC) of 95 % from 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only from 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is shown in Table1.1.
The data above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less letal.
Therefore, it is much harder to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or within a assembly or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or lived in Wuhan or in other affected regions, or were in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks prior to the appearance of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks and that recovered patients can be carriers of the virus again, highlighting the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells &lt; 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes &lt; 1 × 109/L, as well as a high level of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia were identified in 1 099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients experienced high levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most experienced an increase in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most severe cases, the D-diarrhoea, a degradation product of fibrine present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually declined.
In most patients with COVID-19, abnormalities in the throat are observed, characterized by bilateral inequality shadows or depolished glass opacity at the lung level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung lesion and acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchanges.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in the surfactant rate and an increase in surface voltage, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to sweat and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest exams often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte decaining, hyalin membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the presence of multinuclear syncytic cells in the lungs of a disease-deceased patient, which coincides with the pathology of viral and SDRA infection S and patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a chain reaction by polymerase after reverse transcription (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of fake negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was then no longer based on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SRAS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological exams is essential and essential to establish an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technology based on the CRISPR technology for SARS-CoV-2 detection purposes, which enables the identification of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 ARN fragments without equipment requires 20 × 10-18 mol/L'ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens would be conclusive.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can only provide support for COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of treatments that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, recovered patients plasma, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmaceutical companies all use to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects lungs first and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory insufficiency constitute the main threat to patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; it includes general oxygen therapy, high-speed oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified heart pulmon derivation technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory impairment.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as protecting vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It has been found that an excessive reaction to the immune system leads to cytoquinic shock in patients with SRAS and MERS.
A cytochinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytoxins, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytoquinic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, were used to treat cytoquinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokin shock include immune response modulation by T cells, blocking IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytoxins, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytoxin signaling suppressor 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the severity of inflammatory injuries.
However, high-dose steroids did not have any beneficial effects on severe lung lesions in patients with SRAS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would lead to serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which thus significantly affects prediction.
Nevertheless, the careful use of short- to moderate corticosteroid cycles has been recommended for patients with severe form of COVID-19.
At the time of the drafting of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed yet.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, has proved effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Then, rem remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple RNA viruses, including MERS and SRAS.
Given these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, association with lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been developed as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver injury, as well as other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have been healed from contagious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or protecting healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
In fact, recovered patients often have a relatively high antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Thus, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had been healed from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with a decrease in inflammation phenomenon, a reduction in viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are required to offer this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given therapeutic effects, certain plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytoxin release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the plasma demand for treating severely ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
MTC has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, set according to the MTC theories.
Most of the effective components remain few or unknown as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal associations.
Currently, due to the absence of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a severe form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have proved effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 were observed in Chinese provinces using MTC for 87% of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7%), the Ningxia region (50%) and the Hunan region (50%), while the Hubei province, which only used up to 30% of the patients with COVID-19 (13%), has a lower cure rate.
However, this is a rather approximate comparison because many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and its employees published a study comparing treatment using only Western medicine (MO) and combined treatment associated with MO and MTC.
It appeared that the return time to normal body temperature, the disappearance time of symptoms and the hospitalization time were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the only MO group.
Even more impressive, the symptom worsening rate (from light to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%); the mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficiency and innocence of the MTC remains to be clarified through controlled tests carried out on a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of MTC treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 usually feel serious concern about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those placed in quarantine also experience a feeling of boring, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxis and cough, as well as side effects of treatments, such as insomnia induce by corticosteroids, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early times of the SRAS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotric excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion state and even suicidal trends.
The compulsory search for contacts and quarantine, as part of the response of public health services to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and cause a certain blame for patients in relation to the effects of contamination, quarantine, and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as likely cases, individuals in contact with these populations, as well as any other in trouble.
This psychological support should include training multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid any close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal tanks and humans infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce powerful long-term neutralising antibodies and/or induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live mitigated vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for SRAS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in elderly and models subject to fatal provocation as well as their protection against zoonotic virus infection remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the SRAS has failed 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
On the contrary, sporadical cases and homes of MERS continue to be declared in the Middle East and in other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endmic areas.
Various vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using the inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus apparent particles and recombinant protein subunities, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge due to the important time (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic coronavirus variations.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 just starts its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequels.
However, like SRAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Consequently, establishing a forecast model is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies to date, factors that may affect or be associated with the prediction of COVID-19 patients are the following (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for SRAS prediction, and this also seems to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected by individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years, according to a study conducted on 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying combs and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 against 51 years), suggesting age as a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and aritmy.
Heart attacks were also the main cause of death in patients with SRAS.
It has been found that SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to positive cholangiocytes of ACE2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are highly correlate and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue lesions; it has been advanced as a potential predictive factor of disease, response to treatment and healing.
The correlation between CRP rate and severity as well as the forecast for COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also contribute to the forecasting.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, particularly at heart and liver level, and are released in case of tissue injury.
They are therefore traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic radiography results and temporary progression of clinical symptoms must be examined in conjunction with other elements for the determination of COVID-19 prognosis and complications.
Usage of steroids: as described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors in supplementary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory injuries.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used for severe cases of SRAS, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting from permanent incapacity and moderate quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, the administration of steroids to COVID-19 patients should be limited to a low dose and a short period of time.
Mental stress: as described above, the COVID-19 epidemic has led to a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often experience long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty as well as the death of relatives or other patients.
It is essential to offer psychological accompaniment and long-term support to help these individuals overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to demographic studies, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than SRAS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory pathways, SARS-CoV-2 also effectively replicates in the upper respiratory pathways and does not cause or cause symptoms in the first phase of infection, like coronaviruses originating from common heats.
Consequently, recently infected individuals or during incubation periods can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly prevents control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely sick patients, with very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than that of SRAS.
There are currently significant efforts in China, including Wuhan confinement and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing quarantine setting of almost all the population in order to interrupt the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new cases declined, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and the decline phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believes that COVID-19, which appears to be much more infectious than SRAS, will not turn out in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the samples of the middle nasal cornea and throat of recovered patients, 2 weeks after leaving the hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to the flu.
However, incentive signs were observed in China with a progressive decline in new cases, suggesting that implemented strategies would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, the Ebola virus was supposed to lead to up to a million cases and half a million deaths.
However, thanks to a quarantine laying and strict isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
As for SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infection to end up out or evolve into a less pathogenic virus that is consistent with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SRAS and MERS epidemic is provided below (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by cough or exhaustion, and also possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in seals, thus revealing a new possibility of fecuno-oral transmission.
A recent study in 138 patients found that 41% of the cases were likely due to nasocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
It is therefore necessary to take precautions to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, sick relatives and colleagues, and even anyone who is likely to be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first possible defense line to reduce the risk of infection is in the port of face masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) contributes to controlling the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposit on surfaces, where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions capable of penetrating completely; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the sized SARS-CoV, as both measure about 85 nm.
Since the particles are able to cross five surgical masks empilated on each other, it is essential that healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 masks (1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals must wear adjusted insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor found himself infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a mask N95; the virus could have penetrated his body by an inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent glasses or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations of affected regions or potentially affected regions, it is highly recommended to wash hands with desinfecting soap more often than usual, to remain limited to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is recommended to maintain a distance of a meter with the sick.
These measures are effective means of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have put China in high alert after the SRAS epidemic in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention comforted the population by claiming that the new virus was uninfected, that it had limited interhuman transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message led to a remarkable release, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain Wuhan’s disease was missed.
The Chinese disease control agencies must take lessons from them and take necessary measures.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more careful in their public ads, because each word accounts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) show more sensitivity and response to unusual clinical data rather than expecting formal reports of doctors or official bodies and more sensitive to healthcare, but rather increasing healthcare, and also more restrictive to regular healthcare and healthcare systems; (3) have more restrictive responses to the population.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of the report, it extended to China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and as the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SRAS, the COVID-19 epidemic is born as an impression of already seen.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SRAS, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women; severity and mortality rates are also more important in elderly people.
SRAS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SRAS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients; therefore it is much harder to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread much faster and much more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 ARN detection tests can be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be again positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain suspended, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SRAS-type coronavirus originating from saurics, this is not enough to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originates from chiropteres.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, e.g. the souris, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupt the transmission effectively, and the epidemic can restart at any time.
Molecular modeling and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how does the virus penetrate exactly into the respiratory cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also link to cells expressing ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a quick and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during interhuman transmission?
Will it evolve in a global pandemic, disappear like SRAS, or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to get answers to all of these questions as well as to many others.
However, no matter what expenses this should induce, we have no other choice but to put an end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only few immunodepressed patients have had a severe infection of the lower respiratory tracts.
The first case of SRAS comes back to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without counting the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could approximately generate two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the top of the viral load appearing on day 10 of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headaches, fever, discomfort and irritation, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory disorder as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, fake liver function tests and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analysis in case of SRAS suspected.
Diffused alveol lesions, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SRAS.
About 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory pathways, several organs including gastrointestinal pathways, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by a cytochin shock, which can be fatal especially in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to research on HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, elderly people and immunodepressed patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjonctivite, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal samples of a 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present worldwide.
The HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Usually, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulents or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SRAS and are characterized by an acute evolutionary pneumonia.
Unlike SRAS, many patients with MERS also developed acute kidney failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to rapid spreading around the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoV showed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other HCoV.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCoV (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like the other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in seal samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, pathogenity and sustainability after human transmission, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four Community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
In order to do so, HCoVs must repeat themselves in humans in a sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for the host's restriction factors.
In this optic, the more SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the more the number of infected people is important, the more there are chances that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it fits well, the transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four CoVs acquired in the community are circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetitive subjects.
These viruses do not require animal tanks.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic tanks and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
The SARS-CoV-2 features similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoV acquired in the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoV acquired in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among the latter without a tank or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origins of HCoV, we will be very useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, tanks, intermediaries and HCoV amplifiers.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if a nearby ascendant is home to sharing a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus is often well adapted and is not pathogenic for its host.
Similarly, a host host hosts the HCoV continuously and in the long term.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endimite.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural tank host.
In particular, since 80% of the Guangzhou market animals have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals can also be used as intermediate amplifier hosts cannot be excluded.
These souris are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundations of a new concept that the souris are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The conversion enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, it is generally estimated that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of the SARS-CoV and that the saurics are not the immediate host of the SARS-CoV.
This is why the souris can’t be the intermediate tank host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that drugs were seropositive to specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory pathways, but also through fecal pathways, which is also the main pathway for excretion of the soups.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that which separates the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 of pangolin.
Recombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be derived from cow-sous CoV, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in robbers.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another cow-sous CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelides were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species' barrier to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the interspecies transmission of the HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-near souris has been found.
First of all, unlike the alpags, men can have a contact with the sharks in a shared ecological niche.
On the contrary, humans have close contacts with the alpags.
Then, the alpha-CoV of the cowboy apparent to HCoV-229E are numerous and non-patogenic in the cowboys, while the alpha-CoV of the cowboy has caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in wild animals.
In fact, sauries are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including anger virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that the souris can transmit HCoV-229E directly to man.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV of the cowboy serves as a genetic container of HCoV-229E, alphas and drugs could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, precisely as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-speed transmission of cruises to dromagers and dromagers to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in the saurics is known for its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in drugs for decades.
It fits well with these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural tank hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities of inter-species of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the souris can be the host of a SARS-CoV-2 virus nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with the sows through the washing or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SRAS-CoV-2-related virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus by cleaning and consuming cattle meat.
Many mammals, including pets, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been both in contact with saurics and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is underway.
Compared to other single-way RNA viruses, estimated CV mutation rates could be considered as "moderated" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutions per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CV to new hosts.
However, CoV mutations are approximately one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to dromagers.
In theory, genetic derivatives are unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Thirdly, CoVs randomly and frequently change models when replicating the ARN thanks to a unique “copy choice” mechanism.
The phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found both for HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors listed above, the viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor that influences inter- species transmission.
The SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during the inter-species transmission episodes.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein S unit S means that the binding affinity of this protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomicroscopic study indicates an affinity 10-20 times higher than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receiver may be required for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with a different portion of protein S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and silic acid 9-O-acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and HCoV natural tank hosts, such as sauries, dromaders and roughers, could constitute a barrier to inter-species transmission.
The emergence of new HCoV: return to the start box
The diversity of cow cow cows offers many opportunities for the emergence of new cows.
In this sense, cow-sous CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the SARS-CoV supplementary proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, since the SARS-CoV-related cow-surge viruses were isolated, but encoding divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is printed as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10 and in some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic has experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated cabbage and camel viruses, the alfa-CoV of the alpaga has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a delay of the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when covs were infected with covs, indicating mutual adaptation between covs and covs.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in activation of pro-inflammatory response in coughs effectively reduce the pathology caused by CoVs.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the hairs could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and cause new pathogenic viral roots when they are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic CoV roots could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
This is not a chance if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogeneous or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts tanks such as saurics and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are essentially due to hyperactivation of immune response and cytochin shock; the stronger the immune response, the severer the lung lesions.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decomposed from the replication of CoV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 is defective in the swallows.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a 95 % nucleotidic homeology sharing beta-CoV with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a 96 % nucleotidic homeology sharing beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV was discovered remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs were returned under the flames of the ramp due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as it was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the cow-souris CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until an opportunity of contamination occurs.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose tanks.
First, if the souris transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances the souris and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the laughter plays a more direct role in the transmission to man, it is necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the laughter.
Thirdly, if a third mammy plays the role of true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sauries and pangolins.
Whether it is a saury, a pangolin or another mammals, we should identify SARS-CoV-2 or nearly identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by forgetting to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucus).
The main medical objective of the washing of hands is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause diseases.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of child mortality rates in childbirths at home.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which accounts for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die every year.
Handwashing also protects from impotence, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deterrent effect, frequent washing of hands can break the skin by causing skin drying.
A Danish 2012 study revealed that excessive hands-washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands, characterized by squameous skin and diarrhoea, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent washing of hands is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsory obsessional disorder (TOC).
The deparasite twice a year, associated with daily wash of hands with soap and teeth brushing with fluored toothbrush, is the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and dishwashers is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin because the lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can close bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or desinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant stems are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, these may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having a common antimicrobial function, and other common health agents were effective as well as the common health agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthole, and plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria increase much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, soft and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of soft water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for the hands is a product of non-aquatic hands hygiene.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thick agent such as carbonate (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizing agent such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or mould for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for the hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate the germs.
Hydroalcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcohol solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcohol solution must be used to either wet or cover both hands.
Increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequately washing hands unless you have water and soap in your hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcohol solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsionants and/or hydrating agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emulents to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients have caused much less irritation and skin dryness than soaps or antimicrobial waste agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aquatic products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand desinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogenic agents, as these remain on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands desinfectants is strongly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based desinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Cinderella or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or cedar is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking it.
Like soap, cedar is also a desinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wash your hands with tears or cold water.
The common water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap mowing on your hands by frosting them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frot for at least 20 seconds.
The flutter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and flutter longer removes more germs.
Wash abundantly with current water.
Wash in a stagnating water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with clean towels or outdoors.
The most often forgotten areas are the inch, the pocket, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and clay nails can host microorganisms.
Hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin injuries that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the water of the robbery and/or soap is not available. For example, to stream water from a suspended and permeated butter or a butter and/or use cedar, if necessary, economic options, in developing countries, such as school, in situations where the water supply and taps for countries is limited or
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended screw using a cord, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussing.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air drying, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 percent on the finger pulp and 254 percent on the palms.
The drying of the hand with air jet led to an average increase of the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42 % and on the palms by 15 %.
After drying hands, the following variations of bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Wash your hands with desinfecting sticks is an alternative solution during moving, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that make reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
The medical washing of the hands should last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands swallow and frost.
The hands must be frozen against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the rubber (and open the output door if applicable).
The goal of washing hands in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to the blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and the front-arms up to the sleeve, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rising, it must be avoided that the water on the front-bras flows up to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand wash were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand wash by more than 35%.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find rubbers to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hands-washing stations.
However, low hands-washing rates can also be due to solid habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands-washing stations can be included in the promotion of hands-hygiene campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Day of Hand Laundering is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behaviour development.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand laundering.
However, a review suggests that promoting hand wash with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fertile smells called myasmes.
For example, in Germany, posts illustrating “good hands-washing techniques” have been placed next to the vessels in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term “washed hands” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be co-worker of something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to supply other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
In the same way, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash hands before and after each meal.
and all chest pains must be treated in this way, particularly at your age.
Especially if you have fever

It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in virus genomes, which are highly likely to result in pressures undertaken during the selection, particularly by the host’s immune system.
As an example, the total loss of ORF4 can be cited in the prototype HCoV-229E root, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-associated cabbage and camel viruses, the alfa-CoV of the alpaga has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a delay of the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also stimulated by the selective pressure exercised in their tank hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms have been detected when covs were infected with covs, indicating mutual adaptation between covs and covs.
It seemed to have been well adapted to the CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, anomalies in activation of pro-inflammatory response in coughs effectively reduce the pathology caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural dead cells in swallows is removed by the positive regulatory receptor inhibiting natural dead cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules of the major class I-histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-reactive derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of the hairs could both eliminate the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exoribonuclease, which would create selective pressure and cause new pathogenic viral roots when they are highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic CoV roots could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics intended for the adaptation of the host.
This is not a chance if three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogeneous or cause moderate symptoms in their hosts tanks such as saurics and camels.
They replicate firmly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe infection in humans.

On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decomposed from the replication of CoV.
The same immune response dissociation strategy could have beneficial effects in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in the hotspots.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 is defective in the swallows.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general scheme by which the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a 95 % nucleotidic homeology sharing beta-CoV with SARS-CoV was discovered, there is also a 96 % nucleotidic homeology sharing beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2.
While targets and other animals present on the market were discovered as identical SARS-CoV virus carriers, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV was discovered remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by humans, whether voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs were returned under the flames of the ramp due to the recent epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in cowboys and other animals has significantly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal tanks in the transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Many factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from cows and are transmitted to man by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and targets present in the markets, the close of the markets of fresh products and the depletion of targets found there could have effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the fresh products markets to avoid zoonoses transmission, given the discovery of many lines of beta-CoV of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolines and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission occurs, will remain to be determined in the following studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromader for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as it was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, associated with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, the cow-souris CoVs, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
There are no opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new more transmissible and/or mortal CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wildlife consumption in some regions of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contacts between humans and animals.
In the face of the ravages caused by SRAS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan for preparation and intervention should be established.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural tanks until an opportunity of contamination occurs.
Although souris have many beneficial characteristics for the spread of viruses, the likelihood for man to be in contact with souris and other wild species can be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to stay away.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way for man to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of natural zoonose tanks.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the SRAS-CoV-2 are still known.
First, if the souris transmit a parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under which circumstances the souris and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the laughter plays a more direct role in the transmission to man, it is necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the laughter.
Thirdly, if a third mammy plays the role of true intermediate host, it remains to clarify how it interacts with different species, including men, sauries and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a saury, a pangolin or another mammals, we should identify SARS-CoV-2 or nearly identical parental viruses observed in their natural hosts.
The future research in this field will clarify the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have significant impacts on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnosis criteria for “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 is needed
On February 6, 2020, our team published a Quick Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV) and this Directive described our experience and provided references to fight this pandemic globally.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge gradually progress on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this e-mail, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a suspect case and a confirmed case according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named acute severe respiratory syndrome for coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO called COVID-19 pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
She has attracted much attention since her publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have experienced seven total editions between January 16 and March 3, 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Our directive, having received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank you.
However, their work must also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Version Test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must associate one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological anxiety: (1) anxiety of travel or residence confirmed in Wuhan and in neighbouring areas and in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days before the occurrence of the symptoms; (2) anxiety of urban contact with SARS-CoV-2 infections or other patients having anxiety of urban contact or (3) anxiety of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imagery with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells indicating a normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte number from the beginning of the symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis should rely on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or seroological evidence: (1) real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequences of the whole viral genome with a strong SAcutif increase with specific phase ≥Gg homogenity with new known phases; (3) seroological testing for SAG to IgM anticorps; (3) IgM anticorps positive test
We can find that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in respiratory or blood samples has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic testing of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020); then the seroological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on researchers' continuous work to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory pathways including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the positive outcome of the specific antibodies in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou and al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as “low-risk”.
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspected cases” and “confirmed cases”, we suggest them to follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our guidelines in time to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country records a mortality record due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Diseases and Research Monitoring (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected people included 114 active cases and 33 healed people remained confined to home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The shutdown of public transport began on 26 March and had to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded the million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted for the prolongation of the national emergency state by 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Human coronavirus zoonotic origins
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the tendency to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal HCoV infection could be.
Most of the HCoVs come from saurics in which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate tank hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV host interactions in animals could also enable better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The Beta-CoV genre contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that sauries and rowers play the role of genetic source for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV tank.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, the HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The tracking of zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors of the crossing of the species’ barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the host(s) of the SARS-CoV-2 tank, intermediate and amplifier, with significant implications in the prevention of future infections.
Animal CoVs are known since the late 1930s.
Over the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory pathways of patients with infection of the upper respiratory pathways in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical fever, including headache, exhaustion, discomfort and throat pain, with fever and throat observed in 10-20% of cases.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present around the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter, in countries with temperate climate.
Shops in Australia reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shop chains of Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase restrictions to two and a package per purchase in all national stores, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently accumulated reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to limit themselves.
Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a package by order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in a March 8 press release, said, with the restriction of four packages in force, "much shops are still in stock breaking within the time after delivery," and called the request for "unprecedented" while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook post, called it "unexpected".
Sales have experienced a “strong increase” last week, according to a Woolworths spokeswoman.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the permitted amount to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered larger packages with suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a scheduled promotion on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local council restrictions on trucks delivery times make the task difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early unlocking of stocks, some stores are unable to honor Wednesday’s promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores rebuild stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a massive item, resulting in stocks of a reduced amount that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, strengthening the impression of a deficiency.
“Coles and Woolworths consider [which] if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rollers and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will likely reduce panic,” Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday they were in stock breaking.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper that manufactures the Sorbent paper, stressed that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers offered free toilet paper to the first entity at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auction sales were organized because buyers were on vacation during the long weekend of the Labour party.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page entry designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially opposed to impose restrictions, according to ABC Australia's March 3 report, in which they announced that they were not planning to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and milk.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the UK Ocado online supermarket restricted the purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rollers.
World Health Organization Calculates COVID-19 Pandemia
Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the current epidemic of COVID-19 (coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the degree of proliferation of the disease, and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO indicated the need to push governments into action:
“Every country can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries pass, test, process, isolate, localize and mobilize their populations as part of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General.
“We are very concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
He said in statements published by CNN in February that “except for flu, no other respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance to its continued global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that “we have never seen a coronavirus pandemic.”
He added: “And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international emergency of public health.
Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: “To shorten, the situation will get worse.”
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an epidemic of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared international emergency public health on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
On April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Almost 364,000 people are healed.
Letality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
The time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and support therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth to shake, staying away from other people, as well as monitoring and limiting people suspected of being infected.
Worldwide authorities have reacted by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantines, fire coverage, risk checks at workplaces and locking facilities.
The pandemic has caused serious socio-economic disturbances at the global level, the delay or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalised shortcomings worsening by panic purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Fake information on the virus has circulated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred to China, other Asian people of origin and appearance from East and Southeast, as well as to other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to the decline in travel and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown case of cause pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were associated with the wholesale sea fruits market in Huanan and therefore it is believed that the virus would be zoonotic.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus discovered recently and closely related to the coronavirus of coughs-souris, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Afterwards, the first known person with symptoms was discovered that the first person with symptoms had been ill on December 1, 2019, and this person had no apparently related products.
In the cases of the first home reported in December 2019, two-thirds proved to have a relationship with the market.
On March 13, 2020, a non-verified South China Morning Post report suggested that the first case could rise to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old man from the province of Hubei. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases seemed to decrease in China but suddenly rise first in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases in times beyond China.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, particularly among those with beneficial symptoms.
On February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19 years old and less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK chief scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before reaching effective collective immunity.
The cases indicate the number of people who have been tested at COVID-19 and whose test has been positively confirmed according to official protocols.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies to not test those who only had good symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, until January 23, 86% of unidentified COVID-19 infections were estimated, and that these unidentified infections were the source of infection of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are healing.
For those who do not heal, the time between the appearance of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common is 14 days.
On April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been caused by COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent suffered from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic usually refer to people who have been positively tested to COVID according to official protocols.
The number of real COVID-19 victims could be much higher, as it might not include untested deceased persons - e.g. at home, in retirement homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy reveal that the numbers of overmortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official number of COVID deaths.
A spokeswoman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized “We know [the number of deaths announced] is underestimated,” a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the subestimation in the United States. Such subestimation often occurs in the 2009 pandemic, as the first decease of January 9 of the pandemic occurred in the first century.
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths per country were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time passed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) to April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case-death report decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between 1 January and 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the rate of mortality (rate of mortality), which represents the percentage of patients diagnosed with suckin, which is not diagnosed with suckin, and the rate of suckin.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in the end of the disease.
Several scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of tests on mortality rate estimates.
The WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni from the State University of Pennsylvania said: “Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to retreat when the disease is missing available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant predictions at the moment that this will happen.”
Chief Medical Advisor Zhong Nanshan said that “it could be completed by June” if all countries managed to mobilize themselves to follow WHO recommendations on measures aimed at spreading the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two.”
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be needed “until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).”
William Schaffner at Vanderbilt University said: “I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—dispatched completely” and that “it could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year.”
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
Covid-19 symptoms are sometimes quite unspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of breathing secretions (mucosities), smell loss, breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, vomiting, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recalls emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and face or blue lip pneumonia; immediate medical treatments are recommended, severe pneumonia is a symptom if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers have issued recommendations that people with close contact with confirmed persons should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese assessments of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between contamination and the appearance of symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is more often than five days. Good example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost the odor was 30% initially before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by heating, exhausting, or speaking; this close contact corresponding to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that glue without protecting itself can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. The breathing droplets can also be projected when expiring, particularly speaking, although the virus is usually not airborne.
Plains can land in the mouth or nose of other people located next to or even be inhaled in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and heartpulmonary reanimation (RCP) can cause respiratory secretions that are powdered and thus lead to air proliferation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, particularly the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it can be transmitted through seals, this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has excluded the possibility of fecuno-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, however spreading can be possible before the symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive to the disease up to three days before the occurrence of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact surveys.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if you still don’t know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Exactly, the virus was detected after three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, after one day on the carton, and after four hours on the copper.
However, this depends on moisture and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positively to COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, such as having been in contact with other surfaces than infected people could have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with the home of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in apparent coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which dissolves its protective enclosure. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be of zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus of the Betac virus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) associated with two roots originating from the coronavirus.
It is 96% identical to the total gene of another samples of coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the gene sequence between the viruses of pangolins and humans.
The comparison of the entire genome has uncovered up to 92 percent of common genetic material between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
The virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but the final confirmation is carried out by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanner.
A study comparing the PCR and Wuhan scanner suggested that the scanner is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less precise, as many of its imagery features coincide with other pathological pneumonia and processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner is not used to depist or as a first-intention test to diagnose COVID-19.”
The WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours or days.
Usually this test is carried out on a rhinopharynx sample but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies currently develop serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for generalized use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic imagery elements on the radiography and the tomodensitometry (scanner) of people with symptoms include asymmetric depolished peripheral glass opacities and absence of pleural stretching.
The Italian Radiology Society currently constitutes an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to recovering with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free imagery is limited to detecting COVID-19.
An important study in China compared the results of thoracic scanners with PCR and showed that if the imagery is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutive neuron networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in imagery both on radiography and scanners.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease generally include having a good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and stirring or stretching into a mosquito and then throwing the mosquito directly into a mosquito bag.
It was recommended for those who had already been contaminated to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have prohibited or unrecommended any non-essential moves to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in vast areas of the planet.
This means that the virus spreads into communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. We advise health professionals who are taking care of someone who could be infected to take the usual precautions as well as transmission health precautions, and to wear future infection determining sources. Contacts searching them is an important method for preventing them.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations publishing a communication calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been launched or offered on the basis of volunteering, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been positively tested to COVID-19. False ideas currently circulate on how to prevent infection; for example, wash their nose and garbage with mouth bath is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are currently trying to develop one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends people to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visiblely dirty; before eating; and after they have wet, wet, or exhausted.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand desinfectant containing a volume of at least 60 % of alcohol when soap and water are not easy to access.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in a minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % etanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hydrochlorite, 0,5 % hydrogen peroxide, and 0,2 % iod povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or a crash, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and automatic distributors are used.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouths and nose with their folded coat or a mosquito when they blow or stretch, and to throw every mosquito immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of the projected posters by speaking, exhausting, and alluring.
The WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “Bringing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection without a good hand hygiene.” The use of masks was also recommended to those who care about a potentially affected person.
The WHO recommended that masks be carried to healthy people only if they face a major risk, for example if they are dealing with a COVID-19 disease, even if it recognizes that mask bearing can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have started to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of healthy medical masks, especially in case of closeness (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or well-known places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited public exit without mask or any other way to cover their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the port of the mask to everyone in public places, so that everyone protects himself and protects others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone who enters a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, imposed the port of the mask to passengers with interurban trains and buses on April 1.
Panama made a mask mandatory for any output, while recommending the manufacture of a craft mask to those who can’t buy it.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also called physical distance) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contacts between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping centers.
The methods of social distance can be applied by staying at home, limiting their travels, avoiding crowds, greeting without contact, and keeping physical distance with others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distance in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of U.S. government and health agencies recommended meetings has quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Elderly adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, clear hypertension, or distance-tapping system occurred in March 2020 experienced as much distance distance, as much as possible, as much as possible, as much as possible.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the belief that it was necessary to use total social isolation, rather than to encourage people to keep contact with others through other means. Some authorities published guidelines on sexual health to be followed during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation of having sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or has no symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to individuals of the most risky groups.
People who have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to be placed in quarantine for 14 days from the last time they were exposed.
The control strategies of an epidemic are stretching or removal, and mitigation.
The endpoint is set in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to track and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are aimed at the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow this spread and to mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
Extension and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures to affect the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic: that is what is called the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Among non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic are personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, mask port and individual quarantine; strict public measures of social distancing, such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a major public effort has been made to promote such interventions as well as a net involvement in China.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass detection and localized quarantine layouts, and has issued alerts on the displacement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected people who have been in quarantine and has imposed severe fines to those who have not done so.
Taiwan has increased mask production and sanctioned the acquisition of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that slowdown (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reducing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2/3 and half deaths, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are undergone.
The removal may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), as otherwise the transmission quickly rebounds during the release of measurements.
The long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no antiviral treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking medication without prescription against cold or drinking as well as rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the gravity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be needed.
Using steroids can aggravate the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and craft remedies" can induce the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for primary hospitals and healthcare services for redistribution of resources at different levels, particularly by dedicating intensive laboratory services to increase COV-19 capability tests, by abolishing non-urgent interventions by testing and, where possible, testing and testing.
There are several theories regarding the place of origin in the first case (called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could go back on December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
They are usually linked to the wholesale sea fruits market of Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An unknown cause pneumonia home was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr Zhang Jixian in Wuhan Province, C.C.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a “coronavirus similar to SRAS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reiterated by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reiterated by its superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public opinion on December 31 and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to launch an investigation at the beginning of January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year’s migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport pole as well as a major railway correspondence site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States crossed China and Italy by showing the largest confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 36,000 were healed.
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movements and established border controls.
The national reactions included measures of degradation such as quarantine (also called orders for staying at home, home or confinement) and fire covers. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are subject to a form of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people in South Africa, and about 59 million in the Philippines.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide experienced a form of confinement, a figure ranging to 2.6 billion days later — about a third of the world’s population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would expire on November 17th.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown case of cause pneumonia on December 26, which she reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Initial genetic tests of patients samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SRAS.
A public opinion was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning of having “prolifered rumors” about the epidemic.
China’s National Health Commission initially argued that there was no “many evidence” of transmission among human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Xi Jinping's Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party as a "people war" to distort the spread of the virus.
In what was described as “the largest quarantin in human history,” a health cord was announced on January 23 to stop travels from and to Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to new hospitals, China has converted 14 other structures to Wuhan, such as convention centres and stages, to temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government has introduced new measures to end the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of Spring holiday leaves.
The universities and schools of the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macao have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work has been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been modified and Chinese museums have been temporarily closed.
The population movement control was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that approximately 760 million people (more than half of the population) were involved in a form or other restriction of movement. After the epidemic entered global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. On March 23, in continental China, one case was transferred within the country in the past five days, in the event via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said the spread of cases transmitted within the country was essentially blocked, and the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were combined in Hubei, other than Wuhan, two months after the start of the confinement. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020 that the entry for holders of a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.
People who want to enter China must apply for a visa in the Chinese embassy or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and gave money recovery plans to businesses. The State Business Council announced a sad day to start with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10:00, which coincides with the Qingming party of COVID, although the central government has physically asked for a refreshment for families to get rid of the line.
It has been confirmed that COVID-19 has spread in South Korea on January 20, 2020 since China.
The National Health Organization reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a Daegu meeting of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.

On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to apply a ban on moving to Wuhan, the representative of the WHO Gauden Galea noted that even if it was not a public recommendation of the WHO in 2009, it was also a public reporting of the WHO, but it was a public reporting of January 30, where it was a "very important indication of the commitment to containing the epidemic."
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the USPPI was due to “the risk of global spread, especially for low-income and middle-income countries without robust health systems.

Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on the road and you need to be ready, adding that the right response measures could help the world to avoid “the worst.”
Ryan said that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we absolutely accept that every human being on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the WHO said that the coronavirus epidemic could be called a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was “extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.” The WHO faced significant criticisms regarding its management of the pandemic, considered inadequate, particularly due to the late statement of emergency of public health and the classification of the virus.

Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, have rejected the first idea that the coronavirus epidemic would have begun to Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories claiming that COVID-19 would have its origins from the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus "China" or "Wuhan" virus, declaring in China that "censure has overfooted a virus now becoming a global pandemic", which was then taxed by racism by some opponents and intended to "return the attention of its administration's inability to contain the disease".

South Korea criticized Japan’s “ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts” after the latter announced that any person coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks on government designated sites.
The South Korean company was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's accusation of the government's bad management of the epidemic or, on the contrary, praised its reaction. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed their concern about the fact that this could enable governments to strengthen their power.

This has also led to a lack of personal protection equipment worldwide and the WHO warns that this will endanger healthcare professionals.
In Australia, the pandemic has offered a new opportunity to the daigous to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a child milk shortage in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the high demand for food that followed, these two areas were saved by serious food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illicit trade of essential products have been a real success, avoiding serious food shortages in Europe and North America.
Thanks to its significant agricultural production, Northern Italy did not see a significant decline, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food rays were only temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government members unlocked pig reserves to ensure sufficient population survival.
Similar laws exist in Italy so that food producers can store reserves for such emergencys.

The Iranian health minister announced Friday’s cancellation of prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to sacred places in La Mecque and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most important interruption of the world sports calendar since World War II.
The most important sports events have either been cancelled or delayed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the England Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH 2019-20 season.
The epidemic disturbed the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which initially had to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but later in the summer 2021". The casinos and other gambling establishments around the world closed and cancelled live poker tournaments were either cancelled.
This has forced many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The show’s world has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or cancelled their concert tournaments.
Many large theatres, such as Broadways, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have searched for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacing traditional live performances, such as online and live concerts or online “festivals” created for artists to produce, distribute and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the theme of the coronavirus have spread because many prefer humor and distraction to uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, a recruitment of prejudice, xenophobia and racism has been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most of the cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received a just punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feeling.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support has been provided to Chinese, whether online or offline, and to residents of areas affected by the virus.
Following the progress of the epidemic towards new sensitive countries, Italians, residents of the first country in Europe to suffer a severe epidemic of COVID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea for the first time signed the Chino-speaking
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become angry on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in racial offences, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for qualifying the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeastern India, who share a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh, the President of the West Bengal Unity, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and that’s why God took revenge on them.
The comments were subsequently condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "fake." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were attracted by the pandemic, while foreigners were described as "external waste" that they should "eliminate".
Many paying access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles related to the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory detection of the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus ARN.
This analysis is specifically designed to only detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibodies tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms were too mild to be declared or asymptomatic.
A precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to a limited survey, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect the reported mortality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be carried out on respiratory samples obtained by means of various methods, including the nasopharynized coil or the expectoration samples.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharynx ecosystems is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat while continuing its multiplication in the lungs.
In infected people tested during the second week, a sample can also be taken into deep respiratory pathways by aspiring catheter, or a crash (expectoration) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 with a reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the base of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the gene “E” shared by all the beta-coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorisation from the Chinese National Administration 2019 Prevention and Diagnostic Control Equipment,Coronavirus Prevention Center for Disease Time,Center for a new SARS-CoV-2 detection kit by US-based PCR.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test on three obtained non-conclusive results due to defective reactors, as well as an outbreak of tests at Atlanta CDCs, thus an average of less than 100 samples per day was successfully treated throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only at this time federal and local laboratories received permission to start the testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorisation.The U.S. commercial laboratories began the testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. Samples must be collected and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was recorded by the Federal Health Monitoring Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19 infection detection test.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing a device to perform 24 hours testing about 4 128.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorisation (US) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the m2000 Abbott system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EEA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses the isothermal reinforcement technology of nucleic acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to intensify manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibodies that specifically connects to the protein of the new coronavirus (protein N) is developing in Taiwan, hoping it can provide results in 15 minutes quickly.
A bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “pulmonary radiography has a low diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of TDM [tomodensitometry] can be conclusive before even the appearance of symptoms.”
Among the typical symptoms visible on the TDM are bilateral polyester glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and lateral distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommends that “TDM is not used for detection or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19.”In March 2020, CDC recommends the PCR for initial detection.
Production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and in the context of population surveillance.The tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or test at the patient's head (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single device blood sample is usually used, although serial samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually taken by skin pointion.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities who have properly informed the agency and therefore can now distribute their antibodies detection tests.
On April 7, 2020, a single test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.Fin March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is significantly faster than the PCR test of the viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.December April, the UK found that none of the antibodies sets purchased by the country were efficient enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan in which suspected cases can stay at home, "the emergency service will provide the patient with a sample tube", patients crashing inside, returning and receive the test result.The British NHS reported that the patient's pre-infected use has a sample-infected driver-infected driver-infected driver-infected driver-infected pilot project to test the suspects in-infected.
The “drive” centers have enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive investigations in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Obligatory Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March that it had the ability to carry out about 12,000 tests per day in ambulancy, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are charged by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to President Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive tests were available in several major cities.
On March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that in the calendar week 12/2020 opens, a total of at least 483 295 samples were tested until week 12/2020 comprised and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) were obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV samples.
Thanks to its five-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modeling revealed that cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47 percent higher and that the cost corresponding to quarantine would have doubled without this detection capacity.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Origami Assays’ multiple free models were published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without liquid robot manipulator.
In March, deficiencies and insufficient amounts of reactives have become a striking goal for mass detection in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation prompted some authors to examine sampling preparation protocols that implies heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue the detection.On March 31, it was announced that the major population of the United Arab Emirates were now the country in the testing of most of its population passing by Coronavirus for the inhabitants.
These results were achieved through a combination of the ability to conduct test drives and the purchase of a broadband laboratory at the population group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to carry out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory to be operating outside China.
Different test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to produce low-income countries sending kits without the resources needed to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control of the United States was published only on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems at the level of reliability of health test kits specialists at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries could respond to the test kits, as well as Australian
On the contrary, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The detection capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of testing programs as the best way to slow down the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the private laboratories in the United States, and the residue reserves are evaporated and reactive.
In March 2020, China reported issues related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, test kits developed by CDCs presented “defects.” The government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered private tests. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that wrong results could be related to the inability to collect samples or properly use the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the missing test kits, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic in China provided false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits in China that proved to be failing.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased in China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them". The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but they were announced in early April 2020.
The detection, followed by the quarantine of those receiving a positive result and the tracking of people who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two series of tests from the total population of about 3,400 people, at about ten days of interval.
Nearly half of the people receiving a positive result had no symptoms, and all the cases found were placed in quarantine.
With the restriction of travel to the municipality, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much less quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as compulsory closure of restaurants and retail facilities.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened at the scheduled date at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with an aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on incoming travels, detection and quarantine, but with less aggressive limitations, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more capable of detecting people with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and national laboratories with only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column “Positive in % tests” depends on the national monitoring policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a positive value in percentage of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether they have or not symptoms, the other factors are the same.
Hand wash, also called hand hygiene, corresponds to the fact that hands are cleaned to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms or other adverse substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by oro-fecal.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, by forgetting to wash hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucus).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby’s feathers or changing its layers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing meat, fish or crush poultry.
If you don’t have water or soap under your hand, you can wash your hands to the cedar. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after preparing the meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the layers of a baby or cleaning a child who went to the toilet;
after stirring or exhausting;
after affecting an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
The hygiene of the hands in the medical environment refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fact that washing hands before administration of medicines or prodigal medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of the washing of hands is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but also for the public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of child mortality rates in childbirths at home.
According to a 2013 study, improving hands hygiene practices could lead to slight improvement in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by nearly 50%.
The implementation of actions aimed at promoting hand laundering could reduce the episodes of diarrhea by about a third, a comparable figure to the achieved by providing low-income regions with drinking water.
Wash your hands with soap reduces the diarrhea episodes by 48% and is the most effective and costly way to prevent acute diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which accounts for nearly 1.8 million victims per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause nearly 3.5 million children to die every year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce almost half the deaths caused by diarrhea and a quarter of the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Hand wash is usually associated with other health measures within the water, health and hygiene programs (WASH).
Handwashing also protects from impotence, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
Minor deterrent effect, frequent washing of hands can break the skin by causing skin drying.
A Danish 2012 study revealed that excessive hands-washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis at the hands, characterized by squameous skin and diarrhoea, and particularly common in health workers.
Too frequent washing of hands is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsory obsessional disorder (TOC).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of the diseases: before and after using the toilets (mixing, defection), after cleaning a baby's feces (or changing its layers), before feeding a baby, before eating and before and after preparing foods or meat, cattle or fish.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, particularly before and after curing a cure or injury, after exhausting, stirring or moisturizing, after touching animal waste or manipulating animals and after touching dirt.
In many countries, the rate of cleaning of hands to soap is low.
According to a study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries and carrying hands hygiene, 38.7% average households washed their hands with soap. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was in Saudi Arabia that the highest rate of use was day-to-day (97%), the U.S. was in the middle of table (77%), and the lowest rate was shown in China.
For example, the Ministry of Education of the Philippines has implemented a "Primer Health Care Program" to promote children's health and education.
The deparasite twice a year, associated with daily wash of hands with soap and teeth brushing with fluored toothbrush, is the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or dishwashers should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and dishwashers is to reduce the barriers to the solution and increase solubility.
The water alone is not an effective cleaner for the skin because the lipids and proteins, which are organic substances of the soil, are hardly soluble in the water.
However, an adequate flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can close bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria are rinsed with mushroom.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also states that “automatic liquid soap distributors are better.”
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended to people concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence suggesting that the use of recommended antiseptics or desinfectants allows to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many roots of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant stems are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, these may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protective agent, the most complex formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having a common antimicrobial function, and other common health agents were effective as well as the common health agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthole, and plant extracts).
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria increase much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, soft and soap water is more effective than cold and soap water to eliminate natural oils carrying dirt and bacteria.
But unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of soft water did not contribute to reducing microbial load on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for the hands is a product of non-aquatic hands hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-aquatic alcohol-based hand hygiene products (called hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic solutions for hand or hand desinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol associated with a thick agent such as carbonate (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or a moisturizing agent such as glycerine to obtain a liquid or mould for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances the antimicrobial activity.The disinfectants for the hands containing at least 60 to 95 % alcohol effectively eliminate the germs.
Hydroalcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Water alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria present on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of anti-batteric bacteria present on hands 1 minute after application.
Hydroalcohol solutions are almost completely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of disinfectant for hands or hydroalcohol solution must be used to either wet or cover both hands.
The dust and back of both hands should be faced as well as the interstices between fingers and nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, mush or gel is dried.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands rather than using hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when hands are visiblely dirty.
Increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequately washing hands unless you have water and soap in your hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcohol solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emulsionants and/or hydrating agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other emulents to the formula.
As part of clinical trials, hydroalcoholic solutions containing emolients have caused much less irritation and skin dryness than soaps or antimicrobial waste agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aquatic products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand desinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogenic agents, as these remain on hand.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hands desinfectants is strongly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based desinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have presented a durable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many are those who do not have the means of buying soap, and rather use cedar or soil.
Cinderella or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if soil or cedar is contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of diseases instead of braking it.
Like soap, cedar is also a desinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends properly washing hands to prevent the transmission of diseases, following the following steps:
Wash your hands with tears or cold water.
The common water is recommended due to the risk of contamination of stagnating water points, while the water temperature does not seem to make a difference).
Make a generous amount of soap mowing on your hands by frosting them against each other, without forgetting the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap eliminates skin germs, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Frot for at least 20 seconds.
The flutter action creates friction, which helps to eliminate the germs of the skin, and flutter longer removes more germs.
Wash abundantly with current water.
Wash in a stagnating water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with clean towels or outdoors.
The most often forgotten areas are the inch, the pocket, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and clay nails can host microorganisms.
Hydrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having dry hands; skin dryness promotes the appearance of skin injuries that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to wash your hands when the water of the robbery and/or soap is not available. For example, to stream water from a suspended and permeated butter or a butter and/or use cedar, if necessary, economic options, in developing countries, such as school, in situations where the water supply and taps for countries is limited or
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended screw using a cord, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a soap bread.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is discussing.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study financed by the whole paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and more modern air-dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot-air drying, it was revealed that the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194 percent on the finger pulp and 254 percent on the palms.
The drying of the hand with air jet led to an average increase of the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42 % and on the palms by 15 %.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential cross contamination with other toilet users and the environment of toilets according to each method.
The air jet dryer, which breathes out of the apparatus at advertised speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to explode microorganisms from the hands and the apparatus and potentially contaminate other toilet users as well as the toilet environment in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air dryer allows microorganisms to spread at a distance of up to 0.25 metres of the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After drying hands, the following variations of bacterial number were observed:
There are many different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Wash your hands with desinfecting sticks is an alternative solution during moving, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions should contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of hands in the medical environment became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that make reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
A study found that their use led to a decrease in infection rates.
The medical washing of the hands should last for at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to make each part of the hands swallow and frost.
The hands must be frozen against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hair brush to remove them.
As the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to wash well and wash with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the rubber (and open the output door if applicable).
This prevents the recontamination of hands to contact surfaces.
The goal of washing hands in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, the proper washing of hands and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of cateters-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure to follow for washing and brushing hands in the field of health.
The draft manual hygiene guidelines established by the Organization can also be consulted on the website to collect comments from users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Devices available in trade can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with the regulation is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" regarding hand hygiene:
after exposure to the blood/biological liquid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
after having contact with the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "medical" or "antimicrobial") causes the hand-washing agent a destruction action of the germs.
It is desirable to eliminate these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To "frottle" hands in order to surgery, it is necessary to have a rubber base that can be removed after a rubber base that can be opened and shut out the instruments without touching it with the hands, and from the product sxio.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash the hands and the front-arms up to the sleeve, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to brush your hands for 10 minutes.
When rising, it must be avoided that the water on the front-bras flows up to the hands.
Once the hands are washed, it is appropriate to dry hands with the help of a sterile garment and fill a surgical jacket.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand wash were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and there were only few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand wash by more than 35%.
If we compare hand wash with a regular soap done with an antibacterial soap, the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted to foods is more than three times higher. Similarly, by comparing hand wash with an alcohol-based solution and the washing of the hands with an antibacterial soap with a second contamination ratio, the average decreases the bac for 2 seconds for 30 seconds.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce the flu virus A (H1N1) and the Clostridium difficult spores on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of the hands in healthcare institutions, it is possible, in particular, to train the staff at hand wash, and to put more alcohol-based products on hand.
More research is needed to find out what are the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, wash of hands with soap is considered an affordable and essential tool for maintaining health or even eating properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, soap or facilities to wash your hands at home, at school and at work, it is difficult to establish universal hands hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find rubbers to wash hands near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hands-washing stations.
However, low hands-washing rates can also be due to solid habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting the washing of hands with soap and carrying out awareness-raising activities in this regard can influence political decisions, bringing to know the benefits of this practice and leading to long-term changes in behaviour within the population.
In order to achieve this approach, monitoring and evaluation activities are necessary.
A systematic examination of 70 studies has shown that local approaches are effective to increase the rate of hand wash in low and medium-sized countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to promoting hand wash in schools, we can provide simple rules to take the example of "the Approach of three stars" to any cost, which encourages the UNICEF,
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hands-washing stations can be included in the promotion of hands-hygiene campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Day of Hand Laundering is another example of awareness campaign that claims to promote behaviour development.Due to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand laundering.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness ratio of hand wash in developing countries compared to the number of healthy years of life gained (i.e., DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that promoting hand wash with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand-washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable people such as mothers coming from acquisition or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of the British Hand Hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweiss Night, who founded it in Vienna.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to fertile smells called myasmes.
In the 1980s, food epidemics and nasocial infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means to prevent infection spread.
The emergence of pig influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries about the need to wash hands with soap to prevent these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posts illustrating “good hands-washing techniques” have been placed next to the vessels in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The term “washed hands” refers to the refusal of a person to assume responsibility or to be co-worker of something.
It comes from a Bible verse of Matthew, in which Pontius Pilate washs his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in a compulsory way to try to clean up an imaginary spot, symbol of her misconception in the face of the crimes she committed and that she incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering to have committed acts contrary to ethics or have planned to do so, tend to wash their hands more often than others and give more value to hands-washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to supply other compensatory measures of "purification", such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe the washing of hands for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of washing of hands advanced in many religions, including the Bahá'ísm and the Hinduism, the washing of the hands in the same way.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands after going to the toilet.
In the same way, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require to wash hands before and after each meal.
Covid-19 risk controls at work
Covid-19 risk controls at work designate the implementation of health and safety methods for risk control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls at work vary depending on workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of risks from exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs at lower exposure risk have a minimum professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures are recommended, including hands-washing routine, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, and keep the label clean.
Average exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contacts with people without suspected or known COVID-19 but may be infected due to an ongoing Community transmission or an international journey.
This includes workers in contact with the public, particularly in schools, high-population density work environments and some large-scale retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using highly efficient air filters, hygiene glasses and the provision of individual protection equipment in case of encountering a person with COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to people with suspected COVID-19 or known as having a high risk of exposure, to a very high risk if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or samples or samplings of people with suspected or known COVID-19.
The appropriate risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are sick, need to take care of other people or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both with regard to the required goods and the means of acquiring them (e.g. doing their courses outside of high-performance hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, shipment of items from severely affected geographical regions can be discontinued. A plan for preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective measures.
The plans shall take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, family and community-related risk factors and individual working risk factors such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also need the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may occur as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparation and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people with higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms a broadly used framework in health and safety at work to group risk controls by effectiveness.
When COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and ultimately individual protection equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from the risks associated with work without having to rely on workers' behaviour, which can be the most economical solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls designate changes in policy or procedures at work that require action by the employer or the employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPIs must be selected according to the risk for the worker, properly adapted according to the needs (e.g. respiratory masks), properly and systematically weared, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced according to the needs, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or retrieved to avoid any contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, lower exposure risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic measures of prevention of infection recommended for all workplaces include a frequent and careful washing of hands, encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are ill, breathing label, including covering the mouth and nose routine to shake and exhausting equipment, providing hands and bubbles to work, and preparing for hours to work or to take care of.
Fast identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at workplaces.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommends that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms from at least 24 hours of family use to allow the use of these policies of feverfibres or other drugs acting on the symptoms.
According to OSHA, average exposure risk jobs include those who require frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of people without suspected or known COVID-19, but who can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to a community transmission running around the company’s headquarters or because the COVID-19 recently conducted a cross-country travel with a region.
This includes working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working working.
Workers of this risk group rarely need to use respiratory masks.
If a person is sick on a plane, the appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the following measures: separate the sick from others by a distance of 6 feet, designate a crew member to take care of the sick and offer a mask to the sick or ask him to cover all the mouth or nose with the help of the nose.
The cabin crew must wear fitted medical gloves when dealing with a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated organic liquids or surfaces and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or respiratory difficulties.
Towels and other jetable items must be put in a bag for dangerous organic waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk checks often include the delay of the journey in the case of disease, as well as the self-isolation and other isolated ship information.
Ideally, medical monitoring must be carried out in the cabin of the isolated person. For school and child care facilities, CDCs recommend a short-term closing for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has entered a school building, regardless of Community propagation.
In case of minimum or moderate Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outputs, meetings and other important meetings such as physical or choral education courses or cantine meals, increasing the space between children with significant symptoms, increasing the space between children by using grips in time of arrival and departure.
In case of important transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, a prolongation of school holidays can be considered. For the order forces carrying out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDCs.
Order forces officers who have to contact people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as ambulance officers, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In case of close contact during a arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service ceiling before re-use using a lingerie or household dishwasher and follow the standard procedures for confinement and receipt of used EPIs as well as confinement and laundering of clothes.
The OSHA considers some sanitary and funeral workers to belong to categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk exposure jobs include healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high risk of exposure workers if they perform procedures producing aerosols or samples or sampling of suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
Proceedings producing aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopes, certain dental examinations and procedures or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people suspected of COVID-19 or known at the time of their death; they have a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsie. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for suspected or known patients with COVID-19, including procedures for the implementation of
Specialized negative pressure ventilation can be suitable in some sanitary and funeral environments.
Samples must be manipulated using level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the separation of patients entering separate waiting rooms based on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, the OSHA recommends respiratory masks for people who work less than 6 feet from patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV infection.
In the United States, N95 filtering masks approved by the NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including adaptation, training and medical exams.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and better comfort for the worker. The WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic fluids.
The WHO recommends carrying a surgical mask only by the check-in staff at the input point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures producing aerosols, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective glasses or a face screen, a blouse and gloves.
In case of a procedure producing aerosols, the surgical mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since global supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for EPIs through telemedicine, individual physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the access to a location occupied by a patient EPIs but the coordination of individuals directly involved in its care, but also disproto the use of EPIs to take the necessary only task.

OBJECTIVE: [Covid-19] Reducing the burden and preparing the future
Date of year: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in an exceptional situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the type of empathy, cooperation and global strengthening that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in emails, calls and instant conversations are a remarkable witness to the incredible human beings with whom we have the opportunity to work with.
I couldn't be grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone told me about his gratitude to our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to see Wikipedia at the moment, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to everyone.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and the role you play there, we will make consistent adjustments to how we work together from next week.
adjustments of our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team met last night to discuss our approach and time employment in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what we think would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and the best way to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We should first of all eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don’t worry.
To all staff members, subcontractors and contractors:
our daily working time goal will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until new order.
We will not declare a holiday: if you are able to provide more normal working hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and if you need to take care of your relatives, run or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying it, but we say it.
No sickness stop or paid leave required: simply warn your superior and help your team review schedules and time jobs to ensure that the main areas of work are covered.
(If you have been diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please warn Bryan from the T&amp;C Ops department to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from the direction).
The timeline staff will be fully paid.
We have already announced this, and we will reiterate our commitment to respecting our responsibilities to our subcontractors and our members of the timeline staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual working hours under normal conditions.
It’s worth if you’re sick and inability to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly satisfying, especially in periods like this.
Again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we are waiting for and we can take the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, Ops RH, Confiance &amp; Security and Fund Collection teams (among others) carry out an essential work that may need reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the essential tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will simply focus on the most important projects.
Slowing now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to “work twice as much to catch the lost time” when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to comply with now unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will strive to set up new objectives and, where appropriate, expire.
What about the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and our daily working time goals, we are planning to adjust the deadline for delivery of our annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to set up a budget to allow employees to focus on essential work, take care of them and their relatives while adapting to those who need or want to see their reduced work schedule in the coming weeks.
This prolongation of deadlines significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as confirmed.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues could have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
However, by excess caution, we have used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-quality antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and lift cages leading to our floor.
The building has used its own diligence duty protocol that uses products to ensure the safety of its renters.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork site, which shared with us and all Washington DC-based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration in accordance with San Francisco’s advice.
As some of our colleagues are known in New York, we have also discussed the idea of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may be updated.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our usual remote work colleagues are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wish to give you some advice:
Reducing the duration of meetings to sessions by a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider distributing them in several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have a agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make the standard videos using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Having a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor instant conversation and the speaker list, and someone who helps to take notes (or perform a collective notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your well-being refund for collats.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your work distribution colleagues
The RH Operations Team is studying ergonomic webinar-based guidelines to support increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-tons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to achieve their agreed grant activities and that no one would be punished in the event of delay or modification of these objectives.
Next week, we will publish additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sad and relief in the face of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
Consequently, the CRT is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite COVID-19 problems
We will send an invitation to your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here, you can always find the information contained in this email as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages and collect all information in the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff residents in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, important workflow or covering difficulties, or if you need help for anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with CRT.
We are here to support you and ensure the connection if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations RH.
No such amendments should be considered a resignation of our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is to recognize that our work and obligations will likely have to be adapted in an unprecedented manner.
These steps are those we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to bring our movement the help he needs, and to offer to the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us to come.
At the moment, it is time to contribute and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months to come.
We need each one of you to show that it is necessary for you to preserve and take care of your families, so that you may be able to give the best of your hope at the right time.
Finally, please, wash your hands and touch not your face.
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the external face (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
The ACE2 against the activity of angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of certain coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 is a metal enzyme containing zinc located on the surface of endotelial cells and other cells.
The protein ACE2 contains a terminal peptidase M2 domain and a terminal C-transporter amino acid collection domain.
ACE2 is a single-passed membrane protein of type I whose active enzyme domain is exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is clived from the transmembranary domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the soluble protein resulting in it is released into the blood flow and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked mainly to the cell membrane of the cells of type II pulmonary alveoles, enterocytes of the gland intestine, blood and vein endothelial cells and blood cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2's RNA is also present in the brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain tronc.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE stimulates the hormone angiotensine I into vasoconstricting angiotensine II.
ACE2 in turn clives the phenylamino acid carboxyl termination of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyse in angiotensine vasodilatator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-ProOH).
ACE2 can also climbing several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinine, apeline, neurotensine, dynorphine A, and ghréline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membranary circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembranary protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SRAS-based virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (covid-19-based virus).
More precisely, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicul protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the surface of cells results in endocytosis and in the translocation of both the virus and enzyme in the endosomes within cells.
This input process also requires the morning of protein S by host proteinase TMPRSS2, the inhibition of the latter is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended to continue the standard treatment using ACE and ARB inhibitors.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to tested subjects.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular victims of AVC and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less proven than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The conversion enzyme of human recombinant angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) is pressured as an innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory disorder syndrome induce by lipolysacharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to the classical rhinine-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA) or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. rhACE2 under infusion has been evaluated as part of clinical trials for the treatment of respiratory disorder syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, i.e. identification of people (“contacts”) that may be in contact with an infected person.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in certain territories and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracking applications.
These systems, particularly those based on the tracking of the geographic location of app users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intriguing options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record the closeness of a user with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration in their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that enables supporting these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has, as regards it, chosen for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computing community, it was provided in open source and will be remitted to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth application that ensures exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technologies and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the application for contact tracking was at an advanced stage of development and could be implemented over the next few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce an application of geosurgery for patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and residents in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, raised several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including fake positives and potential lack of efficiency if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only authorizes “official” or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists reported their concerns about the implications of coronavirus applications in mass surveillance, in particular the potential dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to cope with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of this type of surveillance.
These organizations have set eight conditions to be fulfilled in the framework of government projects:
supervision should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
the extensions of control and supervision should include clauses of extinction;
the use of data should be limited to the aims of combating COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
Digital monitoring should ensure that there is no worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Protection against abuse and recourse should be provided for for citizens in the event of abuse;
The "significant participation" of all "interesting parties" would be mandatory, including the of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of continuity of monitoring by removing the mechanism of tracking the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data have significant potential issues with respect to privacy.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, allowing privacy to be respected (see section below).
In South Korea, a system not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system has collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile devices tracking data and card transactions, which are then associated to send SMS alerts to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information accessible to the public, which was authorized due to deep changes in the data protection laws after the MERS epidemic affected this country.
This information is accessible to the public through multiple applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have envisaged the use of centralized systems to preserve privacy.
The details had not yet been reported on April 6, 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record the closeness of a user with other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordinating effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a unique protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), Mobile Contact Numbers (formerly called Contact Event Numbers, CEN), and other Tracchantive Me Protocols
These protocols allow you to ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all correspondence is done on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab currently develops SafePaths, a platform for use of privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using localization or contact data in order to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies originally based at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising their privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the release of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, who control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, declaring that it would allow privacy to be preserved and associated with Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption ensuring privacy.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications for privacy
Google and Apple plan to resolve the problems of adoption of the solution and continuity of monitoring by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and subsequently deleting it once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a drug (also called reorientation, reprofiling, reaffectation or change of therapeutic indication of a drug) means the reconversion of an approved drug for a disease or for a medical condition other than that for which it was initially developed.
This is a scientific research axis currently studied to develop safe and effective treatments against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the plasma transfusion of convalent people. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligands linkage sites.
The analysis of these linking sites offers the realistic development project of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain type proteinase, dependent RNA RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, and al. studied several candidate compounds that they subsequently optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a anti-palude drug also used against certain auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and apparent hydroxychloroquine would be part of the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an EU emergency use authorisation.
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the U.S. only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that “use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors told us to use this medicine “if there is no other option.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts a test on the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed favipiravir was “clearly effective”.
35 patients in Shenzhen were negatively tested within an average period of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir and the other half fumafenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is thin and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug in Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the drug to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe opened opportunities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that “no benefit was observed”.
These drugs have been designed to inhibit replication of HIV by binding to proteinase.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would be linked to SARS-CoV-2 proteinase. There are criticisms in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for repositioning of specially developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity test.
The remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that the remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against several filovirus, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause a more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the test suggested that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland university hospitals; one on individuals with moderate pathology and the other on those with more severe forms.
There are three clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began tests on azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Health and Global Medicine Center (NCGM) provides a clinical trial on alvesco (cyclosonide) of Teijin, a corticosteroid for inhalation used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of enzyme conversion of angiotensin 2 is underway with 200 patients recruiting among severe hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada currently study the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from moderate COVID-19 symptoms.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years and older who have been diagnosed positively with COVID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are testing in Italy.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian medicine agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicentric study of 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SRAS and Western Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical trials, many development attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were underway in phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was declared worldwide in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the essentials of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms conducted research and development projects in early 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the main platform passed in phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the CEPI scientists said in April, 115 vaccine candidates were at the first stages of development, 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other advertised, but with little public information available (suspected during planning or design).
A phase I-II test conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres all, determining more accurate doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the efficacy of the vaccine in disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human person’s assessment phase (always in preclinical research).
At around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it would study the potential of a molecular pince vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
At around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced it had started working on a vaccine, of which human tests should start in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that he had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen lab in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neo-antigen vaccine used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the Director of the Research Institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and began testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create a peptide-based Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in men “ within 90 days”.
On March 5, 2020, the University of St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both located west of Maryland, announced working on a vaccine.
About 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced to join Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced preclinical test projects and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even in an accelerated procedure it would take about a year and a half to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec, Quebec, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle through partial financing of Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is undergoing laboratory research, and human tests are scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, the Guardian announced that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac “strong amounts of money to benefit from exclusive access to COVID-19 vaccine,” which led to the German government’s protest.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an ARNm-based vaccine.
The ARNm BNT162 vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical test phase with the start of the expected clinical trials in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the test on the man of its final vaccine candidate could start in autumn.
In France, March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparation Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pittsburgh University, bringing $29 million of COVID-19 to the total investment in CEPI.
The other investment partners of the CEPI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing on animals of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at the Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of the sending of the sequence by China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical contra-actions against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Almost at the same time, the Canadian government announced the award of $192 million C dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with projects for the creation of a national “vaccin bank” containing several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus epidemics occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, claiming that “sub-unities of SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines administered by microns triggered a significant response of antimunal specific antibodies after the week.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities shared their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with computer resources hosted on the cloud from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized study in Australia plans to include 4,170 healthcare professionals.
It is possible that developing vaccines are not safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of a vaccine using COVID-19 animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates the need to implement levels 3 biosecurity confinement measures for living virus manipulation, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
SRAS and MERS vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine against SRAS that has both demonstrated its safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SRAS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that existing SRAS research could be a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, a single MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans and three others were underway; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vectors (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social media have published a complot theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents related to genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus roots such as SRAS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, taste loss and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
While most cases cause moderate symptoms, some evolve to a viral pneumonia and a multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often by drops produced by shaking, shaking or speaking.
Since these droplets are produced at expiry, they usually fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk on long distances.
People can also be infected by touching an infected surface, then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although infection is possible before the appearance of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the public generally vary, some authorities do not recommend their use, others do not recommend their use, and others do not require their use.
There is currently no vaccine or antiviral treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of the WHO.
People infected with the virus can be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a face or blue lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is recommended to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as extraction, nasal flow or throat pain can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China had initially only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
That's what we call the period of incubation.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can last up to 14 days.
97.5 percent of people who develop symptoms will do this within 11.5 days after the infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is still not fully known, however, preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and in the study. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Committee began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; from 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoration and saliva can both carry significant viral loads.
To speak loudly frees more drops than to speak normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that shaking without protecting itself can design droplets at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patients' chambers produced positive samples of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and heartpulmonary reanimation (RCP) can disperse respiratory secretions and thus lead to air proliferation.
Although there are concerns about spreading through the seeds, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spreading may be possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that if you still don’t know exactly how easy the disease is to spread, one person usually contaminates two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surface.
Precisely, the virus was detected after a day on the carton, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on the 99% copper.
This varies, however, depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and eliminates the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical desinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salive samples were taken on average two days after the hospitalization.
In five in six patients, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with the home of Wuhan acute respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus apparent in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the domestic soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the enzyme of conversion of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the lung alveolar cells of type II.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called spicul (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and penetrate the host cell.
Acute heart injuries have been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital in China, and are more common when the disease is more severe.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, however acute lesions of the myocard may also be associated with ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
The receptors of ACE 2 are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and vein thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients with intensive care units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with a disadvantaged prediction. Covid-19 deceased people's autopsy showed diffuse alveolar damage in inflammating infiltrates (DAD) and infiltrates.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory pathways expressing ACE-2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
These are particularly GM-CSF secretary T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL6 and severe pulmonary pathology of COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocyte infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharynized sampling; however, a nasal sampling or expectoration can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so laboratories around the world were able to develop independently of PCR tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (sensitive to detect active infections and previous infections of a person) were being developed, but still not widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed precision of only 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first test nearest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods of detection of infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobaric bilateral depolished glass opacytes with peripheral, asymmetric and subsequent distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Domination under pleural, crazy paving (interlobulary septal examination with variable alveolary comb) and consolidation may appear with the progression of the disease.
There are little data available on microscopic injuries and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurosis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinuclear gigantic cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolary damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolary exsudats.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxiemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exsudates in alveolar cavity and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disinfected intravascular coagulation (CIVD); leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding bonded places, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having a good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a mosquito when scratching or stretching and using the inside of the mosquito in the absence of mosquito.
A correct hand hygiene after shaking or exhausting is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with the help of a fabric in public places to limit transmission in case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact with infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing displacements and regrouping significantly.
Distance guidelines also include respect for a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no medicine known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 earlier, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic pic, which is also called the "covering curve".
The CDC also recommends individuals to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visiblely dirty; before eating; and after they have wet, wet, or exhausted.
It also recommends using a disinfectant solution for hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where disinfectants for hands are not available, the WHO offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulas, antimicrobial activity comes from etanol or isopropanol.
The hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol, it is “not an antiseptic active substance for the hands.”
glycerol is added as a moisturizing agent.
People are treated with support care that can include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected to be carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure cases, but its benefits are still analyzed.
Personal hygiene, lifestyle and healthy diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful in those who have moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people for COVID-19.
Reanimating physicians and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
As for the symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) rather than ibuprofene in the first line.
Cautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, particularly in care conditions when conducting procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals who take care of people suffering from COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an air-infected isolation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions relating to air-to-air transmission protection.
Recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, the respiratory masks (for face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respiratory masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an emergency use permit (USA).
They are designed to protect air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific organic agents is not guaranteed for non-indicated uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial protection screens, or last remedies, craft masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases is.
The type of respiratory assistance for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized people. Some evidence indicates that intubation can be avoided using a broad-speed nasal canal or positive pressure of double-level respiratory pathways.
It is unknown whether one or both generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to keep invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the distribution of aerosol particles compared to a broad-band nasal canal. Severe cases are more common in older adults (these older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the system’s ability to treat a sudden peak of the number of COVID-19 cases serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the cases were admitted in intensive care, 2.3% needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 percent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally allowed in intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices that provide pressure control modes and high PEEPs are necessary to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of pneumonia-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The search for potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical trials.
Remisedivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended to volunteers to participate in tests on the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has issued temporary plasma authorisation of convalent people as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The application is able to detect “near contacts” using monitoring data and therefore to detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of mass data on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people in South Sing, and contacted with them in Korea.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate mobile phone data of people suspected of having the coronavirus.
The measure aimed at respecting quarantine and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch, to analyze and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera has been informed by mobile phone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent coronavirus spread.
People can suffer from quarantine, displacement restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC said Rory O'Connor, who said, “increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have moderate evolution with little or no symptoms, similar to other common diseases of the respiratory pathways such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection according to similar virus data, such as SRAS and MERS, but there is no data on COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly advance to an acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multivisceral failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include septiemia, coagulation disorders and heart, kidney and liver injuries.
Coagulation disorders, particularly an increase in prothrombine time, were described in 6% of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of people in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have a high level of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the beginning of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between the beginning of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem pulmonary samples show diffuse alveolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exsudats in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles an acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart injuries caused by high troponin levels or heart attack were observed.
According to data from March from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The sub-numeration of moderate cases may lead to a over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and have a 2.4 times higher risk of intense care or decay compared to non-smokers. There were also concerns in relation to long-term sequels of the disease.
The hospital administration of Hong Kong observed a decrease of 20% to 30% of the respiratory capacity in some people healed of the disease, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic injury.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether an earlier infection had effective long-term immunity in people who were healed of the disease.
Immunity is considered likely, based on other coronavirus behaviour, but cases of people healed from COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be a worsening of latent infection rather than a re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and animal by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively led by a human transmission to humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of symptom emergence was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first appearance of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are usually used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by regions and time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time that has passed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO affected CIM-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for confirmed deaths in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 laboratory for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed in laboratory. Death/reflection ratio
According to the University of Johns-Hopkins statistics, the global death toll is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to April 17, 2020.
This number varies per region. Other measures include the rate of mortality (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the rate of infected mortality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in the end of the disease.
Although all infected people do not develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease has spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and all COVID-19-related deaths may not have been officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rate are different in both men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest among 50-year-olds, the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% in men and 1.7% in women.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences according to gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women and development in men of comorbidity such as less advanced hypertension than in women could have contributed to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the people died from COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data associated with COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS affect differently men and women.
A higher percentage of healthcare personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be “Covid-19”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), to an animal species or a group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The COVID-19 virus is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “covid-19 virus” and “covid-19 virus” in its public communication.
The disease and the virus are both commonly called the coronavirus.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called “coronavirus” and “coronavirus of Wuhan”.
In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of 2019-nCov pre-order disease and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of places in the names of disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as rollers and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the supplier couldn’t supply it in time, a local startup returned and printed the required 100 valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, complotist theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
Man seems to be able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, candles and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response from the human body in case of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, sub-unity vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensibilizes the immune system to certain sub-unities of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focuses on spicul protein S that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid-based vaccines (ADN or RNA vaccination, a new vaccination technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous genetic code copied on the virus that causes the disease. Dependent antibody activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials assessed already approved treatments against malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs represent the majority of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of COVID-19 vaccine candidates and drugs was also established in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs were evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta-interferon.
Provisional data suggest the effectiveness of remedezivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, some demand an independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend using chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although it recommends a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and could be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorisation at the discretion of COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umyphenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating a low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicul protein melting using serum 2 transmembranous protein (TMPRSS2) is essential for the input of SARS-CoV-2 SARS'P with re-interaction.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limits that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytochin shock can be a complication at subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytoquine anti-chock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is underway non-randomized phase 2 test at national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe form of disease.
Associated with a serum ferritine blood test to identify cytoquinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to be the origin of the deaths of certain people affected.
The antagonist of the interleukine-6 receptor was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the refractory cytokines releasing syndrome to steroids induce by a different cause, CAR T cell treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence indicating that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by the immune systems of people who have been healed from COVID-19 to people who need it is to be studied as a non-vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SRAS with little final results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based treatment can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular dependent cytotoxicity of antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are being developed.
Serum production of convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of healed patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
