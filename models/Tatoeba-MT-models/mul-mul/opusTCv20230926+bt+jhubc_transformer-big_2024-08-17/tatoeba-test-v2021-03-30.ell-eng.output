Rome was not built in one day.
I like to dance.
It's gonna be all right.
Why didn't you come here?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom is now living in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow this.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're laughing.
Tell me what you're going to take at the exams.
I think two languages are not enough.
Can you borrow your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put it?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come to see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You are much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm ashamed.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna go home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not going to lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
You ask me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The fish egg isn't my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anybody?
He's a student of Yutsu's gym.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with this.
They lost again.
Tom would do everything for you.
It's all right?
What is the title of your new book?
You make me joke?
Can I find out where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We broke the house green.
The time and place of the meeting have been closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoting recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love the flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Soap makes good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
He kiss him.
Tom said he didn't want anything to eat.
I'm gonna stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sorry.
I wish I couldn't be Canada.
Anything that shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
He hits my phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head higher than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who he was with me at his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You are not Canadians.
Who's this?
Tom forgot his bag on the train.
They killed our laughter.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw that girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone hits.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas stays in a communion with hips.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
It was an emergency.
Wear expensive shoes.
Someone's here?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These are not fish.
This is a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canada?
People today give more importance to popular culture than in the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll come back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you break your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love it.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How did you spend your holidays?

I'm here, have we invited?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom caught Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
You know who he is?
Have you seen the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a matter of money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot to live like humans.
I learned a lot.
We don't trust foreigners.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to do sport.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was extravagant.
It's about.
Where's your friend?
Do you know a Greek myth?
He closed the 40s.
What time are you going?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain welcomed us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her with lovely poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom's hanging Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
How do you call that?

The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's screwed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He's talking frenchly.
I'm higher than you.
Have you lost the proof?
Fear not to lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will come back?
Tom has no red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm an immeasurable.
I think Tom's drunk.

Tougher, please.
You're my own.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I'm not coming here too often.
I'm gay.
You're easy.
He's not a hero, Tom.
I'm happy that I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys are not mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I'm telling you, and I'm telling you again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like the archs.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You destroyed her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.

What's bringing you here?
I've been sleeping.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.

Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.

Can you remove from 10 to six?
Don't stop!

I've got tears.
He's talking like a truck.
When are you reading?

No one could imagine it.
It'll be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared me dinner.
I would like to speak all European languages.

They're red.
He said something.
Since I've been married, I'm not working anymore.
Why do you hate Canada so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a wearing?
I'm grateful for doing it.
And I'm a little tired.
Are you sure you don't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father a Japanese?
Be careful, please!
Are you sure you downloaded the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time are they starting?
I'm in the stoop now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.

They didn't know me.
I'll fight.

Who cares about it?
Tell me what you want.

All the visitors have gone.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come out.
I wish I had been born a Canadian.
You're intolerant.
You're intolerant.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the discussion.
Please note: In English, we're highlighting the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build stores?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Chirilos; I am glad to know!
She has good legs.
His current behaviour confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is that you are not a Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Will he come?
Tell us where to go.
Same walked and got in the toilet in Layla.
When I grow up, I'm going to be a pilot.

Tom was driving his car.
We laughed.
Take me with you.
I gotta go to bed.
Both are alive.
They'll fix him.

You made the same mistake again.
Kate is almost never celebrating her birthday.
How much do you want to pay?
Are you not happy?
Excuse Tom.
Tom's a little smaller than your daughter.
That's exactly what you need now.
I did a little research.
You feel tired?
"It's still sharp, isn't it? My feet are still sharp in the bottom." "It's pretty sharp beach, you're still reaching the bottom, right?"
I went to London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid not to lose your money?
It's cold, why don't you wear a cowboy?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Find me a glass.
I need more money.

Whenever I hear this song, Tom comes in my mind.
We did circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not a farmer.
I'm eating.
Your girlfriend is here.
I'm over thirty.
Do not put sugar in coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom is John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do this?

They're here.
Someone probably likes Tom.
Are you going to visit me?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the party.
As he hit the phone, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wears her best dress.
Tom is unresolved.
Tom can also speak French and English.
Tom predicted that Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an incognist.
He wants to learn how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato sauce...
I need you.
You all right?
This book belongs to Paul.
It doesn't seem to be Canadian Tom.
I don't understand French at all.

Who shot them?
I'm writing less and less these days.
Get it off.
It's a shame you couldn't come.
Write something.

Tom pushed his nose on the window.
You're smaller than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I arrived at 2:30.
You may be right.
Oxygen is necessary for burning.
All right? All right?
You're incredible.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thank you.
Only I can save you.
Where's an archipelago?
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom doesn't drive fast.
His current attitude confirms what we thought.
Tom told me he would like to repair Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
More.
Don't be so hard with your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You convinced me.
This is my daughter.
I talked to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm ashamed.
We're going to visit our friends.
I'm suffering from frequencies.
And talking about genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Same hired another career.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance to the toilet is very cruel.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given them to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget that night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not gonna reveal her secrets.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I get at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
She shot her.

He answered the question.
The problem is that you are not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two classes.
I would like to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page 10.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that I could move after violence.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If she's busy, I'll help you.
I have a wine.
We got first.
I'm smarter than he.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's going to leave tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run! Run!
Everyone started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're big enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a beautiful theory. The only disadvantage I think it's probably common in all philosophical theories. It's wrong.
Why don't I be surprised at that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good to keep secrets.
I'm so nervous now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of shit here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thinking.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike is the highest of three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Will Tom die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unreasonable.
I like Irish music.
Give me a cup.
What height do you have?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I'd have to drink tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has a long hair.
I'm deceased.
I know how Len's got it.
Thank you for coming, guys, I'll see you in the next lesson!
This is Tom's dog.
I know something is hiding.
Tom cut off his head.
I've always met her at the store.
Tom is trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm out.
Tell them how I'm going to do it.
Do you have your source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
Here's it?
Where did you find the key?
Could that be not right?
Tom does not endure hot and wet summers here, and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, get my phone tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please, tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's Italian, isn't it?
She gave me it.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of porn magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just returned from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you. Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful that you don't need meat.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as soon as he could get his legs.
I like fishing.
I don't like those sweets.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Yeah, yeah.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of manicures.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was very hungry.
When is your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I made it as if I was sleeping.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary is protective with strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is difficult.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom squeezed the door.
I'm staying here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk slower.
Put the book on the other.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it?
Tom married Canada.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Are you sending a message to them?
Can I borrow a cowboy?
We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You have to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom is shaking.
Don't cut off the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unhappy.
You're not a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom stayed.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Will Israel attack Iran?
I like laughing.
I washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating late will help you feel more vegetable.
I'm French.
We've forgotten that you don't like pizza.
Yesterday I got up early.
Tom helps Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you a new one?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not difficult for French.
Someone's shouting.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was castan.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Stephen died.
We can't stop you.
What language do you speak in Switzerland?
Help me lift him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
Here and how long are you a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before evening.
Are you drunk?
Trying to write a message.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
I miss my father.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never gone to Okinawa.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus route is not boring.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom knifed Mary.
At first, I couldn't understand it.
I'm talking about Esperanto.
California is boring.
I'm happy!
They are all Canadians.
You're not welcome.
She's a very beautiful girl.
It helps him.
Nothing is missing.
He started singing.
This is a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
He wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a hard day.
His mother speaks Italian.
I'll leave her a shower.
Where are the girls?
You won't be alone.
Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her taking it.
I like sports.
I've got money.

We have three children.
You're not a Japanese.
Tell him I'm ready.
Linda likes to eat chocolate.
He's trying.
Thomas hasn't arrived yet.
They say they are Canadians.
Put the towel and put the towel on the shelf.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tom and Sue have been known since 1985.
You're talking Chinese?
I have two native languages.
I'm not going to send you.
What's going on?
We heard the news that you passed the exams.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We are not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What the hell did I think?
Tell them I'm here.
I assumed you were a Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Is Tom running every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went to the church every Sunday.
Tell her we're ready.
Can I accompany you to the outer door?
He's still studying.
I don't want them.
Tom ran.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
She's younger than your sister.
When are your holidays starting?
Tom danced.
What did you say to them?
I've already talked to Tom about this.
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want to drink some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you use is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate the whole apple.
I'm not scared.
I'm scared.
It's different.
I just moved.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than that.
I want this TV.
She's tired.
In an hour we'll be over.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom turns the table, isn't he?
Tell them your theory.
I could find my problem if I did that.
Where is the Greek Embassy?
I'm your teacher.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?
Tom died in 2013.
I'm writing a letter to Mary.
Tom and Mary are in love.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?
The chairs will be here tomorrow.
Do you want some water?
Tell them.
As far as I know, Tom might be dead.
She's smart, isn't she?
Tom is always willing to help.
Thank you guys, I'll see you tomorrow!
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We are students.
Anyone knows Japanese?
Tom isn't smart.
He was born rich.
This is a flag.
Tom agreed distacticly.
I'm playing violin.
Collect your stuff and go.
You'll be surprised by what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green.
We gotta get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom was forced to go to school when he was a kid.
They took me off.
Only we can climb them.
I guess someone should like Tom.
It's always working very hard.
You destroyed him.
When did you come?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
I'm your friend?
I might admire other people, but I never tried to become someone else beyond myself.
I don't trust women.
I recommend reading this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most read book in the world?
In the evening, the iron collapses.
Is this book yours?
You're a lot smarter than me.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the goal.
My grandchildren cry very loudly.
Can you hire here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be ready.
What are you going to drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
He seemed to lie.
You won't like what I'm going to say.
When are you leaving?
What time does the store open?
I don't know French.
You destroyed him.
From your mouth and to God's ears!
You shot her.
They like you.
Water is not drinking.
That's eating the apple?
You're gonna make you stay here.
Tom is a year bigger than Mary.
We're all trying to help you.
The girl is beautiful.
I'll come with you.
Where's the money, Tom?
Where are you working?
They're actors.
Can you speak my language?
You're not going to Australia to build stores?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course, every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Turn right until you see the mail and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so hard.
Tom eats a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
It'll run.
You're ready.
We recognized her.
It's a diet.
You're sick, you need to rest.
Tom is obedient.
I underestimate him.
Are you really Canadians?
Suddenly, I started to weigh.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Ali's book.
It was my husband's idea.

I have ten styles.
I appreciate that.
Did you pay all the bills?
Did you buy flowers?

You told her.
Don't press the dog's wound.
Tom's angry with us.
I bought you red roses.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone call.

Not so many people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.

I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like it or not.
Forgiveing others is a act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.

I woke up and saw that my card was missing.
What did you eat?
I think I hear them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I visited Tom many times in Boston.
We have wine.
Did you tell them about us?

At first, I couldn't understand it.
They like the fruit in Tom.
That was my box.
She started singing.
He speaks French.
We all want the prices to fall.

Kiss me, Tom.
"Are you tired?" "No, no."
No one translates my suggestions!
I like the shells.

No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to be late.
Are you sure I don't want to talk to Tom about that?

He looks happy.
We've been prepared well.
Are you happy?
Tom's gonna forgive you.
You like to get me to sleep, right?
It's worth it?
He's a lot more brilliant.
They'll hear us.
I woke up early.
We're gonna have to wait.

They have potatoes in France but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.

Anything else?

Would you go to Boston next week?
You look happy today.

It was weird.
Nobody understands it.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red mushroom?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're bigger than that.
Let me make my position clearer.

To make my position clearer.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.

The thief turned into a police officer.
Can I get you out?

Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.

Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It makes my life a witness.
Tom gave me this sweat.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
I'm missing.
You were happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly stupid.
I'm not gonna wait for you.

What do you want?
We like the kids.

Do you speak Hebrew?
To whom did Tom sell his car?
You're very strange.
Come here right now.

Would you give me your little girl, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his deficiencies, but I like it.

Tom was busy.
I like laughing.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He fell asleep at 10am yesterday.
You haven't even told me who you are.
I have as many books as Tom.
I like this song.
You're a patient woman.
You're gonna be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.

Where did you go on the Sunday that took us?
Keep both hands on the chest.

Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
That's inconceivable.
No one came to see me in the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, although the smile takes only a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother is here.
Betty's been here last time.
He admitted it?
I think you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
The next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know many pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not scared.
Do you want that?
It's not yours.
It was yours.
The house is too large for us and beyond is very expensive.
Are you sure I'm Canada's only here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They smile.
"He kissed you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on the cover.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
You still stay in Park Street?
Close the door.
He's so young.

They trust him.
Are you a member of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There are books here.

I'm crazy!
I just did what Tom asked me.
Tom told us not to be afraid.

Two beers, please.

Close the door.
This event has pushed me.
Let me make my position clearer.

That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
No one knows how it works.
You look tired.

I refuse to accept this.
We all know you.
Drink some water.
I like cats in my dog.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom died in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's that?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
The food is good.
I'll accompany you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I can't see you.
She allowed me to see her daughter.
My house is close to school.
I assumed you were Canada.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to Canada.
I'll wait for you here at 2:30.
The rejection hurts.
I hope that will continue.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What did you say to them?
Come with me in Boston.
Do you swim often?
I was very angry with so many people to see me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom pulled his hair in black.
Yeah, I'm coming right now.
I took it for fun and didn't answer.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared me dinner.
My favorite color is orange.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
I'll wait for you at 2:30.

Is there bread?
Put him out.

I'm glad to see you again.
How can I find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago I had a teeth export.
You can take a taxi.
I rarely watch documentary.
Tom told Mary to sit down.
I can read English, but I can't talk about it.
I think I know why you're here.

By the voice the iron also.
He thought it was selfish.

Do you like driving fast cars?
Take my towel.
Be careful not to think about this rock.
When did you finish it?
Children like to drink fruit juice.
You will learn to speak Portuguese!
Tom has a good vision.
I didn't like Tom's idea.
What would he order in the restaurant? I was thinking about something in sushi.
They burned the paper.
Paper is easily burned.
I thought it was okay.
I wish I wasn't a Canadian.
I don't understand the music.
You're very strange.
Tom's writing slowly.

He ate dinner.
Bring them with you.

My cat is white.
What time is it now in London?
What else did you tell him?
Didn't you say you shouldn't close the door?
I can't remember any day Tom took a break.
Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What will they do?

It's an outlet.
Tell me what you want.
Do you like it?

Where did you go?
That's my table.

We want one.

You seem to be a flower.
You shot her.
We know you're hurting.

Luckily he didn't die in the accident.

It can't drive.
It was expected.
This polythrone is breathtaking.
Tell them you don't need him.
He likes the cardboard.
The strong must help the impossible.
I need a computer.
Tom looks tired.
Tell him I won't do that.

Tom ignored Mary.
When did you buy it?
Tell him to leave.
We want to create the smallest possible disturbance.
We were born the same day.
You're unresolved.
She promised me she would come.
It wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed so much.
When I first met her, she was near 30.

Come on! Come on!
I've never been to Paris.
She had a prisoner.
You're perfect.
Where's the money?

That's unfair.
I'm talking French.
Can I borrow your headphones?

Where are you working?
Nice costume.
Please come before 2:30.
I'm a man.

Someone has to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change the story, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom's got money.
Oh, shit!
It doesn't rain.
Tell them you're not ready.
What would you order at the restaurant? I thought about something in sushi.
