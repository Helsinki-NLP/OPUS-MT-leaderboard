Wells Assembly members are alarmed that they look like mute.
Part of the Members of the Assembly are considered to be proposed that their name be changed to "CUP" (deputy of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal has been provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the entire political spectrum fear that this may be a cause of laughter.
One of the labourists said that his group was disturbed because his new name was "Roman with Stupid and Doubt."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, this definitely has a cruel significance.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group "is not happy" and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party indicated that his group was "no prejudiced" to change the name, but notes that the new name of the CZK (MWP) has a certain verbal image with "muppet".
In this context, la letter W se pronounce similar to la letter U in anglais yorkshire.
La Commission de la Assemblea, which currently elaborates the black text of the bill to change the name, declare: "Comprehensiblemente, the definitive decision of all the description names called members of the Assemblea belongs to the same members".
The Wales Government Act of 2017 gave Wales Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, Commission publicated the results of public interrogation on the proposals and found wide support for the Assembly to begin to call it "Parlament of Wales".
Deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados
Members of the Assembly propose alternative alternatives, but the achievement of consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, from whom it is expected to submit the Black to the draft legislative amendement within a few weeks.
The draft legislative reforming will also include other changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly shall have final vote on how they shall be called when they reach the discussion of the bill.
"Macedonians will vote in referendum if they change the name of their country"
On Sunday, voters will vote if they will change their country name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens insisted long ago that the name of its northern neighbour represented a claim against Greece's territory, and it repeatedly opposed its attempts to join EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is opponent of a referendum on the change of the name of the country, has pronounced that you will not read the vote.
However, supporters of referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change in the name of the country is simply the price that must be paid for joining EU and NATO.
The Campaniles of St. Martin's in the background of the difficulties of the Churches in Harlem
"If we look at an historic plan, according to the old people I talked with, there was a bar and a church literally in every corner," says Adams.
“Today both of them disappeared.”
Adams tells us that the bars disappearing is understandable.
“Hore today is socialized in different ways,” adds.
"Bars er ikke de kvartalsdagen, hvor alle samles regelbundet."

The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks by apartments where people live who don't help survive the rest of the sanctuary of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of the people who buy houses in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the process of closing these churches, because it is particularly improbable that the majority of the new settlements will visit them.”
Both churches were constructed by white pastures, before Harlem became a neighborhood of the Blacks – Metropole Community in 1870, and St. Martin's decades later.
Initial white methodist patch was released in the 1930s after the 1930s.
After that, the building became owned by black residents of the neighborhood.
"Sv. Martin" was poetized by Black Christians under the leadership of Prepot John Howard Johnson, who organized boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they didn't want to hire blackworkers.
In 1939, the building tolerated severe fire damages, but Father Johnson's enoriases formed a plan for her restoration, where the cabins ordered.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson's father, and the heir of St. Martin, with pride call them the "poverty bands".
The expert, who used the chambers in July, has another description: "Cultural Treasure" and "Unreplaceable Historical Instrument".
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first system of cambins in the world that was used by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to the larger system in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather mentions that from St. Martin, they've not replaced him.
What has been played in St. Martin in the past few weeks was a complicated story by architects and artists, some led by world leaders of the church, some by Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal Episcopal.
De la vesteria, que es el principal organo de la pastia, consisting of the world leaders, wrote to the eparchy in July, expresando sus inquietuds de que la eparchia "bien tendría a transferir los costes de la vesteria", aunque el arcade no tuvo un papel en la contratación de arquitectos, arquitectos y editores.
Some enoriases have complained of lack of transparency by the eparhia.
13-year-old child has been injured by aqua when hunting omaris in California
Akkula has attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday last Saturday, while it has been a shark of omer in California on the first day of the hunting season, representative organs reported.
The attack occurred a little 7:00 ago, near Baikon Beach in Ensisinitas Beach.
Chad Hamle shared before KSWB-TV in San Diego that he's gone with friends about half an hour Saturday morning, when he's heard the boy crying for help, and he's gone in together with a whole group to take him out of the water.
Haml first thought that the child was a little worried and excited, and then realized how they shouted: "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
"Happy me!"
Hamle shared that when he came to the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key was broken.
Y añadió Hamal: "Estoy invitado a todo el mundo a salir de la fuente, porque hay un agujero."
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the pediatric hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was adopted in a critical condition.
It is still not known what kind of akkule is responsible for the attack.
The rescue captain Larry Gills has pronounced a media reporting that a few weeks earlier in the water had been detected a baccarat, but it was estimated that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles adds that the victim suffered traumatically traumatically damaged the upper part of her body.
The authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Kazablad to Suomi in Encitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is running.
Gilis notes that in the area there are more than 135 types of accules, but the majority of them are not a danger for people.
Sainsbury Plans Offensive in Britain Market for Decorative Products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening bunches for dekorative products in their facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant offensive in the UK market for decorative products, which is estimated at 2,8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while simultaneously the sales of fashion and household products decline, the largest stocks of decorative products so far will be placed in 11 stores throughout the country.
The investment in the decorative industry is done at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the freed space on the stars, recently used by TVs, microwave furniture and other household apparatus.
De Sainsbury, they have said they will double the number of decoration products offered up to 3000 products, including first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees's Bees' gambling products now will also get more space like the offers in Boots stores.
Supermarket also restarts its boutique gamma make-up, so the majority of products can be used by vegans – something that is more and more demanding from younger consumers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop Parfum Trader will experiment programs for discounts in two stores of Sainsbury, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be found in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Marketing online and moving focus on buying smaller amounts of food daily in convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury, shared that the objects will look more and more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain attempts to fight the Aldi and Lidl diskontries, offering more services and non-nutrition goods.
From Sainsbury, Argos has objects in hundreds of stores, and also open Habitats objects since they purchased both chains two years ago – which the company claims that it has increased sales of food products and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous experiment of the chain supermarkets to refascinate their objects for decorative and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury did experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about distributing profits from the pharmaceutical company's objects in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio objects, who owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds 3 years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan, providing a rich range of luxury brands care of skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury, affirmed: "We transformed the appearance and nature of our beautiful stamps to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training of our colleagues, which will offer professional advice on site.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every flavor and all that is needed in a sealing environment with a convenient location, making this combination us a attractive destination for decorative products, which challenges the concept itself of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "paradiso" after Holly Willey's refusal of the deal for 11 million pounds
The Dragons Star Den Peter Jones “have invaded” after television leader Holly Willey resigned from 11 million pounds deal with his liftable company to focus on their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willey doesn't have time for the brand houseware devices and accessories Truly.
The business of the couple is compared to the Goop brand of Guinette Полтроу.
The 37-year-old leader of “That morning” announced that she abandoned Instagram.
Holly Willey left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones "to kick" after downloading from their income business with the brand products for lifstail in the last minute - focusing on their own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources share that Jones "has "inspired" when the "golden girl" of the TV admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the center of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – worth up to 1,5 million pounds, mean Tru no longer have time for his branding home products and accessories.
The business is similar to the Goop brand of Guinnet Полтроу, with the rumors that it has doubled the wealth of Willeyby, whose value is predicted for 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willey announced on Instagram that Truly was leaving, Jones quitted Britain with a plane to go to one of his vacation property.
One of the sources shared this: "Truly definitivamente was Holly's top priority.
It was hoped that it would be a long-term commitment, which would provide its future in the next few decades.
Its decision was to leave all of them completely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
In the centre of Marlow, there is a warehouse that is full of expectatives to sell products."
Experts believe that withdrawal of the leading "This Morning", which is one of the most successful stars of Britain, could cost the company millions due to the enormous investment in products, ranging from candlesticks and candlesticks to clothing and home products, as well as can lead to a delay in marketing.
And not at last, it can also mean that at last is a long friendship.
Wileybi, who is a mother of three children, and Dan Bolduin is a close friend of Jones and his wife Tarra Cape for 10 years.
The Willowbi itself founded Truly together with Cape in 2016, while Jones, who is 52 years old, joined as president of the company in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, while Jones owns 40% of Bolduin's television producer company.
Wileyby will become M&S brand's Messenger and will also replace Ann McCarlin as leader of ITV's "I'm a celebrity" broadcast.
A source that's close to Jones last night made a statement: "We're not going to comment his business."
“True negotiations” resulting in “relations upgrade”
"Employed for criticisms, which reporting channels would bring a comment, which some would consider "inadequate for the president" and very positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump stop so much?
Trump responded to his jogging way “neutral.”
“I haven’t abandoned anything.”
He noted that Kim manifested interest in the second meeting, after the first took place in Singapore in June, and was declared by Trump "a major step towards the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations about the removal of this weapon are delayed.
More than three months after the meeting of Yunus in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yung Ho reported to representatives of the UN General Assembly that North Korea "is not seeing mutual relationship" by the United States towards the first steps of his country's first step on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the US continues with sanctions that aim to maintain tension.
Trump introduced in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relationships with North Korea are beautiful," he said.
"We were entrusted to war with this country.
Million people were killed.
“Now we are happy with wonderful relationships.”
The President said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results – stop tests with missiles, liberation of prisoners and returning home to the bodies of US soldiers.

"It's very easy to act as president, but instead of having 10 000 people out there who are trying to enter this prep zone, we would have about 200 people just there," Trump said, soociating the crowd before themselves.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and lead to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign non-governmental organizations, they were not required.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international assistance.
"Desfortunately, in many cases, se manifeste inadmissible opinion de que no international assistance is required, which makes things lightly challenged", affirmed Mrs Sumbung.

The National spokesman of the Agency for Disasters Mr. Sutopo announced that Indonesian authorities are currently evaluating the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies will allow them to contribute to the recovery efforts.
Considering the constant earthquake in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of catastrophe.
Although asylums were constructed in Achech in case of tsunami, they were not common viewed by the rest of the coasts.
The evidente absence of tsunami sirena warning in Palu probably has contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions transportation between the multitude of Indonesian islands is a challenge.
The natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Lately stationed in Lombok for the service of the sacrifices of the earthquake, a hospital ship has traveled to Palu, but it will last at least three days before he succeeded in reaching the location of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo transformed the improvement of Indonesia's restless infrastructure in the center of his predecessor campaign, investing a large amount of funds in roads and railways.

Mr. Joko is also situated under pressure, derived from persistent sectative tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim bands fight on the streets with cats, arrows and guns, as well as other original weapons.

Cromwell's Parliamentary Statue becomes the latest memory hit by "rewriting history"
Its prohibition will be a poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artefacts, which has been done by his fanatic puritan followers.
"Ala "Community of Cromwell" describe Mr. Crik's proposal as "intelligence" and "probation for rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this debate to remove statues that of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace to become a target.
Iconion of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Maybe Cromwell's wrong will be a victime because of the acts of Thomas' ancestor in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Hamo Tornicroft is a proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the historyography of a figure that many still consider as worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is monarchy.
Is this totally precise presentation is subject to continuous historical debate?
What's sure is the conflict in the mid-17th century, which has formed the successive development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognized person, which represents the one side of this separation.
"See's achievements as a lord protector deserven also confession and celebration."

More than 20 million people saw listening to Bret Kavanau
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating vision of the testimony of the Supreme Court nominated for Bret Kavanau and Christine Blaise Ford – the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which occurred in the 1980s of the 20th century.
During that time, the opposition politics continued, while the networks interrupted their regular rotation programs in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by senator Jeff Fleck of Arizona and that the FBI must conduct a weekly investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau had a drinking pressure and tried to take her clothes off during a high school cup.
Kavanau, in his emotions absent testimonial, is absolute categorized that something like that didn't happen.
"Nielsen's reported number of 20,4 million viewers may have seen a testimonial Friday.
The company has counted the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct available data for other networks that broadcast auditions, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.

For comparison, we talk about a public, similar to that of a championship football match or Hollywood Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose leading leaders strongly supported the designation of Cavanau, is the first among all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers in a day-to-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, 3,1 million, NBC – 2,94 million, MSNBC – 2,89 million, CNN – 2,52 million.
Interess remained high and after hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in Friday Drama.
After the office of a moderate republikan, a declaration that he would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras screamed Friday as protestants defended it while trying to capture a lift for meeting of the Court Commission.
During the whole turbulence in a few minutes so that you didn't lift eyes from the ground that was broadcast live by CNN.
"'Amen,'" replicó viuda, 'Amen,' "it's true. "
“Are you sure that he represented the truth in front of the state?

Fleck responded that he had already gone out of his office with a declaration and before the doors of the elevator's closure reported that he would pronounce it further during the hearing by the commission.
The Cable and Broadcasting Networks provided a live coating intensive a few hours later, when the Court of Justice had to decide whether to transfer Cavanau's nomination to the attention of the plenary Senate of voting.
"Ala Fleck has notified that he would do this only if he is sure that the FBI will review the accusations against the nominated next week, which the Democrats of the Opposition insist.
Fleck was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, senator of the Party of Democrats Chris Queens.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
His choice was definitely crucial, since it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered FBI to investigate the accusations against Kavanau.

Police in confrontation with catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the independence protesters confronted the gendarmerie, when thousands joined protests against protests to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarising vote for the departure of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to measure the peaceguards with eggs and paint powder, thus creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that normally smoke by tourists.
The next day, the police came up, and the police ran away to their prisoners to take Paul and Silas away.
“For hours, independence supporters cried: ‘We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,’ while the declarations for the conservation of the integrity of the country returned with ‘Spain forever’.
The local press reported that as a result of the protests 14 people received medical assistance for minor injuries.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the holding of the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but deprived by separatist-informed catalans.
The majority voted for independence, although the activity was low, since the majority of opponents of the resignation boicotteed referendum.
According to Katalonian authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year, after police attempted to stop voting in voting sections in the region with a number of furious conflicts.
Independence groups have spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of national police.
However, the demonstration was made, but it was forced to pass a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician, who joined a separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘
“I saw how my parents weep with joy when they were able to vote, and now it seems to be in a position,” he added.
Despite the noted important victory, either with little difference, in the regional elections last December, supporting the independence of Catalonia political parties experiencing difficulties this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in a self-taxed streaming, or are arrested in the expectation of a process lastly because of their role of the independence in organisation.
Hoan Piog, 42-year-old mechanik, who recorded protests in support of police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians of both sides.
His comments are "because he's been more and more arrogant".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested leader in Catalonia in expectation of a preliminare process last year, anoncéd a candidature for elections in the European Parliament next year.
“My candidature for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of the democratic values and the repressions we observed by the Government of Spain.”

Menga Gol takes Livingston's victory with 1-0 over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston ensures victory
The New Yorker in High League Livingston surprised Rangers and imposed only a second loss of Stephen Gerard in his first 18 matches as manager of the club at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's head became decisive, and Gary Holt's team was awarded to the second point in the Hebron classroom.
Gerard's team remains unwinnable in the High League this season, and next week, he knocks against Head Harts, from whom he left eight points in ranking.
But before that, Rangers is host of Rapid Vienna in Europe League Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston is already in a series of six matches without loss in the championship, and manager Holt still hasn't felt the taste of loss since Keni Miller's post change last month.
Livingston Lost Good Opportunities Against Non-Hidden Guests
Holt's team had to lead the result long before he scored gol, and his direct style of game was extremely complicated Rangers.
Scott Robinson tested defensiv, but his hit went through sides, then Alan Litgow shooted ahead of the cave, after Craig Halkett returned the ball with a head to him.
The homes allowed Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously complicate guests from static situations.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, like Declane Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and brought out a Menga, who led the ball and removed from midfield of penalty.
Until that time, Rangers ruled the ball more, but they were confronted with the improbable protection of the hosts, and the gateman Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This game style continued in the second half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers's Returner rescued Scott Pittman's foot shit, and Litlow's head struck through the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, the centers were laid, however, which were easily cleansed, and the judge did not respect the claims of the guests for the dump - first after the unification between Halkett and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then after the suspicion of a hand game.
“Fenomental” de Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, "Tony Macaroni Arena"
A phenomena game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays just super super, continuing to overcome expectations and improved performance.
The game style and the composition almost didn't suffer change after returning the team to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He's got real heroes in the field.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing defence in a superb way, while Menga constantly held Connor Goldson and Joe Warrel under tension.
At the same time, Rangers didn't show anything inspirational.
Under Gerard's leadership, they show some great things, but in this case, they were so much below these standards.
They missed their last paste before the naked, and only once they managed to break off the defense of the hosts – this loss must awaken Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the classroom.

The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.

Hundreds protestants protested against Erdogan, many of whom Kurdistans, also raised their voice, judging both the politics of Erdogan himself and the decision of the German government to allow him in the country.
Different protests reflect a break caused by a visitor, which is considered a hero by some German Turks and is simultaneously ignored as a depot by others.

Uragan Rose threatened with flash flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City (although the landscapes may benefit)
Arizona rarely occurs to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a great probability that exactly this will happen early next week, while the debilitating hurricane Rosa takes through the desert of the southwest, leading with her risk of flash floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already established posts against lightning floods in Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, in South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including in cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.

The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix noted in Twitter, “See 1950, only 10 cyclone tropical have maintained tropical storms within 200 km from Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was hurricane within 40 km from the border of Arizona.
The last models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches rain with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Pool, probably will get 1 to 2 inch rain, and in separate places are possible up to 4 inch convulsions.
For those who are not threatened by flashy floods, the Rose rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by the dry land.
although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain probably will be useful, as the southwestern part is currently in dry land.
According to the U.S. observation Commission for the dry periods little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive dryness, which is the second category of heavyweights," reports from weather.com.
First, the way of the uragan Rose leads to the dry land at the Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning still can be praised with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles/h, is located 385 miles from Puerto Eugene, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles/h.
The storm meets with colder water over Pacific and therefore weaken.

Rain above a part of Mexico can be strong and leads to a significant risk of upgrades.
"Submersible rainfall is expected from Baha California to Northwest Sonora, which is possible to 10 inches", reports from weather.com.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching Arizona border Tuesday early morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona South Utah until Tuesday late evening.
"The fundamental risk of Rose or its consequences is extreme strong rain in Bahra California, northern west of Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States", warns the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rain will lead to life-threatening lightning floods and carrying various waste flows in the desert, as well as lightning in the fields of the mountains.

The President of Mexico promised not to use military against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swerved that he would never use military force. This happened while the country approached the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
On Saturday of Tlatelolko Plaza, President Lopez Obradore promised "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The soldiers shooted against a peaceful demonstration on the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while the student movements from left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador gave a vow to support young Mexicans, providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The President also concluded that unemployment and absence of access to education attracts young people to bands criminals.
US must double financing for development of the IA
In the moment China becomes more and more active in front of development of artificial intelligence, USA must double its budget for research in this field, assert the researcher and developer of IE Kay Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was sent after different units of the US government made statements on the theme of the IA, although the US as a whole has no official strategy for the IA.
China presented its plan in the past year: the country seeks to become the number 1 of innovations in the IA by 2030.
"Duplication of budget for development of ISIS will be a good start because all other countries are far from the US and are planning to make next tests for ISIS", he said.
The duplication of financing may also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of ISIS coming from the USA, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of the IE: China: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s largest companies for IE – Face+++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon Lee, University of the Year, worked on the II System, which won the best-successful player in America, and was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Ley gives the debt of the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Robotic Robotics Race of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when will next be the next one, which will help to recognize new missionaries.
“Students in the United States often need to work well to gain financing from the government,” he said.
"China, not Academic Leaders, it takes corporations," he says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights that work on the IA.
Lee also claims that changes in the immigration policy can help the US to strengthen their IS program.
“I think doctors of III sciences should offer green cards automatically,” he says.
The US State Council announced its plan for developing artificial intelligence from next generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations finance researchers in the USA, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lie.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners in the industry and academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month DARPA reported a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF, now they investe over $100 million per year in the development of the IA.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislator who wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has noted any activity for months.
Makedonians vote in referendum if they change the name of their country
Citizens of Macedonia voted in referendum this week in order for the name of the country to change the name of "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked the membership of Macedonia in the EU and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it requires a veto for its integration into NATO and EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but the nationalist-oriented opponents argued that the change would undermine the identity etnic of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov, who said that he himself would not vote in a referendum, while simultaneously a campaign for his boycottation throws shadow into doubt whether the referendum would be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required for recognition of his validity.
The question of the bulletin states: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that his price is worth paying in order to achieve the entry of the former after the fall of Yugoslavia State Macedonia in organizations such as EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young Macedonians, for them to be able to live freely under the table of the European Union, because this means a life safeer for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Scopio.
Although the referendum does not have a force obligatory, adequate parlementarians say that they will complie with the result of it to a degree that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, there must be two-thirds votes of parliamentary representatives.
The State Election Committee notified that until 1 afternoon there were no reports of irregularities.
However, electoral activity was only 16%, compared to 34% during the last elections in 2016, when 66% of the voters registered visited urnes.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gayose Tanevski, 62-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, his wife Zooritsa, and their son Duško voted in a referendum in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country, which will discover the way of joining NATO and the European Union in the Streaming of 30 September 2018.
In Skopje's parliament Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of the tents, closed by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and EU, but we want to join them with proudly elevated heads, not through the gate of servants," he added.
"Kann unser land være fattig, men ändå har vi värd.
"''If they don't want us to come to Macedonia,''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''', ''we can''''.
The Prime Minister Zaev argued that NATO membership will lead to investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in Macedonia is more than 20%.
"I believe that the great majority will be with us, because 80 % of our citizens prefere EU and NATO", - he added.
The State also said that the positive result will lead to "a confirmation of the future of our people".
The Macedonian Institute for Political Studies (Institute for Political Studies) publicated the results of a study, according to which 30-43% of voters will participate in a referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, a work of Macedonia Television Telma, reported that 57% of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus 1 vote.
If the referendum failed, it would be the first serious attack against the pro-western government's policy since it won power in May last year.

Afterwards, he went to Sterling.
The English attacker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with a hit with his right leg, overcame Brayton Matthew Ryan's gateway and found the right angle of his neck.
"Aguaero fights some confusions in his feet," aldus City Pep Guardillola's manager.
“We planaged him to play about 55-60 minutes.
"See what is happening."
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
But Sterling was the one who gave the initial advance of the "Century" in this match from the High League of England.
He's been recorded in 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguero... ..has ..hacked deep in Brayton's half.

Shercer wants to play determine the fate of Rockies
After Nationals didn't classify themselves for playoffs, there was no special significance for another match of a title starter pitcher.
And yet always ambitious Shercer hopes to be titled Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant for Rockies, which leads a match against Los Angeles Dodgers in ranking NL West.
Rockies guaranteed their participation in at least a Wild Card match after victory with 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but still not sure that they will win their first title in division.
"Although we ourselves aren't fighting for nothing, we want to finish a season with a nice match in Denver, where the public and the other team will give everything they can to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
“Why would I miss such a match?”
Nationals still haven't announced a startup pizza Sunday, but it's assumed that they'll allow Shercer to participate if the match is decisive.
For Shercer this would be the 34th match as a start-up pizzar this year, as he conducted training on Thursday and would have normal time to break until Sunday.
Washington's right-hand pitcher thrower has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 straycoat in 220 2/3 innga during this season.

Leberists are no longer widespread.
“Partium is not tolerable to those who speak openly,
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censorize me, fewer were surprised.
In the end, I am just the last parliamentary member of the laborists, to whom it was stated that it wasn't welcome - just because I am sincerely speaking.
My college in parliament Joan Ryan received a similar attitude as he strongly opposed antisemitism.
In my case, censorship criticises me for my discord with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of the responsible economic policy, the national security, Europe, themes that are ironically similar to those with whom Jeremy expressed disagreement during the time of previous leaders.
In a statement about the labourers' meeting at Nottingham East on Friday, it was said that "we wanted the meetings to include all the people and be beneficial".
In my 8 years as a local representative of the labourists in Parliament, the meetings of Fridays were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today's tone of the majority of meetings and promises for "lighter and transcendental" politics have long been forgotten, if they've ever been on the agenda at all.
It was becoming increasingly evident that the different opinions are not tolerated in the labourist party and that every opinion is evaluated based on how much it likes the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, while the colleagues I worked before I thought they shared similar political opinions started expecting from me to make a reverse turning and to take positions with which I would never agree – whether on national security or on the unified market of the EU.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
In the interests of truth, I know that I even gained more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments about me are at least of political nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and targetedness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist rebellions every day without fearing them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that laborists must defeat a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widespread, and in every sign of infidelity or change of the rules of choice, it becomes increasingly tender.
"After 2 years, I have received abundance of advices that I wouldn't say anything, and then 'all will be okay.'"
That's not why I went into politics.
Since 32 years ago I joined the laborists as a student provoked by the Government of Tacher, which through ignorance resulted in literal degradation of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who need them the most – both as a consultant local or as a minister.
I've never seen my political opinions, including during the last elections.
Nottingham East, nobody could be confused in any way from my political position and my contradiction with the current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who supported the proposal on Friday that, when the state climb to Brexit, it will harm households, corporations, and the public sector, and I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy loyal to the leader of the labourists.
But real my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are members of the labourists, or no: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of revocation or political deviation will reject me to act in the way I think best in defending your interests.

ER 38-17 Melrose: ER's Unwinners Lead to Classification
The two late sets may also change the final result lightly, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to win in this incredibly interesting match from the High League of Tennent.
The team is head of the classified team, and the only one out of 10 teams is no loss to date.
Better defense and better use of opportunities were decisive in the match, from which Peter Murchi coach and his team can be much satisfied.
"I'm happy because other teams have tested a lot of duty to the last matches, and yet we're still without loss," Morchie said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "Greetings for Er, they really benefited from their positions better than us."
Grant Anderson's episode in the 14th minute, followed by a successive additional hit of Frazier Clima, led Ear forward to the result, but yellow card for Scotland national Rory Hughes, freed to play a match by Warreners, allowed Melrose to strike the result, after that it was after the reality of Jason Basketball.
Climamo increases the front for Erer from a penal hit just before the semi-time, noting the end after the salt action, and then realizing the additional hit, making 17-5 result for Erer at the break.
But Melrose started the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's axe, followed by a successful additional hit of Baggot, cut the front of just five points.
Following a long stop of the game due to the severe contusion of Ruarid Noth, which was thrown out on the knife, and after the replay of the Eer match, they increased their advances after Staford McDowell and successful additional hit of Climate.
Afterwards, Ear Blair McFerson's acting captain received a yellow cardboard and Melrose once again benefited from their number of advantages, demonstrating a strong pressure and realizing this through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed extra hit.
However, their hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card after breaking Clima without a ball, from the subsequent penal game Macferson realized a thing using the advanced line of offensive Ear.

Still Game Star seems to have been directed towards a new career in restaurant business
The Star of Still Game Ford Kirnan seems to have been directed towards a more direct and warm industry, after it was discovered that it was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, at which he is also a scenarist and one of the two stars along with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The two of them announced that the next nine season will be the last for the show, and it appears that Kirnan already plans his life after Craiglang.
According to official registers, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor is opposed to comment, although a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan planned to participate in the "progressive restaurant business business" of Glasgow.
"Sea is our": Bolivia hopes that the boat will open again the way to the Pacific
The marines constantly patroular the oceans with a la Paz sea stack.
Over the public buildings, there is a blue ocean flag.
The bases of the sea from Titica to the sea to the Amazones are adorned with the motto: “Our sea belongs to us.
"Our duty is to bring it back."
In Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost outlet, transmitted to Chile after bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive, as well as the invitation to float again from the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest since decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years already passed.
"Power is in Bolivia, wherever you feel wisdom and unity, where the country expects a positive result", said Bolivia diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla.
Many Bolivians will look at the condemnation of the international court on a big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will support Bolivia's desire and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is going to go to the contested battle for reelection next year, has also put a lot and a lot on the judgement of the court Monday.
“We are very close to that we can return access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court to make a decision in favor of Bolivia is pretty little. Yet, even if it judges in favor of it, it wouldn't change things in reality.
The United Nations Authority located in the Netherlands has no power to take the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.

And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may actually have been injured.
"Problems of access to the oceans were devastated by the current government of Bolivia", he added.
Afterwards, we found out that Morales's military rhetoric was similar, and that the little remained good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations in a moment, but it will be extremely difficult after normal dialogue.
The two parties have not supported diplomatic missions from 1962.
Ex-president Edward Rodriguez Weltse, representative of Bolivia in Haga, rejected the idea that the decision of the court is taken extraordinarily fast.
Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile", as well as the chance to "turn 139 years of disagreement by gaining profits for both sides".
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales, who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, has used the problem of access to the ocean as a "political patriotism".
"Bolivia never will abandone its right to come out into the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Decision is the opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue with nuclear disarmament until it can trust USA
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong Ho says that his country will never reach nuclear weapons first if he is unable to trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
"U.S." "He invited the United States to keep the promises that they had given during the meeting between leaders of opposition countries in Singapore."
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the edge to restart the non-original diplomacy on nuclear issue more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri calls "unclear hope" the idea that continuation of US sanctions and protests on a declaration that would end the Korean War, would cause North to fall on the knees.
Washington is inclined to agree with the Declaration, without Phenyang first to make a significant geste on the path of the weaponry.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
There is a widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious for their rejection of the arsenal, which they consider as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan in the next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.

John Edward: Language skills are vital for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain reputation for academic distinction, as it continues in 2018 with another excellent performance of experimental results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Independent School Association (SCIS), strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen by them, and their place in a global world.
As a sector educational, which can compile and implemente personal educational program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela dice: "Si tú hablas con alguien para entender el idioma de quien, entonces tus palabras saldrán accede a él.
when, when when, when, when, when, when, when, when, when, when, when,, when, when, when, when in in in in his his his his his his his, thou thou thou, thou thou thou thou thou, thou thou thou thou
This is a powerful reminder that we can't count only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year's tests, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
In total, 68% of the students who studied foreign languages achieved high rating A.
Data collected from 74 members of SCIS schools show that 72% of the students achieved A rating in Chinese, while the same estimation has 72% of the German scholars studying, 69% of the French schools and 63% of the Spanish scholars.
Esto demuestra que las escuelas independientes de Scotland perciben idiomas extranjeros como abilitaciones vitales, de las cuales los niños y los jóvenes definitivamente necesitan un futuro.
Currently, languages as subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond them.
In 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Work Skills of the United Kingdom Research, a study of 2014 by the Commission for Employment and Work Skills of the United Kingdom found that the employer's difficulty find employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competence.
“Entonces, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja, deja.
More and more work positions require governance of foreign language, which makes these skills essentials in a globalized world.
Y no hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay hay
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically place the dominante multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to YouGov’s study of more than 4000 adults UK citizens in 2013, 75% of them weren’t possessive of foreign languages enough to speak language, since French was the only language whose ownership was the dual-digital percentage of 15%.
So investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Governing several languages, particularly those of the economies that are developing, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will vary different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in the future plan for 2020, e.g. Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be enough languages to choose from independent schools, as teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed in life, regardless of what hides the future.
It is inevitably impossible now to negate that in a global business environment, languages continues to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires that this be taken into account in the system of education.
In fact, modern languages must be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Dee, dee, dee.

Trump Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of Trump, including stops in famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmation vote for his election to fill the free place in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the future elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened by the loss of control over Congress during the votes in November.
In what hours will Trump meet in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's Visit to Willing, West Virginia is planned for 19:00, East Time this evening, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's visit in West Virginia, below via live broadcasting in YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider the hearings of this week for the Supreme Court nominated by Bret Cavano, where there was a tension due to claims of immoral sexual acts, which kept Senate's vote confirming up to a week while FBI investigated.
However, the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans gather inertia for the elections in November.
Hence, President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five meetings in the next week aim to “activate volunteers and supporters, as Republicans try to defend and expand their majority in Senate and Chamber of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
"Control on Congress is so important for his program that the president will visit as many states as possible, and we start a campaign season full of commitments," he said, a spokesman of Trump, who refused to mention it.
The meeting of Wesbanco Arena in Wales, planned tonight, could lead supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and attracte attention to the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s second visit will take place Saturday for this month in West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisie, who left in sociological studies.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisy the fact that the president has come to give him anxiety in sociological studies," said Simon Heather, politologue from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
"Raider Cup" 2018: US Team will fight until last, keeping hopes alive before singles Sunday
After three sessions without intrigue forursum matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Raider Cup needed.
Change the advantage in sport is a pretty subjective concept, however, where players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like this.
So, who team is in the best position right now?
"They were six points, and now only four, so I guess we've got a little inertia," said Jordan Spicet at the end of today's race day.
"Obviously, Europa has 4 points plus 4 points plus 12 plus distribution only.
However, as Spice says, Americans still have something to show, and their fans shouldn't lose hope, if we should judge the sport form of Spice and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three of four possible points.
Spit shows excellent form from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The admonition of the fans became increasingly stronger, while he walked forward in a round, where he scored a precise hit in the fourth match, after he and Thomas left two hits after the first two holes.
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
said: ", “It important that you not think think no other anything other and and you Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo Fo on your own own own match in yourself yourself yourself match match,"," said said said said, " " " " ", it it not think no no other other other,"," " ", " " ", it it,"," " """""" " " ", " important," not think no no no other other other, and and and and and
All this is the beginning of these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spider-Man and Thomas in the last two days are Franchesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncontroversial characters of the Ryder Cup.
"Un strange, but fascinating couple from Europe, won four of four, and it seems to have all come up with them.
"Moliwood was the only couple who didn't make gods on Sunday afternoon, but they didn't make gods on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, or Friday morning.
These successes consecutives, as well as the way between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are players who will win Sunday and there will be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe.
For preferred both at the same time different holes.
However, the stories of the European glorious were a little premature.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly complied with Sergio García, the hero of the Fuerbol matches from the morning while he partnered with Alex Noren.
"Bogi" and two "Tabla" in the first nine holes brought Spanish and Swedish into troubles, which they couldn't handle.
In the matches of the week, nobody else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "Foursom" matches are extremly interesting to watch closely because of the interaktion between couples, the tips that exchange each other, and how a strategy can endure change in any moment.
The Europeans played better in a team, and this is why they accumulated a significant front before the last day, but this session of the "Forssom" matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something in which many people, especially in the United States, doubted strongly.
Europe leads 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europa will have a solid front before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading US with 10-6 after playing matches of the formats "foourball" and "fooursom" on Saturday.
Inspirant duet Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinari started with two wins against the inviolable Tiger Woods, with their assets of the Le Golf National competition grew up by four points.
In tent de repatriation of the trofee, which lost on Hazeltine, 2 years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European Team dominated in the "foourball" matches of tomorrow over Americans who made error after error, and ultimately Europe won the series 3–1 wins.
"The United States had more opposition in the "Forursum" matches, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points of the 12 matches in the synagogue Sunday to keep a trophie.
Flitwood is the first newborn in Europe to win four points in order, and he and Molinari, known as Mollywood, after this sensational weekend, became only the second pair, won four points of his first four matches in the history of Raider Coupe.
After Woods and Patrick Ridge in the "foourball" matches, they were incredibly motivated to win the broken Woods and American newborn Brayson Decambu with an even more category score 5&4.
Woods, who just passed through his two matches on Saturday, only demonstrated from time to time brilliance of his geniality, but to the moment there are 19 losses of 29 matches in "Fourball" and "Foursom" matches, as well as 7 losses consecutives.
Justin Rose, who received a break for the morning football matches, partnered with Henryk Stanson in the "Forssom" matches in the victory with 2&1 over Justin Johnson and Brooks Copca – equivalent to number one and number three in the world.
However, Europe's team couldn't enjoy a totally pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Speit and Justin Thomas, three-time winners, regagnated hopes of Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Pauler in the football matches, and later returned to win Pauler and Rory Mcilroy with 4&3 in the forum matches, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Raider Cup" it has happened a team to nack four points of deficiency before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furrick's team will keep the trophy even in equality.
But after two days, it seems that their chances of turning on Sundays are not very big.
North Korea says "no way" to disarma itself unilaterally, without trust
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the UN on Saturday that the continue sanctions deepen the deficiency of the United States and there is no way for the country to abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Annual General Meeting of the World Organization, Ri Jong-Hou, said that "important measures of good will have been taken in the last year", e.g. stop nuclear testing and missile testing, destruction of nuclear testing facility and promises not to distribute nuclear weapons and technologies.
"Indeed, we don't see a correspondente reacción by US", he said.
"Without trust in USA, we will not trust in our own national security, and under no circumstances there is no way of first arming one-sided."
"As R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R. R.

Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between President of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for “Korean peninsula nuclear disarmament” and Trump gave security for North Korean security.
North Korea seeks to official end of the Korea War of 1950-1953, but from the US say that Phenyan must first abandon his nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for abolition of stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insiste on first removing nuclear weapons" and increase the pressure by sanctions, to achieve their goal by force, and even oppose the "deklaration of end of war"," he said.
"Everything that sanctions can cause us to fall in the roots is a dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continue sanctions are deepening our infidelity."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed in the UN earlier than a week before.
"Instead, the minister has insisted on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moun Je-In in the past five months," he added, "if the country of question of nuclear arms was South Korea, no US, the elimination of nuclear weapons of Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a margin.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the orientation of North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States is inevitable, after Trump called Kim "man-raket" of a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction" last year, praised Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but said that there is still much work and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
“Everything: ‘Everything’ is ‘Everything’: ‘Everything’ is ‘Everything’: ‘Everything’ is ‘Everything’: ‘Everything’ is ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’ ‘Everything’
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council must reward Phenian for the measures taken.
Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of the United States, told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The execution of sanctions of the Security Council must necessarily continue until complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and the Phhenyan ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri in the meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Phenyan again in the next month to prepare the second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.

According to him, Kim told him that "associated measures" which he seeks are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wants to normalize his relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard Course for a sufficient break
New course at Harvard University this year causes all students to sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture to learn "the whole night" using caffeine.
The Teacher found that students in the university number one in the world often not even think about when it comes to the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he deemed to be the first of his kind in the USA.
Inspired to start the course, after talking about the impact of sleep loss on learning.
Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo Jo
"She said that no one ever told her about the importance of a dream that surprised me," she said.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the most essential about how good sleep habits help academic and sport achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of Health Services University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from serious sleep deficiency throughout the week.
One-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a lounge where the students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light how sport achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleep sleep routine.
In another part of participants is reported how long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, infarct, depression and cancer.
After this, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the impact on health of choice to smoke,” prof. Keisler.
The culture of pride of "learn all night" still exists, he says, and added that modern technologies and the constantly increasing pressure on students mean that sleep loss is a growing problem.
Assurance of enough and high quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of students in combating stress, fatigue, and anxiety," he says – even in order to avoid fulfilment, as deprivation of sleep brings the brain into a mode of hunger, making them constantly hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who teaches Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Caser in preparing the course, taking one of his classes during his first year in Harvard.
He says that his course "open the eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
Hopefully the next step is that all graduate students are asked to graduate such a curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kaisler recommends that the students consider whether they configure a alarm for sleep and awakening and know the adverse effects of "blue light" transmitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disturb the circle rhythm and cause problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Gol of Menga Broke Team of Gerard
Rangers suffered another loss, after Dolly Menga's joke broke Stephen Gerard's unfair team and brought a victory with 1–0 for Livingston.
The team of Ibrox wanted to write his first victory as a guest from the triomphe in February with 4-1 over Saint Johnson, but Gary Holt team only defeated Gerard's second defeat in his 18s matches as manager, which left his team with eights scores less delayed La defeat at the Vids library of the Harn.
Menga noted 7 minutes before the rest, and the one who was deprived of the Rangers team's constructive ideas in a moment wasn't close to the equation.
After the match, Rangers went to sixth place, and Livingston was already third, leaving the second Hebronian just a difference.
For Rangers may also have additional problems, as lateral judge Callam Spence got wound on his head, after being hit with a object that obviously was thrown by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that defeated Er in the semifinals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, rushed with Livingston's same single-sector, who rushed down against Harts last week, and should be content with the way that his aggressive team pared all the action of the enemy.
Rangers could dominate the ball's possession, but Livingston managed better in rare cases when they possessed it.
"They should have to take note in the second minute, when Menga brought Scott Pitman to the gateway Alan McGreeger, but the semi-protector lost the good opportunity.
Later centrifuge Kaygan Jacobs from faul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defence Alan Litgou detonated the ball off the backside.
Rangers went to control the game, but they failed to create nothing containing in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitivamente thought that there should be a dump in the 15th minute when he encountered Stephen Lawless, but Stephen Thomson's referral rejected Colombian's claims.
Rangers had only two precise shots in the first half of the time, but the former gateman of Ibrox Liam Kelly managed easily with a shot with Lassana Kuliballi's head and a weak shot of Ovie Ajaria.
Although Libya's fall in 34th minute was surprising in view of the ball's possession, it was totally worth it.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep centering.

Gerard responded a pause, cambiing Culibally with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing gave Morellos, but the impressive Kelly came out firmly and blocked the attack.

Anniversary: The inventor of the GIGER Counter
Page of our annual Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and BROEN... the day of birth of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Gaiger in Germany.
Gayger develops a method of saturation and measurement of radioactivity, an invention, which ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a Gayger Counter.
A stone of graggle in science from then on, the graggle counter has also become a stone of the pop culture, when in 1950 the film "The Campanes of the Coronado", in which apparently participated the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released in 1950.
Man: "Watch for God is this.
Rogers: This is a haiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
"When you put these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I am sure of it right now!"
Hans Gaiger died 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.

New Cancer Vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can traine immune system to "see" aliens cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches immunosystem to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells from patient and transforming them into laboratory
Then they can "see" protein, which is common for many types of cancers, and re-injectioned in the patient
The test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different cancer diseases.
A woman treated with a vaccine that trained the immune system to detect foreign cells saw how her ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes extraction of immune cells from the patient and transformation of them in laboratory, so that they can "se" protein, common for many types of cancer called HER2, and then injected again in the patient.
Professor J. Berzofsky, of the National Oncology Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that we have a lot promising vaccine."
HER2 "stimulates growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungas and colorrectal carcinoma, explained prof. Berzofsky.
Similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "education" how to address cancer cells, was used in the treatment of type leukemia.
Kenny West put a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with the title "Let's make America Great Again" when we participate in SNL.
I'm not going well
Kenny West was kidnapped in the studio during Saturday Night Live, after doing an insignificant performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and stated that he would candidate for president in 2020.
After completing his third song for the night called Ghost Town, during which he weared a hat titled "Let's make America Great Again", he declared himself against democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"I am often talking with whites and they ask me: "How can you like Trump?"
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
SNL started the show with the participation of Matthew Damon, in which the Hollywood star played the testimonies of Bret Kavana in front of the Senate Legal Committee for complaints of sexual rape made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's performance record was uploaded to social networks by Chris Rock's comedy.
It's not clear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
West complained in front of the auditorium that he had problems behind the towers because of his hat.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
They said to me, 'Don't go out of this shoe.'
Bless me!
And then they claim that I am on a shipping ship,” he said according to Washington Examiner.

"True with love."
The comments provoked at least twice lighting by the audience, and members of the SNL team seemed ashamed, said Variety, one of them told: "The whole studio closed."
West was invited last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Weast is a lot of fun with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle "Perie".
West received support from the TPUSA Conservative Group leader, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU, THANK YOU QUE TE HAVE APPROVED AT TEMPORATE."
However, Karen Hunter, leader of the show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was herself and that's great."
“But I choose not to reward a person (when I buy music, or his clothes, or support his “art”), for whom I think he welcomes and spreads a ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name and now "is officially known as Kenny West."

HIV/Spin: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China reported a 14% crash of the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 have been reported about 40.000 new cases.
The majority of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which notes change in comparison with the past.
Traditional HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, said the Chinese health services at a conference in the province of Jonah.

Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the communities of CGBT has been widespread.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with men were married to women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are as a result of incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, China's Government promised to give universal access to HIV medicines as part of the efforts to address this problem.
Maxin Waters negava, attributional, datations of senators from the Republican Party, "Dangerous Lies" and "Theories of Conspiracy"
The U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Walters condemned the accusations that a member of her team has posted personal information to three senators of three U.S. senators from Republicans of the Republicans of the U.S. House of Representatives page of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that the claims were made by experts and websites of the "ultra right wings".
"Løgn, løgn, and other depraved løgn", said Walters in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of the US senators Lindsay Gram from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Utah.

Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications is linked to the Walters Office, and released information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
"Este argumentation irrelevant is totally irrelevant and absolute falsehood", insisted Walters.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the expiration of this information.
This irrevocable claim is totally false and is absolute falsehood."
Waters' statement quickly provoked criticism online, including the former pressector of the White House, Ari Fleicher.
"Det finns en gift i den fornektelsen", skriver Fleicher.
"That supposed, she hasn't had a temperament suitable for a member of Congress.

"He must be quiet and balanced."
Flasher compared Walters' reaction with the criticism of the democrats of the judge Cavanato, who was accused by the critics that he also seemed angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, candidate from Republicans for the location of Walters in the interim elections, also stated his opinion on Twitter.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Walters claimed in his statement that her office had taken the right authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the agents will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be subjected to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
John’s Revyu of “Johnny England Is Exploding Again” – the weak spion parodie with Rowen Atkinson
It is traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new film with British participation and it appears that this also applies to the renaissance of the Exxon Comedy, espionage franchise for Johnny Ingliss – which started in 2003 with Johnny Ingliss and returned in 2011 with Johnny Ingliss Returns.
"Are the selfishness and mymycs that say how obviously we are stupid, going to become a new opportunity for a nation to move?"
In any case, Johnny Inglish, unkompetent, with eyes rooted and "cute" face, has permision to repeat things for a second time - his name is of great importance when it comes to a great comic creation designed for fans of cinemas who don't speak English.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent, who, in spite of his strange claims for a brilliant brilliant, possesses a little Kluzo, a little Mr. Ben, and a lot of the man, who contributed to a note of the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the London Olympics in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the abandoning chaos behind him a traveller and international man that Atkinson played in the already forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard.
In the last film with Johnny England, there's or two good moments.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter, carrying a middle-aged armor, and shortly the cords were knitted in his shirt.
Atkinson's contribution to the physical comedy is evident, but humor is pretty weak and strangely excessive, particularly when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include dosage comedy.
The humor looks more targeted to children rather than adults, and Johnny Inglish's crashes, I think, aren't innovative and focused, as the game of Actinson's no play resembles Mr. Ben.
The current assumption is always that Britain has faced serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hackled a British super secret network of spys and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the debut agent – unfortunately, a little role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister who is inundated and devastated figure and already suffered by a full break of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives all of its own for this quazzy-Tressa-Mei role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must call a retired agent, since all agents acting are compromised.
I mean, that's the same Johnny Ingliss, who currently works as a teacher in a boss center, who, however, is illegally teaching lessons how to be an agent undercover: here's some good falls when Ingliss recreate a rock rock academia spion.
English has been called to Whitehall for a quick instruction and resumed with his ex-aid Bo, a long-time assistant, played again by Ben Miller.
For a man is a family member, a wife of a commander of a bark, a role of joy, in which a little of the talents of Vicky Pepperdin have been scattered.
So, Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of the big secret services of His Majesty and to confront the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister falls under the danger of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims that he can solve British computer problems: the miserable Jason Walt, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey from the fars: dressed as a servitude, burn a French restaurant; create chaos when they move to the luxury yacht of Walt; and English provoke real anarchy when it tries to use a shade for virtual reality.
All mixtures are surely taken from the previous film, but since so nice and busty, there's much more content for children here.
A lot of indirect products.
As with other films about Johnny England, I continue to think: "Can the British film industry give Atkinson a role that corresponds to his talent?"
"Leyberists denied that British plans to work four days a week, but to receive a pay for five."
Jeremy Corbyn's Leaberist Party is thinking about a radical plan that the British should work four weeks, but get a pay for five.
The Party claims that it wants the leaders of the companies to provide the economies made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to the workers, giving them another day of rest.

Sources say that the idea would "injure" the economic program and the plans of the party to deploy the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
The Sunday Times (The Sunday Times) said: “See, it is expected that before the end of the year it will be notified for a review of politics.
"Not immediately, but the four-day working week is an ambition that coincide with the approach to rebalance of the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Liberal Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its overall predecessor campaign in 2017.
No, in this momentum, this ambition is not the approval of the whole Labour Party.
The labourist spokesman said, "The four-day week of work is not in the political party's, I'm not thinking about it."
John McDonald's Chancellor in Shadow uses the Labourers Conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonald's said that he was deciduous to take the power back from "involuntary directors" and "specialists" in the corporations of municipal services.
The Plans of Cancer in Shadow also mean that actual owners of shares in water supply companies may not be able to get their entire shares, since the Government of Laboratory may be able to impose "reserve" due to the infractions established.
In addition, he confirmed the plans of introducing workers into the boards of companies and creating private funds to transfer 10% of the net capital of private companies to employees who can accumulate dividend annually up to 500 pounds.

The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Bret Kavanano delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the office could cause some senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.

What is the festival "Global Citizen" and does it contribute to reducing poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which has an impressive composite of artists and performs an even impressive mission: elimination of poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather dozens of thousands of people on the big mountains in Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi Bi and Sean Mendes, but also familiarize themselves with the real goal of the event – elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which initiated in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, a international group of protections, which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as voluntary participation, sending no e-mails to a world leader, calling by phone, or link in another way in order to help them upgrade the target about the excuse
But how successful is "Global Citizen" 12 years before he achieved his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genial way to be convinced that they need action or is just another case of so-called “cliquity” – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
“Global Citizen” (Global Citizen) has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by their supporters, who insiste on a variety of purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped the leaders of the world to declare commitments and policies, equivalent to $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In the beginning of 2018, the group cite 390 engagements and messages resultant from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The Group believes that the insured funds have already impacted direct 649 million people in the world.
"The Power of Nutrition", established in UK Partnership between investors and performers, engaged in "assistent children to develop their full potential" which promises to give Ruanda $ 35 million, to assiste Twitter in order to stop the non-nutrition in the country", "700 civics after receiving more than 4 civics"
"With the support of the Government of Britain, donors, governments nationales, and citizens of the world like you, we can transforme social injustice of inalienable food simply into a historic note," said Ambassador of the Power of Food, Tracy Ulman in front of a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, calling Britain to improve feeding mothers and children, the government has reported financing a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of CSVs on his website, he asked: "Why do you think we can stop the extreme poverty?"
"Global Citizen" responde: "This will be a long and difficult path; sometimes we will fail and again we will fail."
But as with the great movement for civil rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bi, Janel Mona, are just some of the artists of this year's event in New York, to which leads will be Deborah-Ley Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
US can use marine forces to "bloque" and prevent exports of energy - Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, escape to its marine forces to prevent the entrance of Russian energy products to the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister Ryan Zink, according to Washington Examiner.
Zink argued that Russia's engagement in Syria, particularly where it acts on invitation to the legitime government, is a pretext for the study of new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just as they did in East and South Europe,” he said.
According to the Officer, there are ways and means to handle this.
"United States can, through our marine forces, ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them, to ensure that energy products are not enough to reach the market", he said.
Zink is referring to the present events organised by Consumer Energy Alliance, a group of non-profit goals, represented as the "voice of energy consumers" in the USA.
"He wanted to compare Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, observing that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulation and replacement of fuel", he said, definishing Russia as "ponnies with one number", with a economy dependent of excavable fuels.
The declarations come when the administration of Trump has the task of strengthening exports of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, officials in Trump’s administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” pipeline project “North Flow 2”, which according to Trump transformed Berlin into a “logger”.
Moscow stressed several times that the pipeline for $11 billion of North Stream 2, which will double existing capacity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is pure economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's flammable contradiction of the project was produced simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers must be able to choose the suppliers," said Alexander Novak, minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), urged the USA not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third party is engaged in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industry Federation (BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" of the 2020 presidency candidature, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Masachuzettes, said on Saturday, "it would consider seriously" the candidature to presidency after the interim elections.
During a City Council in Holocaust, Masachuzettes Warren confirmed that he was thinking of applying.
"It's time in Washington to enter women and repair our ruined government and this includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"Después 6 November, i'll take serious attention to the candidature to president."
Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump during the City Council, saying that he "leads this country in the wrong direction."
"I am concerned about the bottom of my soul like Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was offended in his criticism to Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court Bret Cavanato.
In a tweet post on Friday, Warren said: "We must have a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday demonstrated that the majority of voters of Warren's own don't think it should be candidated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Masachusetts said that the senator shouldn't candidate, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe's study.
30% of them supported this candidature.
The sociologic study showed more support for candidature to former governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent for and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party discussed about potential candidature in 2020 include ex Vicepresident Joe Baden and the Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would make an official decision in January, said Associated Press.

18 state and District of Colombia support the controversy of the new asylum policy
The 18 states and the District of Colombia support the judicial controversy of a new US policy, which rejects the asylum of victims of gangster and domestic violence.
"Representatives from 18 states and districts deputés in Washington for a good will in support of asylum seekers and disputed politics, according to NBC News.
It is not revealed the entire name of the prosecutor in the case "Grees vs Sessions", which the American Union for Civil Liberties filed against the federal policy in August.
She said that her partner "y sons of the cruel members of his band" have insulted her, but US officials have rejected asylum request on 20 July.

The US lawyer who helps Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from whom a large number of asylum seekers come in the United States, such as nations faced global problems with bands and domestic violence.
The New American Asylum Policy Returned the Decision of the Emigrant Advocate Council of 2014, which allowed immigrants documents that flipped from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbus County Attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires all asylum requests to be examined according to specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle," says the Good Will Report.
In addition, the advocates say in the report that the policy that rejects immigrants' admissions harms the economy of the US, insisting that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sesions ordered the Immigration Judges to stop providing asylum for victims who fled from domestic maltreatment and gangster violence.
"Asilo is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of racial, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular group social or political convictions," Sesions said in a statement of 11 July on politics.

US Ambassador accuses China of "tormos" with "propaganda ads"
One week, after a official newspaper in China released a four-page ad in a American journal for mutual profits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, said last Wednesday, referring to China Daily’s payable publication in Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of attempting to intervene in elections for Congress of the United States on 6 November.
Trump's accusation of Beijing trying to intervene elections for American Congress, noted what US officials told Roberts that it was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to presse China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently participating in an escalating trade war in which they compare import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the U.S. and China in the beginning of the War of Trade, tariffs in China were designed to strike exporters in states like Ayova, who support the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China, and former long-year gubernator of Ayova, principal exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing rushed US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Brandade, in a commentary in the Sunday number of Des Moines Register, "it currently doubles this brake by laying propaganda ads in our own free press."
"As China's government is awarded its propaganda, it is awarded a respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press, lansing a payed advertising in Des Moines Register", skriver Brandaud.
"In contraste, in the stamp of newspapers down street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements, and you will not see a real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people might have regarding the alarmante trajectory economic in China, considering that the media are under rigoros control of the Chinese Communist Party."
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish" his article, though he no indicates exact who.

Since many of the highest-republicans standing behind and defending the nominated for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano in relation to several accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, particularly women during the upcoming elections interim.
The emotions around the tavern are extreme strong, and the majority of republikans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Racher, professor of politics at the School of Politics at the University of Siracusa, before The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said that he doubted whether at the last moment of Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona)'s insistence for FBI's investigation would be sufficient to calmify the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for MoveOn Progressive Group, Friday, according to Washington Times.
Friday morning, protestants scandalized "November comes!" during a demonstration in the Senate's corridor, since Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue nomination of Cavanato in spite of the testimonies of Dr. Christian Blascious Ford, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” said Stew Rottenberg, unparticipated political analyst.
“Sometimes people say that the problem is already serious; that’s true.
"Maybe it becomes even more serious, especially among electorates in the predecessors and among younger electorates, between 18 and 29 years old, who often vote, because they do not like President."
Even before Ford's public testimony, describing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominated, the analysts suggest that there may be a response if Republicans claim to confirm the candidate.
"That has become a big confusion for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, ex-president of National Committee of the Republican Party National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavano is placed on the rock. It's about how Republicans deal with this and how they deal with it," Gay Cecil, director of Priorities USA, said, a group helping in election of democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanato's testimonies, while a little more climb to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov demonstrated that 41 per cent of the respondents believed or believed in Ford's statements, and 35 per cent said that they believed or believed in Cavanato.
38 per cent of them say that Cavanato maybe or maybe has lyrics during his tests, while 30 per cent say the same for Ford.
After Fleck's insistence, the FBI currently investigates Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, according to The Guardian.

World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burnners-Lie starts a startup that aims to rivalize on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the last project of the technology legend, Inrupt, a company that builds the open-code platform of Burns-Lie Solid.

In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Burnners-Ley, the intent behind Inrupt is a "global domination".
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
“That’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online personal data storage" or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, which are available in every browser, and at the same time are all at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines which information has access to.
The Company calls it "Get the right to give personal data."
Inrupt's idea, according to John Bruce's CEO, is the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burns-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a contract for work on the project, and a group of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, developers of technology around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Ley said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they make a full change or not when all their business models are completely renewed for one night.
"We don't want permission from them."
In a Medium publication on Saturday Burnners-Lee wrote that the mission of Inrupt was to provide energy for trade and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built based on Solid.
In 1994, Burns-Ley transformed Internet, when he founded World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Burns-Ley has had a great influence in the debate on neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt starts, Burns-Lee remains founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic for this new era on-line", adds Burnners-Ley.
Bernard Van: in memory of the priest, crucified with Victoria during the First World War
They celebrate 100 years in the native city of the only Anglican priest, endowed with Victoria's Cross for his participation in combat during the First World War.
Bernard Van won the Prize on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, unless he realized that he was defeated with the highest military honor in Britain.
A memorial was discovered on Saturday by his two uncles, in parade in Rousden, Northamptonshire.
One of his uncles, Michael Van, said that the monument "extraly symbolic" is to be detected just 100 years by the work of his grandfather, endowed with a medal.
According to London Gazette, 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his batallion via Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense butterfly and under heavy shooting of artillery and cards."
He later attacked the fire line, and with "unexpected courage" led a building forward, before he attacked an artillery arrow with one hand and killed three of the team.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72 years old, said that the acts of his grandfather are " something that I know I can never do, but it makes me to be humiliated."
"He and his brother, Dr. James Van, stabbed a vena after a parade, ahead of the Branwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that for him "is a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the youth of a real hero is demonstrated through the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they received Peppa Pig
Imagine that you're waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and you can't finally become a witness to the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 dual battles, including six of the main maps, and had to be broadcast live overnight in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just when Hegard Mosesy and Rory McDonald's were preparing to face each other, the British viewers stayed amazed when the transmission changed Peppa Pig's Peppa Pig.

Feen describes in Twitter the switching of a child animation film as "a kind of painful joke".
"Regislation regulates that at 6:00 p.m., this content is not appropriate, so the program was changed with child transmission," said Dave Schwartz, senior vicepresident of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, in response to a question about broadcasting.
"Peppa pork", "Peppa pork", "Peppa pork".
Bellator Scott Cohort, President of the Company, said that they would work on planing meetings to include British audiences in the future.
"Also, "after me, when it comes to repetitions, we can resolve the problem," he said.
“Thank you know what you want to do, you know what you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do, you want to do.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I believe in you when the program changed, we received a lot of messages, and not all of us were friends.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, but it wasn't like a government.
I promise you that next time this will not happen.
"Well, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch, it's a bitch."
That's a disgustable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "lower" because of his sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic springer of water, says that he has grown up, feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete claims that until he began to study in high school, he didn't realize that "not all are like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lawrence Lawrence, he talked about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also also also also also also also also said that that, when he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he
The permanent leader of the long-year show, Christy Young, is in hospital for several months.
When he participated in Lavern Daley's first program, he said that he felt "less" than everyone else while he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
"He said, 'Today, the feeling of little value and the fact that I'm different from others are things that give me energy and power to succeed.'"
Y aun así, Pedro ordenó que sea algo más que él, para que no sea a nadie quedaba desconfiado cuando sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez que sea a la vez.
The Dual Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in the LGBT campaigns and uses his participation in this year's Games of the British Community in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he does this, because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequence, and wants to inspire “confidence” to others.
The three-fold world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “have surprised him.”
Daley married Oscar's carrier, who is 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When you pass through so much while you're so young," - he participate en los Olympics de 14 años, y su padre murió de cancer tres años después -, "it's difficult to find someone in your age who has experienced similar ascending and falling."
The two became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley himself says that "his whole view of peace" has changed.
“If you asked me el año pasado, I would tell you that I only wanted to gain a gold medal.”
"Vet du, det er mer viktige ting än de olympiske guldmedaljerna?
"My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with cancer of the brain.
Daley told Daley that his father couldn't assume that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had tickets to the London Olympics 2012 in London - as he wanted to be on line first.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
“I holded his hand until I breathed and the moment when I realized that he was dead, finally I admitted that he wasn’t immortal.”
Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics next year and won bronze medalje.
"I just knew that all my life I dreamed about that to play the Olympics before the public at home, and there was no feeling more terrible," - he said.
This is also inspired by the choice of his first song “Proud” by Heather Smol, who accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympic Games, and still causing him to play.
Desert Island Discs broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on Sunday from 11:15 pm, British Summer Time.
Michaelson's lost form remains on rock for "Raider Cup" on Saturday.
The American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in "Raider Cup", but he will have to restore his old form if he doesn't want his record to be linked to a failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the rocket by Captain Jim Furrick for "Fourball" and "Foursom" matches Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the United States team, the five-fold winners of major tournaments spent their day as a fan and trained their hits from a distance with hopes to correct their weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who, even at the top of his career, never was among the most linear players, is in the optimal form for the difficulty playground of Le Golf National, where the long inequaliable field normally punishes every wrong strike.
And if the game itself isn't anxious enough, in the 9th match of Sunday Michaelson will rise against the precise championship of the British Open Open French Molinari, which is in a team with the newborn Tommy Fletwood, and strive to win all four of their four matches this week.
"If Americans who leave four points before 12 single matches, make a strong start, it can be found that Michaelson's match is absolutly decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his companion, although he could hardly say something much different.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
"Han är entrustet.
He's a part of the Hall of glory, and he's given a lot, as he's a part of this week.
I'm sure I'm not going to play only two matches.
I hoped it would play more, but just so it happened, and we believe that we made the right decision.
"He wants to be golfer and play, like all the others."
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most matches in the Ryder Cup, played Sunday.
This could end his career in "Raider Cup", which never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 wins, and 7 matches equals, but Furrick claimed that his presence brings other benefits for teams that are not measured with figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, cool, he's likes to joke with people and he's a great man for every team," he's said.
"I think the younger players have fun with him, especially this week.

Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, is aware that the big front can soon be stopped
"The captain of Europe's team, Thomas Burn, knows from personal experience that the big front, accumulated before the matches of a single single from the last day of Ryder Cup's last day, can easily be removed."
The dance debuted in the Walderrama match in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of Americans, but precisely the final right was nearly late and barely managed to maintain the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 .
“Siempre remember that we had a great front at Vallderrama; we had a great front at Brookline, where we lost, and we won at Vallderrama, but very difficult,” Bjorn said, after the European Team of 2018 won 5-3 Golf sessions Friday and yesterday.
Y es necesario que la historia se muestre, tanto en mi, tanto en el equipo, y se muestre en el equipo, y no se muestre en el tiempo.
Be prepared for attack tomorrow.
Go and do what is right.
Nothing was finished until you saw the end result of the table.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trofee, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused.
"I've repeated all the time that I think only about the 12 players in our team, but we're also familiar with our rivals, who are one of the greatest players in the world."
Beautiful of the presentation of players on a hard golf site, Bjorn adds: "I would never hurry with festividades.
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
"Tomorrow, you're going to get the individual execution out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test all your capacity as a golf player.
esto esto esto esto lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo
Now you can turn your partner's back, as he must be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, Captain of the rival Jim Furrick will want his players to present themselves better individually than as partners, with exceptions just Jordan Spice and Justin Thomas who took three out of four possible points.
The Furick himself was on both sides of these major returns last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then from the losing country when Europeans made the Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every word fucked," he said, in response to the question how Ben Krenshau, Captain of 1999, directed his players in the last day.
"May we have 12 matches importants, but it would be good to start the same good start as you saw on Brookline, and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these interim matches are played under a huge tension.
"So we've made our composition, and we've distributed our boys as we want, so that we can try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned the task to lead our counterattack and to rise against Rory Mcilroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Jan Paul meet other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I've chosen these players in this line, because I think that's giving us the greatest chances of success," Bjorn said.
Germany again suspended the launch of a new warship
The latest fleet of the German fleet had to be introduced into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the War Huge, but this will not happen at least until next year due to non-defected systems and majorly growing costs, reported by local media.
The introduction in operation of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading vessel of the brand of new fragmats Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a spokesman of the army.
In 2014, the maritime vessel had to join the Marine Forces, but the problems that occurred after the delivery, impacted the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships, ordered by a fleet in 2007, will replace ancien fragmatas Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful ardue, a set of anti-air and anti-navy missiles, as well as some stealth technology, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer periods of maintenance – the latest fragments must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of residence.
Continuous delays, however, implies that the avangard military ships - of which they’re saying that they’ll allow Germany to demonstrate force beyond the ocean - will already be old when they’re going into operation, says Die Zeit.
The F125 has entered the titles last year, when the German fleet officially refused to launch a fleet and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.

It is little known for the reasons for the return, but the German media quoted a series of significant “software and hardware defects” that make military ships unuseable if they were sent to a mission of war.
"Software deficiencies are particularly important, since Baden-Wuerttemberg's nautical vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 marines - only half of the crew of the Bremen's oldest fragmats.
In addition, it is evident that the vessel is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limites the possibility of marine marines to add upgrades futures.
The 7000 ton Rheinland-Pfalz (Rheinland-Pfalz) is estimated to be twice as heavy as the vessels of a similar class used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware defect, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is calculated that it has reached 3,1 trillion euro (3,6 trillion euro) from the initial 2,2 trillion euro.
Problems with the latest fragmats become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German marine forces fusion.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, chef of the Defence Commission of the German Parliament, admitted that the fleet "destroyed from ships capables of carrying out missions."
The officer said that the problem has become more difficult in time, as old ships are taken out of operation, but they are not new.

The hopes are that the discovery will light new light on the behavior of the unique flying goddess and will help guide future protective actions.
The study by scholars from National Thrust of Scotland will follow common stickers, as well as the bulbs of water nights in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key places in the property to track the activities of the stickers during the season.
NHS servers and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The audio-expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of call sounds of adhesives, as well as what kinds of sounds they release.
Then will be prepared a map of the site and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, adviser for Nature Conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of residence are the most important for adhesives and how they are used by any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, e.g. the creation of floods, as well as the best way to maintain forestry areas for adhesives and other species associated with them.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the populations of adhesives as a whole have declined significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by the construction activities that affect their refugees and lead to loss of habitats.
Risk for populations can be from wind turbines and lighting, aeroplanes and some chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks from cats domestic.

Ronaldo rejected rape claims and his advocates will judge German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denoted the claims of abuse against him as a "false news" by saying that people "will become famous" using his name.
His lawyer will judge the German journal Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that afterwards he paid her $375 000 to silence the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a video on Instagram, turning to his 142 million followers, a few hours after the posting of the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo squeezed the post as "Fake News".
“No, no, no, no.
"What they said about me today is a false news," he said before the camera the five-fold carrier of the Golden Ball.
till till till till till till till mitt mitt mitt.;
No, no, no, no.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I'm a happy man and everything's okay," smiled the footballer.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for the allegations called "inadmissible publication of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Shertz said that the footballer would ask for compensation for "moral damages that correspond to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in an apartment in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to a footballer's room where they claimed that he had raped her anal, according to the documents filed in the district court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that he was a "good boy" to "99%", but in the case he just subdued himself to "unit percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Mayorga also argued that she went to police and had taken pictures of her injuries in hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement, because she felt "arrogant of revenge" and feared "no being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement since she continues to live with the injury of the incident.

Brexit: Britain “will regret forever” that it lost car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as a leader of the world in automotive production after Brexit,” said business secretary Greg Clarke.
"He added that it's "disturbant" that Toyota UK have said to BBC that if Britain abandoned EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production in their factory in Burnston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to a loss of jobs.
In Burnston, where Auris and Avensis models were produced, lanely, cerca de 150.000 autos, 90% of which exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain quit EU in late March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cook, Toyota CEO in Burnaston.
Other manufacturers of cars from UK, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about the abandonment of the EU without agreement and how the transfrontalier trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they will close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in cases of Brexit without transactions.
Toyota's line of production works on the principle "exact time" and the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from both UK and EU for automotives made customized.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which according to the industry may lead to delays and partial deficiency.
Toyota would not be able to wait for more than one day to complete their inventory in the Darbisher factory, said the company, and so the production will stop.
Mr. Clarke said, Teresa May's "schematic plan" for future relations with EU is "accurat kalibrated to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal, which will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to gain this opportunity," he said in the program 4's Today at BBC Radio.
"Important not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, we are absolute convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota can't tell how long the production will stop, but in a long term they warn that extra costes will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately will result in loss of jobs.

The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Vice-Chef Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein can be "delayed for another week", as the fight of the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Cavano continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian intervention in elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia’s assistants and the potential impediment of justice by the president’s side.
"Trump's deputy prosecutor, or no, or in this way threaten Mueller's independence, for months he's feeding Washington's rumors."
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reporting to submit a remission.
Instead, while Trump was at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York, he was declared a meeting with him for Thursday.
Trump shared that "have preferred no" would release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the auditions of the Senate jurisprudence, for which both Cavanato and one of the women who accused him of sexual disturbance – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
Trump ordered Friday a weekly investigation by the FBI of the complaints against Kavano, delaying Senate's total vote.
Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday, according to Fox News.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she responded: "Everything still hasn't been determined for this week, maybe it's this week, but all the other things that happening in Supreme Court, in my opinion, maybe it's possible to be delayed for the next week.
"But we'll see, and I always try to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would question this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House of 10 September.
Chris Wallace, chefer of the lecture, interrogeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sanders responded that rare press conferences are not due to unanimity to the “demonstrative behavior” of television journalists, although he shared: “I cannot say that I do not agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior.”
Then she insisted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"President conductes more sessions with questions and answers than every president before him," she added, without citing evidence: "we checked these statistics."
“As for the press, it’s better than to talk to me, if media representatives have chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States.
"We try to do this often, and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in the past few weeks, and this will replace press conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the president of the United States."
Trump reply regularly to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with host high-end persons.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president might show why, with his excentric behavior and moments strange behavior in front of journalists.

The Minister of Health contacted personal of the EU, working in the National Health Service of Scotland, in order to express their gratitude to the state and their desire to stay in their positions after Brexit.
Jean Frieman, deputate of the Scottish Parliament, sended letters in the remaining less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already engaged in the cost of the initiated procedures for the statute of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Frieman wrote: "During the summer of the negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, and this autumn is expected to take decisions.
But the Government of Britain also advances in preparing for a possible scenario without trading.
I am sure that this is a very uncertain time for all of you.

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher gear tax when buying real estate in UK
According to new plans of the Conservatives, foreign buyers will charge a higher turbo tax when buying real estate in UK, with additional funds will help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
"State Chase expects to increase over 120 million pounds British per year, which will help the homeless
Teresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay higher hedge tax when buying real estate in Britain, while extra incomes will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Korbin’s efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible residences and is aimed at people with high income.
The increment of the tax of the herbs will affect individuals and corporations who do not pay taxes in Britain, and with additional incomes will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the streets.
Independence – which is a addition to the actual tax of awards, including higher levels, introduced 2 years ago for second residence and property purchased for awards – can be up to 3 %.
The state hash expects that the assets will increase to 120 million pounds britanniques per year.
About 13% of the newly built buildings in London are purchased from people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price rise and makes it difficult for those who buy their property for the first time to intervene in the real estate market.
Many of the wealthy regions, particularly in the capital, have become “cities destructive” because of the great number of foreign merchants who spend the majority of their time outside the country.
The new politics appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the tax of herbs to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused the major constructive companies of holding high prices of property, robbing land, but not using it, and asked Mrs. May to abandon the quotas for available housings, to repair the "show of houses" of Britain.
Mr. Corbin declare atraktive series of proposals for reforms for housing, including control of rents and end of expulsion "non-vins".
He also wants to give counsellors greater power to build new houses.
“ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ ‘ “ “ “ “ last “ “ ‘ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ “ ‘ “ “ “ “ “ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Time Time as as as as as as as as as as as as as Prime Prime Prime, to Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re Re
And this means that we will repair the market of the dispersed to dwell in the tabernacles.
The UK will always be open with gates for those who want to live, work, and build life here.
But it is not a lot of people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy houses as easy as those who work hard in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own house has gone too far in time, and the disturbance of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My goal is to lead the team of Scotland"
Sunderland's manager Jack Ross said, "The biggest ambition" in his career was to be top coach in Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old Scotland accepted the challenge to regain the club from northeast England, which is currently on the third position in the First League, at three points from the first place.
He went to Stadium of Light this summer, after the previous season brought Saint Miran back to the Scottish High League.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I recorded a match for B team and that's all that," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“Pero I grown up with the matches of Scotland in Hampdon, which we saw together as a child with my father, so the National Team always attracted me.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ross's predecessors like managers of Sunderland are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moss, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Cannio.
The former instructor of Aloa Atletic stated that he did not experience anxiety as heir as heir of such confirmed names in such a famous club like that, and before he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town and Ipsuic Town.
"I think the success of the moment will be measured with positive response to the question: "Can I return this club to the High League?"
"Because on structure, base, and conditions, it's uncertainly on level of the High League," he said.
"It's not easy to return to the highest level of football, but I'll accept that I've achieved success here only if I'm able to take the team back there."
Ross is only manager for three years, after spending a while assistente in Dumberton, 15 months in Harts Coachship.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into Third Division and transformed Saint Miran from a falling team into a Champions League winner in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartleypull, Foxcark, Saint Miron, and Hamilton Academy.
"I really was on the cross," recordó, en el momento en que Aloa fue.
“I really thought that being manager is the best place for me, including before being active player.
I have done the good thing, I have done the good thing, I have done the good thing.
But to be a player sometimes is difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to handle every week.
I'm still facing the same levels of stress and tension in work, but I just feel that being manager is the true direction for me.
"I always wanted to be manager, and now that I really do it, I never felt comfortable in my skin throughout my conscious life."

Ideal time for beer is 5:30pm Saturday, reveals research
Summer heat increases revenue of fighters to survive British pubs, but it has accumulated more tension for the chains of restaurants.
The group of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2,7 per cent in July, but revenue in restaurants decreased by 4,8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of CGA, who composed statistics, said: "Due to the long-term solar time and longer than England's expected participation in the World Cup, in July follow a model similar to June, when pubs reported a growth of 2,8 per cent, but restaurants gained a more intense impact.
The decline of 1,8 per cent in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and bars for drinks, scored the best results in their growth, compared to the downstream movement of restaurants.
In the same way, eating bubbles also suffered from sunny time, but not just the number of owners of restaurants.
Imaginable, people just wanted to go out and drink something.
"In pubs and bars, the sales of beverages jumped 6,6 per cent per month, while in foods there was a decline of 3 per cent."
Paul Neuman, from RSM Analyzers of Retreat and Entertainment, said: "These results continue the trend we noticed in late April.
Time and influence of major social or sport events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the sector of services outside the house.
It's not surprising that the group of restaurants continues to suffer, though the fall in sales by 4,8 per cent per year could be particularly painful in addition to cost constant.
"The long hot summer wasn't able to appear in a worse time for managers of food plants, and only the weather will show whether the temperatures that we experimented in August will bring the desired pause."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered, was 2,7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in degradation of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the analyst of sales in the sector of pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data about performance of 47 operative groups, total turnover over £9 billion, and is a solid indicator in the industry.

Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers with cows, share opinions online
The company that produces breast pumps, shared opinions online with advertising, which compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that nurture.
In order to note the marketplace of the expected "first noiseless breast pump in the world suitable for carrying", the Elvie consumer technology company launched the ridiculous musical-video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives infants to express.
"Four real mothers dance in a cabra, full of seno, in a background of a song with a text, "Yes, I'm coming, but you can't see a patch" and "If you don't notice, it's not a vimeo, it's my breasts."
The song continued: "Pomp, pump, feed the babes, pump, pump, bring your friends."
However, the advertisement, posted on Facebook page of the company, caused online disputes.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from the viewers, many claiming that it ponderates the "people" of the dairy processing industry.

Elvie Breast Pump is collected discreetly in sudden for infants (Elvie/Mother)
"It is perfectly understandable that it is traumatisable both for mother and mother and baby.
"But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
And some more said, "That's not enough advert."
Others defended the ad, while a woman admitted that she considers the song "except fun".
“I think that’s a genial idea.
I'd buy that if I'd still breastfeed.
I'm like a cow. I'm like a cow.
Announcement is a little bit of announcement, but I accept it as it is.
“This product is genial,” wrote someone.
Otro comentario: "Este is a joke ad addressed to mothers who make up (frequently at work or in the toilet) and feel like "crawls".
"This is not a publicity, arrogant or condemning the milk processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women reveals that they danced with discrete pumps placed in their subtitles.
The concept of the campaign is based on the vision that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is totally noiseless, no wires or tubes, and is collected discreetly in a basement for breastfeeding, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they go.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO of Creative Director at Mother, comments: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative marketing.
We wanted to concentrate the attention of the breastfeeding of the breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it, simultaneously showing the incredible sensation of liberty, which will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie pump falls in the main news.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared in the padium for the designer Martha Yakubovsky, using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants were secretly transferred to tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has jumped steadily, although the monthly crossing of the border remains relatively unchanged, partly because the acute rhetoric and politics by the Trump administration difficulty the settlement of children with adhesives.
Normally, the majority of defendants are immigrants without documents, who fear that they risk their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential defendants and other adults from family should provide fingerprints, while these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, senior officer of the Imigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who wished to become prosecutors of non-company minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal dossiers.
"Maximum 80 per cent of those who are defendants, or who are members of family of defendants, live illegally in the country, while majority of them are foreign criminals.
"So, we will continue to pursue these persons," he said.
In an effort to deal with the registration of these children, the authorities imposed new rules, which require some of them to appear before the tribunal within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, as was the preceding norm, according to the staff of the cabinet.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, rather than personally, to present their case as a legal status before a judge of immigration.

The longer children remain detained, the more likely they become deprimed or deprimed, which may lead to violent injuries or attempts to escape, according to employees of the hospitals and reports that have gone out of the system in the last few months.
Attorneys shared that this concern has grown in large facilities, such as that in Tornillo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored due to the scale of place.

France has over 1000 soldats in countries devastated by the country of war.
"Mohammed said that the conditions are tolerant and can return, accusing "some Western states of "exploring fears of unnecessary fears" that urge refugees to stand out."
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
“Importamental is something that is totally humanitarian.”
"United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for Syria's restoration until there will be an agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
The UN diplomats have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major fort of rebel rebels in Idlib enables progress in political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia over the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement has "evidente deadlines" and expressed hopes that military action will be directed towards jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaida Front Al-Nusra, who will be "destroyed".
The UN Messenger Stafan de Mistura hopes soon to invite the first meetings of the new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to prepare a project of the post-guerre constitution of Syria and to go on a path to elections.
Mualem exposed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, affirming that the work of the panel should be limited to "respect of members of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no intervention.

Investments are inflicted in the most controversial race in the pre-elections for a place in Congress
No wonder the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money thanks to the reorganization of Congress districts and from there two titles for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in Pittsburgh's predecessor stated the conservative democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb is facing another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly competing with the new 17th.
The cards were drawn again, after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordained in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district devastated financial disputes between the principal financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Commission for Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb is celebrated in Pennsylvania after the heavy victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won district 20 points.
Political experts believe that the Democrats have a slight advantage.
US considers the imposition of sanctions on El Salvador due to its support for China, then revoked
The diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, and also had a hotel in Panama, until partners abandoned the management team from Trump Organization.
Representatives of the Department of State have decided to respond to the leaders of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions that Taiwan no longer recognizes,” said Heather Nawart earlier this month, a spokesman of the Department.
But sanctions were planned only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $ 140 million US aid from America for combating narcotics, in order for development and economic assistance.
The sanctions proposed, including abolition of financial assistance and visa restrictions targeted, would be tormented by the state of Central America with its unemployment and percentage of killings.
With the progress of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America have delayed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which serves to continue a similar accumulation in the last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the inflammatory of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the Supreme Administrative Authority stated that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively stopped any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice-President Mike Pence announced that he would participate in the conference planned for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the collection, the diplomats say.
And the three American ambassadors silently returned to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton rejected comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who wished to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in the internal debates.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Historia of Research
The next move could be report of the Special Advisor Robert Müller on the possibility of prevention of justice by Mr. Trump, while the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
He argued that Mr. Mueller directs his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has negotiated with Russia during his campaign of attack against our elections.
If the presidency of Congress changes, it will be evident that Mr. Trump will have to take account of this organ just when he prepares to stand up before the voters, as well as perhaps before the jury meetings composed by his colleagues.
I'm not aware of this, and I'm not afraid that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - and that's not like him in Europe.
"Non, we all from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, we must make these elections, which will affect how long the fight will be extended.

Rosenstein zagazi since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly to record the president and speculated with the opinion that it is not suitable for post.
Mr. Rosenstein claimed that the story in Times is incorrect.
"How do we react, if the new investigation against Bret Cavanato, which the FBI demanded, is not complete or just, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court in spite of the accusations of sexual abuse and false testimoniation?
"Oh, and above all, will we vote in the pre-elections of Congress, if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?"
"If we're going through these trials, demokracia's waiting for it for a long winter.

Gream Dorans from Rangers is an optimist in confrontation with Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive equality in Spain against Williams earlier this month, will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G Group of the League of Europe.
Contusion in the knees did not allow the semi-defender Gregor Dorans to play his first match for the season before the equation 2-2 with Williams, but he believes that for Rangers this result can be transformed into a trampline to a greater achievement.
"We won an important point because Williams is a good adversary," said 31-year-old footballer.
"We've got a match with hope that we can win something and we've gone with a point.

"We're going to look at Thursday, another great night of our matches in Europe.
I hope that we can fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match, because they have achieved a good result last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience, we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely difficult after everything that happened, despite my contusions and changes in the club, but now it appears that things have been in the direction of the rules.
The team is good, and the guys really have fun, the trainings are beneficial.
I hope that we will be able to push all our forces to forget the season last and achieve the desired success."
The women are worried about their pensions.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study share that they have discussed the cost of long-term care with their husbands.
Only 10% of them talked to their children about this question.
“Horees want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snajder, vicepresident of Nationwide’s Life Insurance Activity Sector.
Here's what you can start.
You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't explain your wishes beforehand.
Junk with your consultant and family discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed Life Insurance policy with cash value to help you cover these costs or self-assurance with your money – if you have money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Fight your legal battles already at the beginning.
Appoint yourself a healthcare administrator, so you have a certain trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider also the idea of a manager in financial affairs.
You can choose a trusted person to take the financial decisions in your name and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are insolvency.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your older parents need urgent medical assistance and travel to the hospital.

Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutor of New York demands death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where 8 people were killed, a rare penalty, which was not executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is claimed that Saipov, a 30-year-old, has used a truck rented a Home Depot to carry out the assault in October at a wheelchair near West Side in the Manhattan Valley, gasing pedestrians and bicyclers on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "has killed" eight victims and "has "has" caused severe bodily lesions, according to the notification of intentionality in connection with the request of death penalty filed in Southern District, New York.

Seven weeks after the assault, an extensive federal court of justice filed a prosecutor act of Saipov 22 points, including eight accusations of murder related to a racket, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as accusations of violence and destruction of MPS.
The attack requires "serious planning and intentionality", said the prosecutors, describing how Saipov's execution is "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sifulo Habibulaevitch Saipov causale trauma, damaged and lost family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Irley, Erann Feluki, Alexander Damien Panuco", se dice in the notification.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.

Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan people, did not show a feeling of disgust in the days and months after the attack, according to legal documents.
"He's notified to the investigators that he's feeling good of what he's doing," says the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, claiming the accused act.
He also asked him in his hospital room to place the ISIS flag, the police told him.

David Paton, one of the federal public defenders, representing Saipov, noted, "are evidently deceived" by the prosecutor's decision.

Saipov's Defence Team before he wanted the prosecutor's office not to demand death sentence.
Deputy of Parliament of the Conservatives says NaJJL FARAŽ must lead negotiations about Brexit
Nigel Farag refused to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest of the Conservative Conference.
The British Independence Party's former leader said that politicians must "reflect pressure" - as one of the members of Teresa May's own party, he proposed that he leads negotiations with EU.

Allieds insiste on that it will progress in an attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostil reactions, and insiste on Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between their packet and the "chaos".

"We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected the arguments that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The perception that Britons have changed their opinion and want to stay is totally false."
Andréea Jenkins, a representative of the Conservatives, also participated in the meeting, told reporters: “I just say: Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the broad public, opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually went out on the street and actually helped us to be elected.
Please cut "Chequers" and start listening.
She added a open message to Ms. May: "Primiters keep their position when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farag said at the meeting that politicians must "reflect pressure" if they plan to change the decision taken after a referendum in 2016.
"Now is the question of trust between us people and our political class."
"We're trying to change Brexit and we're reunid here today to tell you "we're not allowing you to change this."
In a statement to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge of change Brexit, feel pressure.
"We mobilize the army of this nation, which helped us to overcome Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governing, UK proud."

Grand Prix of Russia: Louis Hamilton is increasingly closer to the world title after the instructions of his team helped him defeat Sebastian Feel
From the moment when Walter Botas was classified earlier than Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously stressed Hamilton, while defending his position in the first two conquests, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit-stop and allowed Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a piste-stop in the next round and went out after the Fetel, but Hamilton managed to ride it after a trap manicure and a ride "goma to goma", which forced Ferrari's pilote to liberate the interior of the track with the desirable deficiency of the man's defence for a triple triple to man's defence for a triple triple.
Over his 21th birthday Max Verstopen started from the back rows of the start reel and was seventh after the end of the first tour.
After that, he even led for a long period of the race, as he decided to change his tyres later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly to overcome Kim Raykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered a pit-stop in the 44th round, but he couldn't swap enough in the next eight rounds, and finally, Raykonen finished the fourth.
It was a hard day, because Waltery did a great job all weekends and became a real gentleman when I let him go.
"Tip did an extraordinary job to win the first two places on the ground floor," Hamilton said.
This really was a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump played with Senator Dayan Finstein of Raley on Saturday because of her claim that she has not spread the letter by Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses the applicant of the Supreme Court of Bret Cavanano of sexual injury.
During a conversation of raleys in West Virginia, the president did not mention direct the testimonies given by Ford in front of the Senate jurisprudence, but instead commented how what happened in Senate shows that people are "mal and irreproachable and irreproachable".
"Entonces, por lo tanto, se puede ver lo que es bueno, lo que es bueno, y lo que es bueno, y lo que es bueno, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo, y lo que es malo."

But the refusal of her side was not well accepted by the president who commented on a rally Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this was a very bad language of body body very bad, very bad language of body body,” he said.

Analyst exposes chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The Prosecutor's Office concluded with his exponence in the case this Saturday in a re-prosecution against a man who is accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
The analyst Paul Roulette from the US Department of Justice testified for hours as a witness expert in the analysis of intelligence.
He told the jury how he used records from mobile phones to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Queenton Teless and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night of his death.
Roulette stated that he had received data about the location of several cell phones, indicating that Tellis was with Chambers in the night of his death, back to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.

New York Daddy judges couple after release for a "rassist" message
A New York Grandma judged a couple for dismissal due to discrimination, after receiving a incorrectly sent message from a mother who complained that she was "the next black skin".
The twin refuses to be racists, seemingly like a desire to be "destroyed".
Linzy Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was ashamed when she found out that the new babysitter, Jizzell Morris, was a black girl when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEHEEAEAEAEA, BLACK BLACK," wrote Ms. Plasko-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
but instead instead instead, instead instead, she she, she, she she, she she, she, Mor Mor Mor Mor, Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor, twice twice twice twice twice, twice, twice, twice, twice, and, and, she she, Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor Mor, and, and, and, instead instead, instead, instead, instead, instead, instead, instead, she she, but, instead, she she, but, instead, she she,,,...,
After she realized her error, the sensation of "innocent" Ms. Plasco-Flaxman released Ms. Morris, stressing that the ex-baby girl who was African-American was not doing her work well and she expected a Philippines, reports New York Post.
Mrs. Moris received a retribution for one day afterwards he sent a taxi home.
Now Morris judged the couple for compensation due to the resignation, wanting $350 per day for a six-month contract for which she initially hired, although she didn't have a contract.
“Entonces, en el caso de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la jurisprudencialidad de la juris.”
In response to the petition, the couple argued that they were not racists, adding that the cessation of Morris' occupation was a reasonable act, because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sendte a her something that she no wanted to tell her.
She's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” said the man of the Post Joel Plasko.

-Oh! -Oh!
Think about it."
Plasko argued that his wife had borne only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to attack someone like this?”
“It’s not very nice,” adds the banker.
While the judiciary is still in the process of examination, then public opinion quickly condemns quickly the couple in social networks, ignorant them for their behavior and logic of their behavior.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers wouldn't feel a connection with a speech bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted by the public, explains: “It is difficult to sit in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before the book is published, and to sit in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's very funny after we know about Paddington's great success."
She shared that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before she inspired to write a child book about a little mesh game, would feel optimistic for possible rejection of the book, adding that she celebrates 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death.
“As for Paddington, which she describes as a ‘important member of our family’, she adds that her father was secretly proud of his ultimate success.
"Eh, Simon, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk, elk,
“But as Paddington felt so real, it’s as if you had a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of him, although you’re really not your job.
I think he accepted Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always assigned the dignity of Paddington himself."

The future of Bret Cavano is questioned after the FBI starts investigation
“I wondered if we really could achieve what he wanted – we could unite our efforts with a limited duration and limited scope – perhaps we could have achieved what he wanted,” said Mr. Fleck Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission would “destroy” in spite of an overparty blockation.
Why Mr. Cavanano and his supporters from Republicans didn't want the FBI to investigate?
Demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstrationen demonstration
The pre-elections are only after five weeks, 6 November – if, as it is expected, Republicans do not perform well, they will seriously harm their attempts to be elected their representative in the Supreme Court of the State.
George W. Bush called senators, invited them to support Mr Cavano, who worked for Mr Bush in White House, and with his help met his wife, who was personal secretary of Mr Bush.
What's going on after FBI's reports?
In the Senate there will be votes, where there are 51 republikans and 49 demokrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano could receive at least 50 votes in Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidature for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea "reduce" at Kim
The South Korean legislature claims that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chong-un came to power 7 years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citando data from South Korean Ministry of Unity, affirmed that last year there were 1127 refugees, and compared to 2011, they were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher sums required by counterbandists of people, are key factors.
No official comment by Phenyan.
Most refugees from North finally get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul declares that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed illegally the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
"Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and it passes more easily than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) which divides both Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, often forced them to repatriate.

This took place after a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed jointly working for a Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Yong Ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be sure of our national security and under these circumstances there is no way of first unilaterally disarmament," Mr. Ri said in a speech before UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanato "isterial" and declare it isn't suitable for service in Supreme Court
The minority leader of Congress Nancy Pelosi named the candidate for Supreme Court Bret Cavanano "isterial" and declared that he was too disproportionate to serve in Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.

Kavano emotionally rejected the claims that he had committed sexual abuse over Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, when both were teenagers.
Kavano was very emotional during his initiation word, while he was almost screaming and feeling when he discussed his family and his students years.

How the War of Trade between the USA and China can serve Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were striking, and while the battle still gets speed, a break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, shot the first warning valve this year, imposing taxes of key elements from exporting China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension emerged this week with the new tariffs that affect the production of $200 trillion (150 trillion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all the goods imported to the USA from China.
"Peking, every time, refunded new tariffs, 5-10% of US goods for $60 billion.
China refused to respond to any attack of the United States and soon did not expect the second largest economy in the world to ignore it.
To make Washington reject it means to submit to the demands, but to make a head publicly before Washington it will be too shameful for Si Jinping, China’s president.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards correctly, the pressure of the War Commercial with the US could help China in the long term with a reduction of mutual dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick resolution politico both in Washington and Beijing could create conditions for a crisis economic in either country, en realidad, it's more dangerous than the observers admitted before," said Abigail Greys, co-worker of science on issues related to Asia.
