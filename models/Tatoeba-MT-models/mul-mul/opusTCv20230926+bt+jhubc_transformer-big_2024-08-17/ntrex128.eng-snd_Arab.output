Los Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silencio como Iglesias en Harlem Struggle
"Historyically, antikkes peoples I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there's nobody."
.. he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he ..he
"Socialize people in different way today," he said.
"Bars no longer are a neighborhood living room where people go on regular basis."

Churches, agrega, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuarys of the neighborhood.
"La mayor parte de los que compran condominio en estos edificios será blanca, y, por lo tanto, acelerará el día de que estas iglesias se fermen mutuamente, porque es improbable que la mayor parte de estas personas que se mueven en estos condominios se convierten en miembros de estas iglesias."
Both Churches were constructed by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's Decade later.
La original congregación Methodist White se desapareció en 1930s.
Una congregación black, la cual se adoraba nearby, turbulense la edifice.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a principal street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted a hiring or promoting blacks.
A fire in 1939 abandoned the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor people."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "un instrument historico irreplaceable."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What's played at St. Martin's in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay leaders of the church, some by Episcopal diocese.
The vestiry - the governing body of the parity, composed of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would "seek to pass through costes" to the vestiry, even though the vestiry wasn't involved in recruiting the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
"Alguns of the parisians complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.

Investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury's said it would duplicate the size of its beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existent ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similares to those found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly - something more and more demanded by younger shoppers.
Además, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop va testando concessions en dos stores de Sainsbury, la primera de los cuales abre en Croydon, South London, la semana pasada, mientras que la segunda abre en Selly Oak, Birmingham, la tarde de este año.
Shopping online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenence stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO de Sainsbury's, ha deklarado que los outlets se verán cada vez más similares a department stores, ya que supermarket chain se intenta combatir contra discounters Aldi y Lidl con más servicios y non-food.
Sainsbury's has putted Argos outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted sales of grocery and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a line over how to divide revenues from the shops of chemists in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sale 281 store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, 3 years ago.
It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a wide range of brands luxury skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director comercial de Sainsbury, explique: "We've transformed the look and feeling of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in co-workers specially trained who will be on hand to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to match every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations means we are now a impresionant beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes last memorial hit by 'rewriting history' row
Its banding would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
Pero Cromwell Society describe Mr Crick's suggestion as "folly" and "hoping to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of Cromwell Society, affirmed: "Era inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of opinion of the 19th century and part of the historyography of a figure that many believe still worth celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell se observe by many, perhaps more in the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, naturally, monarchie.

More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's arrested testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that presumably occurred in 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Entretanto, the political standoff continued, with broadcasters interromper regular programming for the last minute twist of Friday: un accord insinuated by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for FBI to conduct one week investigation of accusations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh rushed her drunkly and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in unpacience testificate, affirmed 100% certain that it's not happening.
Seguramente, más de 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
Companies are counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel y MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some difficulty meditating people who watch in offices.

Interess remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured as CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning being cried by protestants while trying to ride a lift to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.

Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before lift closed, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks were all covering live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with understanding that FBI would look at the accusations against the nominee for the next week, which minority Democrats have urged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election had power, because it seemed obvious Republicans wouldn't have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened FBI investigations in allegations against Kavanaugh.

Promoted Livingston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to be the difference as Gary Holt's side move level with Hibernian in second.

Scott Robinson broke through but draged his effort over the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only direct his effort wide after sliding into meeting Craig Halkett's head over the goal.
Hosts were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could trouble visitors at set pieces.

'Phenomenal' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A fenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Their style of play and staff has scarcely changed since their return to top flight, but great credit must go to Holt for the way he has galvanized team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, marshaving a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their fingers throughout.
The Rangers, however, were inspired.
As they were good at times under Gerrard, they were very short of those standards.
Their final ball was missing - only once they cut the home side open - and it's something of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in mid-table.

The series of earthquakes was felt in a area with 2,4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that energy released by Friday's massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima in World War II.

Nugroho deklara que victimes y daños could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 km) nord de Palu, una zona llamada Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were totally crippled with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There's more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were going to the affected areas.
"That's already a tragedy, but it could make much worse," she said.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticated for notifying that tsunami hit Palu, though officials said waves came within the time of the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media a man on top floor of a building can be heard shouting frantically warnings about the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Inner minutes a mur de water crash up the shore, carrying edifices and cars.
Reuters was unable to instantly authenticate the video.
The quake and tsunami caused a major power outbreak that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.

Aeroport de la ciudad ha reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.

US should double A.I. finance
“As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, US should double the amount it spends on research in this field,” says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after different parts of the US government have made AI announcements, just as US generalmente lacks a formal AI strategy.
China introduced plan last year: it aims to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so much further behind America, and we are looking for next breakthrough in AI", he said.
Doubling funding could double the chances that next big AI achievement will be done in the USA, Lee told CNBC in a interview this week.
Lee, cuyo libro "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" publicated this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, es CEO de Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a AI system that bat the player American Othello highest ranked, y posteriormente era executive at Microsoft Research and president of the branch of Google China.
Lee reconoció precedentes competiciones de tecnología gubernamental de Estados Unidos, como Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Robotics Challenge, y preguntó cuándo next would be, a fin de ayudar a identificar next visionaires.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to win government grants, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google y otras compañías tecnológicas han contratado luminarias de universidades para trabajar en AI in recent years.
Lee affirmed that change in migration policy could also help the US to strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think cards green should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Intelligence Artificial Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people at academic institutions similar to the way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations deletar money to researchers of the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, Department of Defense of the United States founded a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
DARPA anunció que $2 bilion investe in a initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently investe more than $100 million per year in AI research.

"People of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked their bids for membership for the EU and NATO.

"If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a rate of unemployment of more than 20%.
"I believe that great majority will be favorable because more than 80 percent of our citizens are favorable to EU and NATO", he added Zaev.

A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in referendum - below the required turnout.

intolerance to those who speak their minds
"After the momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it's hardly surprised.
I'm the latest in a line of working people to say that we're not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she resolutely stand up to antisemitism.
In my case, motion censoral criticized me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically similare issues on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the national security, on Europe, on the ironically similar issues on which Jeremy ne concorded with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During 8 years as the local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
Lamentablement, today it's not tone of many meetings and promise of "kind, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it's actually started ever.

This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues cuyos I had previously thought I shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to make a U turn and take positions with which I would never agree otherwise - whether on national security or the EU single market.
"Everything I speak publicly - and it really doesn't matter what I say - there's a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, condemning the politics of the center, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.

I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because comments about me tend to be political.

One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we are no longer that large church and with every "no-confidence" movement or change of selection rules the party becomes more narrower.
I have had many advice in the past two years calling me to keep my head down, not to be so voiceless and then I would "be okay."

I've never hidden my politics, including in the last elections.
Nottingham East nobody could in any way be confused about my political positions and areas of divergence with current leadership.
"At those who promoted the move on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is going to a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

"Bolivia nunca will give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he adds.
"Determination is a chance to see that we must overcome the past."

John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence and this continues in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which se fortaleza only by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a sector educational that can design and implement a bespoke school curriculum, we see modern languages continues as a popular and desired subject of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that's going to his head.
"Si tu parlas lui in his own language, he's going to his heart."
"This is a powerful reminder that we can't trust only English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher degree A.
Datos, recolected from 74 schools of SCIS Members, sugerimos que 72 por ciento de los estudiantes lograron Higher Grade A in Mandarin, mientras que 72 por ciento de los estudiantes de German, 69 por ciento de los estudiantes de Francés, 63 por ciento de los estudiantes de Francés y 63 por ciento de los estudiantes de Spanish también lograron A.
Esto demonstra que skoles independentes de Scotland soportan idiomas extranjeros como abilitaciones vitales que niños y adolescentes sin duda in the future requerirán.
Languages now, as a subject choice, are held in the same regard as subjects STEM (science, teknologia, ingeniería y matematica) in independent school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey by UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons the employers gave to fight to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills skills.
Por eso, cada vez más, language skills are becoming imperatives in order to prepare young people for their future career.
With more prospective jobs opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Independent from the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future having a lifelong skills like this.
Be able to communicate direct with people from foreign countries will automatically place a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation and with French was the only language spoken by a dual-digit percentage, 15%.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91>
Having multiple languages, particularly those of economies developing, will equipar children with better chances of finding meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are deemed to be the most important for UK when looking forward to 2020, like Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever interests of your child, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teacher staff who are specialists in this area.
Scots independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and hand them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this time, in a global business environment, it cannot be negated that languages continue to be vital for future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
De hecho, lenguajes modernos deberían verdaderamente ser considerados "internacional communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for the young people of Scotland.
Dee, dee, dee.

Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show stomach for fighting to keep hopes alive heading to Sunday singles
After three single sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes might just have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a totally invented sporting concept but one that players really believe in, and never more so than in competitions like these.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're carrying that as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth while he walked out for the day.
Europa, naturalmente, has the advantage of four points forward with 12 more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails though and they have much to encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them has three points from four.
Spieth es letal de tee a green y es lider por ejemplo.
Those turbulent cries of celebration gained more voice as his round continued, sinking a crucial pocket to match four all-square when he and Thomas were two down after two.
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
All these players are left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indiscutible story of the Ryder Cup.
"Everythrough but beautiful couple of Europe is four of four and can't make any wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back ni on Friday morning.
"Entonces, de la manera energia, de la manera energia, de la manera energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia, de la forma energia.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
But the talk of the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short work of Sergio Garcia, the fourballs hero of the morning, when he was coupled with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine duck the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole which they never got close to climb out of.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinant to watch closely because of interacciones between couples, advice they give, advice they don't, and the way that a strategy can change in a moment.
Europa has played better as a team until now and take a significant lead to the final day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach for the fight that some, especially Stateide, doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead to the final day of Ryder Cup
Europe will take a healthy advantage to the final day of the Ryder Cup after emergence from Saturday's fourballs and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood y Francesco Molinari led a cargo con dos victories sobre un Tiger Woods combating to take their highest so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, offering to maintain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine 2 years ago, dominated american side misleading in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
US offers more resistance in the foursomes, won two matches, but they couldn't eat in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs 8 points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a line while he and Molinari, denominada "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend are only the second couple to win four points from their opening of four matches in history of Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then gelated superbly to beat a deflated Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two matches on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance but he now has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a line.
Justin Rose, refreshed for the fourballs in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.

North Korea says 'no way' will disarma unilaterally without trust
North Korea's minister of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Saturday, the sanctions continued to deepen their misturbation in the United States and there was no way that the country would abandone their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" in the last year, such as stop tests nuclear and missiles, demontage test site nuclear, and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
"Without any trust in America, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there will be no way that we will unilaterally disarma ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated known North Korea complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took step-by-step steps, his declaration seemed significant in that it not rejected unilateral denuclearization off hand like Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refer to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving US president and a North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work towards "denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking for formal end of the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax hard international sanctions on North Korea.
"U.S. insiste sur la "prime denuclearization" y aumenta el nivel de pression por sanctions para alcanzar their purpose de forma forcivile, e incluso oponent la "declaration of end of war,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bringe us to our knees is a tube dream of people who are ignorant about us.
"Maybe la problem, la sanctions continues to deepen our degradation."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Independientemente, minister assertiona three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in in the last five months, adding: "Si la parti de la question de denuclearization era Korea South and not USA, la denuclearization of Korean Peninsula wouldn't have come to such a deadlock."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from the last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the continent US with North Korea's rackets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racket man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "destroy total" North Korea last year, urged Kim for his courage to take steps to desarmament, but said much work still needed to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearized.

China and Russia arguen that UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
Mike Pompeo, secretary of State of the U.S. Mike Pompeo, informó la U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of sanctions of the Security Council must continue vigorously and without failing until we realize the complete, final, verificated denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to choke funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in front of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea 3 times this year, but his last trip wasn't good.

Harvard Students Learn to Get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its graduates getting more sleep in a attempt to fight the growing macho culture of study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
A academic found students of the world number one university are often ignorant when it comes to very basics about how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designa the course, which he think is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation was learning.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
Course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and atletic performance, as well as improve their overall wellness.
Paul Barreira, profesor de psichiatrie at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services of the university, decisió la university decisió introducir kursus after finding students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The long course of the hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a image of a sleep room, where the students click on cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students" instantly.
Pero we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", agreguó Prof. Czeisler.
Kultura de pride in 'pulling a all-night' persiste, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant deprivation of sleep was a growing problem.
Assurance you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the 'arma secret' of a student to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as deprivation of sleep puts the brain in mode of hunger, making them hunger constantly.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, it's to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the negative effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal downs Gerrard's mens
Rangers suffered another end of distant day blues as Dolly Menga's strike assigned Steven Gerrard's disconnected side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side was seeking to record their first victory on the road since 4-1 triumph of February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points de acronym of the roadway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like leveling.
while Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And could have been further difficulty in store for Rangers after the linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after a object was apparently thrown away from the end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that broke past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, de otro lado, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point out of Hearts last week and would have been contented with the way of his well-dropped dress suffocated their adversaires in every turn.
Rangers could have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
Deben haber scored only two minutes in when Menga's first-time layout send Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder turbulented his big chance.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide on back post.
Rangers took control but seemed to have more hope than believe about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos sintió definitivamente debió have had a penalty on the four-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collide, pero arbiter Steven Thomson refuerzo de Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed only two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike.
Although Livi's 34th-minute opener might have been opposed to play run, nobody can negate that they deserved it for their graft alone.
Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Arfield ne reaccione, da Declan Gallagher sloted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted en la pausa mientras el swap Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, y la pausa accede casi un impacto immediato mientras la victorie sloted in Morelos, pero la impresionante Kelly corrie de la line a block.
But Livingston continued to suck the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long ball up after long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to negate Jacobs before Lithgow went wide from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty while he engaged with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.

Una mujer tratada con la vacuna, que teaches the immune system to recognize cells of rats, observed her cancer ovarian disappear for more than 18 months.
La metodo implica extracción de células inmune de un paciente, alterandolas en el laboratorio de modo que puedan "ver" una proteina común a muchos cancros denominados HER2, y luego injeccionando las células.
Profesor Jay Berzofsky, de US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, dijo: "Our results suggerir que we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drive growth of several types of cancers," incluyendo cancers de mama, ovarian, lungas y colorectal, Prof Berzofsky explicó.
A similar approach of taking immune cells out of patients and "educating" them how targeting cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.

Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.

Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spoof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significations in any new film with a British slant and that seems applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Dodgeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
En cualquier caso, pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has had his license to cock things up for the second time renovated - that name of his signaling more than anything else that he's a wide creation of comics designed for non-inglés-speaking filming territories.
Naturally, he's the daft secret agent who, malgrado his bizarre pretensions to smoothie glamour, has got a little Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the opening ceremony of London 2012 Olympics.
He's also originally based on the traveler and international man of the mystery Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in his awake.
There's one or two nice moments in this latest JE outing.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a middle age dress and the rotor blades clinging shortly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is displayed, but the humour feels pretty subpowered and strangely superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as a ingredient.
Humor se siente como se se lamenta en niños rather than adults, y para mi Johnny English's wacky accidents aren't just as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in person of Bean.
The perennial topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Un cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing identity of all the British agents in the field, to the dismission of the agent on duty - a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a pompous and emballated figure, already suffers a total declanchement of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but there's nothing much in script to work with.
Her Intelligence Advisors informe her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to take someone out of pension.
Y eso significa bumbling Johnny English mismo, ahora empleado como maestro de la escuela en algún posth institut, pero dando off-the-record lecciones en cómo ser un subcover operative: algunos buenos gags aquí, como Inglés ofrece una School of Rock-type academy de spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunid with his ex long-suffering sidekick Bough, play again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, hit to a submarine commander, a roll-hockey-stick roll in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
Thus the Batman and Robin of getting things terriblely wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Entretanto, premiere está falling dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims he could solve computer woes of Britain: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
Inglés y Bough comienzan su odyssey de farcical high-jinks: descuidados como waiters, colocan fuego a un restaurante francês flash; ellos crean mahem smuggling a bordo de Volta's yacht de lujo; y Inglés desencadena pura anarchie como él intenta usar un headset de Virtual Reality para familiarizarse con el interior de la casa de Volta.
All the stops are surely pulled out for that last sequence, but as amable and boisterous as it's, there's quite a little child's TV about the whole thing.

Labour denied it devised plan for Britons to work a 4 days week but to be paid for 5 days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that will see Britons working for four days week - but get paid for five.

Sources said that the idea would 'fit' with the parti economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor de labourers.
Shifting to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit the changing economy.
A senior source of Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "Una revisión de la política se espera que se anuncie antes de la fin del año.
"It won't happen overnight but a four-day work week is aspiration that fit with the approach of the party to rebalance economy in favor of the worker as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such a idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its general election campaign 2017.
Independence is currently not approved by the Worker Party as a whole.

Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy says "60 Minutes" if FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his nomination to Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of the office could distortion any senator Republican Republican to refute their support.

18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge for a new US policy that negates asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives de 18 estados y el district filed a friend-of-the-court short Friday in Washington to support a asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.

US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper launched a four-page ad in a U.S. daily totting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump, US President Donald Trump, u.a.s. on Wednesday said China Daily's payed supplement in the Des Moines Register - state of Iowa's largest sales newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddling in the November 6th US Congress elections, a accusation China negates.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddling in US elections mark what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place advertisements for promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalada trade war that has seen them rounds of level tariffs on imports each other.
China's retail tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, China's and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, ambassador US to China, and ex-governament of Iowa, major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "esta now duplication of that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In disseminando su propaganda, el gobierno de China se aprovecha de la preciosa tradición Americana de libre expression y de una prensa libre colocando un pago anuncio en el registre de Des Moines", agreguó Branstad.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down street here in Beijing, you will find limited disgusting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people might have on the troubled economic pathway of China, given that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, though he no said which newspaper.

Mientras que muchos top Republicans standby y defende Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh frente a varios alegaciones de abuso sexual, analista ha avertizado que verán un backlash, particularmente de mujeres, durante próximas elecciones de medio plazo.
Emotions around this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans are recorded already showing they wanted to go forward with vote.
"Essas cosas can't be gone back," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute push for a FBI investigation would be enough to place voters angry.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, dijo Friday, según Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protestants canted "November is coming!", como demonstrans in the hallway of Senate as Republicans controling the Judiciary Committee chosen to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.

"Pero, it could be higher, particularly among the swinging women voters in preburbs and younger voters, 18-29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimonial detailing her claims of sexual assault against nominee Supreme Court, analists sugerivat a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with confirmation.
"This has become a mudled mess for the GOP," declare Michael Steele, ex-president de la National Committee Republican National, early last week, según NBC News.
"It's just not about the committee vote, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bank, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have handled it," Guy Cecil, director de Priorities USA, a group helping to elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a little more sitting with the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitivamente o probable believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they definitivamente o probable believe Kavanaugh.
38 per cent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitivly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, FBI currently investigate accusations made by Ford as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkly assaulted her a 17.
Ramirez argumenta que Suprema Corte nominee exponental ses genitals para ella while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The Inventor of World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds off the open source platform of Berners-Lee Solid.

In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination."
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store online" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, kalender, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about personal data store online is that it's completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
Idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce of the company, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
La compañía actualmente consiste de Berners-Lee, Bruce, una plataforma de seguridad comprada por IBM, algunos on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, y una comunidad de voluntarios coders.
Start this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt website.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him motivation to become a success.
24-year-old said he no realized until he went to secondary school that "no everyone's like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said to become a parent made him less care about the winning of the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of the disease.
Daley, appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first program, said that he felt "menos than" everyone else grown up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
"He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
"He said he spoke out because he sent fortunate to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who encountered in 2013 - "cache me with surprise."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years old his senior, last year, but he said the age gap never was a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age," - he went to his first Olympics of 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone like age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
"My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."

Daley said his father didn't accept him going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - because he wanted to be on front line.

"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to shit in front of a home crowd at a Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.

American Phil Mickelson will place record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his shape around to avoid it being a unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biannual event for a record 12th time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Rather than being in the center of action, as often has been for the United States, the five-time major winners divide his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in hopes of correcting what's him.
Never the best drivers even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a ideal fit for the stretch Le Golf National course, where the long rough routine punit irrant shots.
Et si la curse en si, Mickelson, in 9th match Sunday, confrontes exact British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
"If the Americans, four points down start the 12 single matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutly crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"Han fully understood the role he had today, gave me a patch on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't want him to play two matches.
I thought it's better, but that's the way it worked and that's the way we thought it's got to go.
"He wants to be there, like all the others."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the altitudes of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, 7 losses, aunque Furyk deklare, his presence brings some intangibles to team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's crazy, he's likes to poke fun with people, and he's a great guy to have in room team room," he explains.
"I think the younger players were fun to go to him, too, this week, which was fun to see.
"Maybe he's more than just playing."
Capitan Thomas Bjorn: "Great lead can soon disappear"
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, sabe de la experiencia, que a big lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily transforme into a uncomfortable ride.
La Dane realizó su debut en la partida de 1997 en Valderrama, donde un lado captain de Seve Ballesteros tenía una ventaja de cinco puntos sobre los Americanos, pero solo ganó la línea de finitura con sus naz frente por la más estrech de margines, ganó 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only only," Bjorn, foto, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
"History will show me and everyone in this team that this is not finished.
You'll go full bore tomorrow.
Come out there and do all the good things.
This is not over until you have the points on board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
"I have said all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Beautiful how his players performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "I would never come forward myself in this.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Tomorrow is the individual performance that comes forward, and that's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested full of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to get to the players, it's the best out of yourself tomorrow.

Contrariamente a Bjorn, opposition number Jim Furyk seeks his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, excepto Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of those great last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before end up a loser as Europe pulled out of the "Milagre at Medinah."
"I remember every fucking word about it," he said, replying in question how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had reunited his players heading to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go down to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.
"When that momentum goes one way, it puts much pressure on those middle matches.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the fightback and face Rory McIlroy in top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in top half of order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn of his single selections.
Germany's new warship is backed again
German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace olding warships Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year due to defect systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", headship of the brand of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-classe frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubled post-delivery issues plagued fate of ambicious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as a replacement for the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aviation and anti-aviation missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar reduced, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long periods of maintenance - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Sin embargo, continuos delays significa que la cutting-edge warships - said permitting Germany to proyecte power abroad - ya sean ancestral until they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
La F125 frigate malfated made headlines last year, cuando la Navy German officially refusó de comisionar la nave y la devolvió a Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that marine returned a shipbuilder to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, pero German media cita una serie de critical "software and hardware defects" que made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly importants, da Baden-Wuerttemberg-klase navies would be operated by a crew of about 120 marines - just half of manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
También, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-clase boats used by the Germans in Second World War.
Apart from defect hardware, the price tag of the whole project - including training of crew - also becomes a problem.
It's said it's got reached incredible €3.1 trillion ($3.6 trillion) - up from initial €2.2 trillion.

Early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chef defensive committee of German Parliament, admitted that the Navy actually "expulse off ships capables of deployment."
The officer deklara que the issue has been snowballed over time, because old boats were decommissioned, but no replacement boats were provided.
He complained that ninguno of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust eavesdrops sobre secret life of bats
New research being carried out at a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shine new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine frequency of bat calls and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior-scale landscape.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of plates and how best to maintain forestry for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout UK have declined considerably in the past century.
They are under threat of building and development work that affects ross and loss of habitat.
Windturbines and lighting can also pose risk, like can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are actually not blind.
Sin embargo, due to their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
they use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.
La organización ha incluso establecido Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, que es home of 8 of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.
"History, we have a great area for bats," he said.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"But there's much about bats that's still not known, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to progress."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within properties, since it is possible unconscient destruction of a single maternity rost could kill up to 400 women and young women, potentially eliminating a whole local population.
Bats are protected and it's illegal to kill, harass or disturbe or destroy their rosas.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in help.

Brexit: UK ‘would ever regret’ lose carmakers
UK "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as world leader in automaking after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
“He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The japanese carmaker said the impact of delays of borders in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - producer quasi 150,000 autos last year, 90% of which were exported to rest of the European Union.
"Mia opinie es que, si Britannia se crashes de EU late mars, vemos stops of production in our factory," affirme Marvin Cooke, CEO de Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how transfrontalier trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, por e.g., says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line se operative "just-in-time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both UK and EU for cars made to order.
"If UK leaves EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with EU "is precisely kalibrated to avoid those checks at border."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say will allow not only the success present to be enjoyed but also to be enjoyed this opportunity," - explique BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"La evidencia de no solo Toyota, sino de otros fabricantes, es que deviamos absolutamente ser capaces de continuar lo que ha sido un set de supply chain de grande successo."
Toyota was incapable of saying how long production would stop, but in the long term, warned that extra cost would reduce the competitivity of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Union Union convenor at the plant, declare: "In my experience once these jobs come they never return.
"We have set a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."

The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless
Alien buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp tax rate when they buy property in UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as a tentative de neutraliser success of Jeremy Corbyn’s drive to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high-ends.
The rise of the stamp tax will be levied on individuals and corporations not paying tax in UK, with the extra money boosting the drive of the Government to combate hard sleeping.
The extra charge - which is in addition to the present tax of stamp, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in second houses and buy-to-let - could be as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to increase up to £120 million a year.
An estimate 13% of new-built London properties are purchased by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for the first time buyers to get a foot on the housing stairs.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend the majority of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson calls for a stamp cutting duty to help more young people own their first home.

"British will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
Sin embargo, it cannot be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in UK, as well as forestry companies based, buying houses as hardworking British residents.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tent Camp in Texas Border
The number of detenued migrant children has increased, though monthly border crossings remained relatively inchanged, partly because hard rhetorics and policies introduced by Trump administration have made it easier to place children with sponsors.
Tradicionalmente, la mayoría de sponsors han sido indocumented immigrants themselves, y han tirado de jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by pasing forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that data would be shared with emigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testificou ante Congress, que agency había arrestado decenas de personas who applied for sponsoring non-company minors.
La agency confirmed later que 70 por ciento de los arrestados no had previous criminal records.
"Aprox. 80 per cent de las personas que son sponsors o de la familia sponsors sont here illegally in the country, y large part of them are aliens criminals.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
Probando de procesing the children faster, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refuge workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than personally, to pledge their case for legal status to a judge of emigration.
Those who are regarded as ineligible for relief will be deported quickly.

Advocats said that these concerns are elevated in a facility larger like Tornillo, where signs that a child is fighting more likely to be ignored because of its size.
They added that moving children to the tent without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could combin the trauma with which many already are fighting.

It's not surprising that the 17th anniversary of Pennsylvania is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realization of a congress districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This recent redrawn suburban Pittsburgh district pitched Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special elections last spring.

The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutively gerrymanded in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th has touched a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impresionant draw in Spain against Villarreal early this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as springboard to greater things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said 31-year-old.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"See maybe we could have made it in the end, but in general, a draw probably was a fair result.
I'm sure they were better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the better side.
I'm going to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but that'll be hard game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push and get a positive result.
"Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but there's a good factor about the place now.
I'm good for the team and the boys really enjoy it; the training is good for the training.
"Hopefully, we can start now, put the last season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement saving fear
Independent from the fact that the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared about, few people were talking about it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care care.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they're not taking the steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance Business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes well known before time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how to take care, since these choices can be a factor important in determining the cost.
Bring to your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid-value life insurance policy to help cover these costs or self-assurance with your own wealth - so long as you have the money.
Hammer out your legal documents: Start legal battles at the pass.
Get a healthcare proxy site so you designate a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are incapaz de comunicar.
Also considere a power of advocate for your finance.
You would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your accounts are paid if you are incapable.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Click on these details in a plan so you'll be ready.
"It's not just the finance that's in play, but who's the doctors?" - asked Martin.
"What's the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan in place."

Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terrorist attack suspects
Federal Procureurs in New York are looking for death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect in the terroristic attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.

It's been a decade since Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penal case.
El acusado, Khalid Barnes, fue condenado por homicidio de dos proveedores de narcotics, pero en definitiva fue condenado a muerte en prizon en September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were condemned for conspiracy to come spying for Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were putted to death by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, un native de Uzbekistan, demonstró falta de remorse in days and months after the attack, according to court documents.

David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We think the decision of seeking death penalty rather than accepting a culpable apelation to life in prison without possibility of release only extends the trauma of these events for everyone involved," he said Patton.
Saipov's defensive team had previously asked prosecutors not to search for death penalty.
