The general player Emeli Kouki, returning from Romania to Finland, was the most effective of the hurricane at 22 points.
There were some troubles for foreigners, but they did not realize, and then a call came from the Creation.
It was quickly agreed, Kouki said.
Tomi Rumpune was played by Loimussaki with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the land-team player Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The win of the open game is always important.
Many players also had experience on the opposite side, and it brought additional extras to the game.
Our game is not ready yet, but the continuation of the measuring pipe is of course the goal, Kouki said.
Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Möttänen was 18 points the most effective of Savo Volley, when the team collapsed with Vanta Ducks 3-0.
Our game was devastating, especially in the aftermath of the attack, but fortunately we got a burdened victory.
At least I had no consciousness of different downloads when I played against my former team, Möttenen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd series in 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was a small atmosphere on the roof all the time.
A good friend stayed out of the house.
Miro was a man, Silli also played a good game, Tuovinen said.
The previous season of the bridge was 2006-07, when he won silver in Pielavede Sammose Tuovise as the main coach at the time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective at 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley star
In the 2012-13 season, Joni Mikkonen won the score score, has also started this season strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening winning after Kokol Tikererit 3-2.
The season has begun very well.
Today, of course, there was a loss nearby because we had four of the loss 17-21.
Something was cut off, and the fifth part came there at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most effective Tickers in the finals, was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Landman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
You just got nothing to pick up the guy's hacker, Mikkonen's cheese.
Finland compares human capital to the world's first
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison to human capital, says Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In two years, Finland was the first of the statistics.
In 2016, it was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands were following Finland.
Later, the Netherlands was located on one of the higher ranks, and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst compared.
Measurement of human capital is considered the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has linked human capital to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois held at Atletico's cruise, local player ended in paint
Real Madrid's painter Thibaut Courtois was a fan of the tournament, and the local match of Madrid teams ended up painting in the late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to painting, but the Belgian guard Courtois began fighting.
Courtois played at Atletic three times as Chelsea's player.
In the beginning of the week, the FIFA International Football Union chose him to be the paint soldier of the year.
In reality, Gareth Bale was the best place to paint, but his defeat ended at the end of the paint.
Bale remained after a break due to more travelling.
According to ESPN, deceived supporters of Real shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus in the match.
U.S. is now infringed against abortion right - A powerful document tells why
The U.S. Senate is trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected by President Donald Trump’s candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh would be revoked against Roe, known as Wade, which made the U.S. abortion legal in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - U.S. and abortion rights tells how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredibly as it feels, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has made public work against safe abortion and has received a wide range of support from most of our country's deputies.
At the beginning of a powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only physician to abortion in Missouri.
The Clinical Army Guard says he defends U.S. religious freedom.
The news video reminds clinics of murderous terrorist attacks.
The time the abortion was illegal in the United States.
The association of Lutheran church leaders then taught women to trusted abortive physicians.
The arguments of the questioned pastor are good, but in fact they are not even necessary, a photo taken from the deceased woman itself is enough.
There were 5,000 deaths in the U.S. every year.
The legalization of abortions was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
In 1967, the Law on abortion was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, specifically, Reagan, in his 1980 presidential election campaign, began vice versa to mix religion with politics to hate voters.
His abortion base also rounded his successor George Bush's elderly parent.
The same was done by Donald Trump.
In the deepest core of the matter, the document overrides the basis for abortion policy.
When tax exemption was rejected from profitable racial separation from religious organizations, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen to be a horse.
Religion has brought to politics exceptional disasters.
In writing this in the U.S., there is a situation in which the votes of religious right to abortion have been embraced by the president as the highest candidate of Kavanaugh, which several women are now accused of sexual anxiety.
Kavanaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children - large protests at the border
About 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year after Israel has fired protesters in the rabbit zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip zone on Friday, the Palestinian health ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 people have been injured.
89 of these were injured.
The Israeli Army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an expression to the rabbit zone when protesters threw Israeli troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has started its use of power that protesters do not break the borders or target it on the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians died in Gaza demonstrations after March, when Palestinians began a weekly demonstration at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Commission, 12,000 people were injured.
The protesters demanded access to Palestinian families to the areas from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
Palestinian striker has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions from the lions and helium balls sent on the Palestinian side have crushed forests and farming countries in Israel.
Theme Pukki gets a punishment bullet - you didn't get shot yourself
Wigan's top couple, Chey Dunkley, appeared to have dropped him back in the penalty area.
Gavin Ward has given the game to continue.
His interpretation was clear.
Theme Pukki couldn't believe in his eyes.
The situation seemed to be disturbed by judge Wardia, who condemned Norwich's 85th Penalty at the time of Pukki's defeat.
Ward seemed to be a punishment, and Mario Vrancic scored 1-0 win.
The buck has made five paintings for Norwich in the Champions League series.
The previous was born against QPR last Saturday with a stylish breast muscle.
Your work was tasteful again for Puck.
When he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paintings and defended without tiredness.
The Norwich match was five in two weeks.
The team continues to move.
Behind the five winning pipe.
Pedophilic assistance is immediately completed with bookings - about 40,000 experiences of interest in children in Finland
According to estimates, 2% of men and a small portion of women experience at least some kind of sexual interest in predecessors.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
To date, children or young people who are sexually interested have been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpon trains professionals to meet pedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was told in the spring, it started in the Sexpo, providing advice and therapy, e-mail call and meeting times were booked very quickly, Yle tells.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
Sexual preference towards the child causes a lot of shame.
Most of the pedophilic feelings themselves have not done their fantasies and have not done anything criminal.
However, thinking is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that bother and depress them.
They also challenge normal life, says Yln, a sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a special expert in the project.
I think work is valuable if one child saves sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Coroan leaders or Congoian gynecologists?
US President Donald Trump is a Nobel Peace Prize winner - the idea may sound suddenly strange, but Trump is one of the greatest favourite winners on the basis of bets.
On the back of Trump’s role in gaining North Korea at least on a national level to engage in the nuclear power plant.
The biggest favourite Nobel Peace Prize recipients are South Korean President Moon Jae and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The heating between the corals is notable, since last year the intermediates were swallowed.
Nevertheless, the award of Kim, who leads to a railroad, would certainly raise criticism for years.
The Nobel Prize winner will be published since Monday, and Friday is the most focused award, the peace award.
If the award is not given to Korean diplomats, one of the senior Congo doctors, Denis Mukwege.
A estimated gynecologist has taken care of thousands of women victims of mass abuse in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has risen to become a leading specialist in the world.
Mukwege has focused on sexual violence, which is a harsh by-product of many conflicts.
He was also a strong candidate for the United Nations Refugee Organization, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Prize Committee said that this year there are 331 candidates.
The names of the condolences are not told to the public.
Trump wouldn’t be wrong if he won the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him if he deserved a peace prize.
"Everyone thinks that, but I'd never say that," Trump said with a smile.
I want to get this done.
The award I want is a win for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korean negotiations.
However, there are things that make Trump’s Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee has often recognized individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and a diverse world order - precisely the international cooperation that Trump has seen as an opponent.
In the 2000s, the award was won by three U.S. politicians who were all Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Trump’s award requires an ideological full translation from the Nobel Committee.
Fire warning in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like cows and went in the wrong direction
One-time traffic gas in Lohi took place on 8 September.
The traffic of the tunnel area has been interrupted due to the notice, both towards Turin and Helsinki.
When it finds out that it is systematic, the fireplace seeks to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the road center said that it could not be opened because the road has a cock and they are driving how it happens, the flaming fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told STT at the time of its freshness.
The motorway was then left to drive even in the wrong direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first begins to act in response to traffic rules, some others often follow after, the contact manager of traffic security, Tapio Heiskanen, is surprised.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels should not be stopped for forced reasons.
Traffic safety reminds us that in exceptional situations it is not possible to endanger traffic with disadvantaged solutions.
Alert vessels must always provide the most impeccable movement possible.
It is particularly prohibited to drive in the opposite direction on the motorway, as well as to make a u-translation as well as to revoke.
The same bans are also applicable in tunnels, in addition to which driving lights must always be connected.
Parking without compulsory reason is also prohibited, as is true, also parking.
In the past, there have been even cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to shake snow from his car.
It should be clear that it is the wrong place and time for this operation, Heiskanen said in a traffic security statement.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration, even though the ship remained on the lake’s ground
Inland water vessels M/S Tampere, the Ilves fans would have wanted to stay on the vessel to continue their victory party, although the vessel had left his neck on the lake’s ground, says Juho Syrj, who served as head of the vessel at the time of the event.
The M/S Tampere, on the journey from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, left his route late Saturday evening and held his neck on the ground with the old water in Akaia.
19 passengers and five crew members were evacuated to the continent at night.
No one injured in my friend.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their holidays on the ship until the morning, but it was certainly more reasonable to send them to the port and by bus home, Syrya told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlin following the match of Ilves and HPK, which ended in the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjan, on Saturday, the friend was due to the fact that the surface of the water was about half a metre lower than normally.
According to Syrjah, navigation was also harder that the nearest sign was in the coverage of log waste, which is why its reflectors did not normally appear in dark causes.
No more mentioned collision
Haveri occurred on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalt shortly after the shipyard had undermined the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The case was not associated with greater dramaticity, according to Syrjan, as the ship’s wave was very low at the time of the event and not caused a more mentioned collision.
According to the exception, the retention on the ground has not caused the vessel's flows or pressures, and the cruises of the vessel's view continue normally.
The sailor went to check the state of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship began to get rid of the sea.
For certainty, we're still going to check that no damage has been caused by this, Syrja says.
Syrjä believes that the next M/S in Tampere, the next weekend, the cross-border crossing can be treated appropriately.
The ship's crossroads continue until the day of independence.
No use for ambulance
The rescue agency received a warning from the incident on Saturday evening after a few and half of the 12th.
Ambulances were warned to take evacuated passengers to the airport, but there was no use for ambulance.
The day-to-day burner Matti Willman said late tonight that the conditions of evacuation in the lake were difficult due to the dark and quite heavy wind.
The Pirkanmaa rescue agency reported on Sunday night that all the vessels were evacuated and passengers were moved by the train to Tampere.
The cruise crew built in 1957 was established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump’s Judge Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Pro
Brett Kavanaugh, who is the judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well remain the role he has to do, said programmer director Mika Aaltola from the Foreign Policy Institute.
At least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual anxiety and unhealthy behaviour at their school time.
According to Altola, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting someone else’s office.
In the U.S., it has also occurred in the past that the president's candidate for the Supreme Court has raised a lot of disputes.
In this case, the judge is usually self-restrained, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The name would be the hundreds of Democrats.
The highest court in the United States seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision is likely to rain by the Democratic Party in the future elections of Congress.
It would raise the voting tension among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest right would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The nomination of secretity does not belong to every presidential period, since in the United States, the Supreme Court judges are named for life.
In practice, some of them have resigned at their own request at ages of about 70 to 80.
Some Republicans also questioned the name
The U.S. Supreme Court’s lawyer will normally make a background explanation, Aaltola notes.
Although Trump has ordered the FBI's extra explanation only for a week, it can still present something important to Aaltola.
Yes, it can bring it.
There is rare smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
It is at least certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inadequacy will be discussed by the official before the Senate makes its decisions.
Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two women's Republican actors are suspected of considering Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassed would be that the appointment would be held in voting and the Republicans would lose.
Women recognized Salisbury's suspected military service agent
The Russian woman told BBC that she recognized the poisoning of Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of a suspected Russian intelligenceman.
Based on photos, the woman said that it was a military interview with Anatoli Tshepiga, who worked in the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia have previously reported that they have revealed another suspected poisoning of men to Tshepig.
Previously, they said they found evidence that the current men's identities are hidden characters.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East near the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga was guarded.
A woman living in the village recognized the pictures published by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man in the pictures of the British police in which he appeared as a man who now calls himself Rusla Boshirov.
Russians are suspected of poisoning the former double agent Sergei Skripalin and his daughter with the Novitshok hermomy in March.
The scraps survived.
Colonel Tshepiga was awarded, among other things, to the Russian hero’s honor mark in 2014.
Russia still objects to the suspicious GRU connection.
The suspects of poisoning reported earlier in an interview with the Russian TV in September that they were in Salisbury as tourists.
Elderly as casting bags in war reform
Now there is a live example of what the change limitation of war reform in practice is defined by the Government of Sipil.
My native region is produced by the Oulunkaare municipality, whose former regional director of health services was elected in 2016 by Attendon.
The leaders of the municipality shall warn the authorisation of the change limiter.
If the expenses of war are now rising, state aids will be cut in the future.
The municipality’s headquarters have stopped, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in elderly care, which would end the institutional care of the Center’s annual health department and the unit of small memory patients.
Home care would be added, which means long-distance travels in Vaala that the elderly living in the outskirts are rejected from the roots to be treated by the health centre as a "house".
Atendo trusted that the city would pay it to its customers.
The left side of the election was not a bad preparation, but organized a good audience, in which many of its own, close teachers and authoritatives of other parties became.
I presented a war-country discussion with the sections of how the elders are treated in the Vaala Municipality at the present time at home in the most north-eastern part of the North.
Carina West was also authorised by the neighborhood.
The local newspaper made a great deal of the opportunity, and it again lifted the Oulunkaar manufacturers to his backbones.
Warmakers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new carehouse for Vaala, which is now waiting for residents empty.
There are no other service providers.
Manufacturers only talk about service services, but do not tell you what levels of care they get or what staff Attende structures will take care of the elderly until accidental care.
Without a nurse?
In fact, the health centre’s facilities are stopped because there is no doctor’s nightlife.
Attende will also be relying on health doctors at the Vala Health Center.
The example of Valal tells you how central officials are rotating the authorized with the most lack of information and the authorized ones are injected against the wall with a change-limiter.
In this way, the Central Party will eliminate the residents of the Vale because who remains unsafe to live there voluntarily if there is a possibility to change.
Was there one of the elections in the city that the whole country would be considered a resident?
Turkey’s President Erdogan opens a big mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people in the city of Köln demonstrated that Turkey’s visiting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened a mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach of the Rein River already in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, he read protesters in the villages, and fascism was condemned in insults.
Several protests have been held during Erdogan’s visit on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were anticipated to protest, among other things, the situation of the Turkish human rights.
The supporters of Erdogan were also gathered near the Great Mosqueian.
However, the police had isolated the large mosque from the security environment.
In an open speech, Erdogan urged his German-speaking ceremony to have succeeded and assessed its strengthening relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday to rebuild relations with countries that have significantly deteriorated since the Turkish revolutionary company of 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disputes between countries, among other things, about human rights issues.
Assessment surrounding visits
Both Cologne’s mayor Henriette Reker and the Nordrhein-Westfalen state Prime Minister Armin Laschet rejected their participation in openings when Erdogan’s criticism of his visit accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told him to come to an Erdogan protest against Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They were arrested, killed, and undermined.
For Erdogan, everything that differ from his own thoughts is terrorism.
At the last stage of Erdogan’s German trip, a significant part of the population in North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
Three accusations of journalist murder in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciaki.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people were accused of Kuciaki and this killing of February and other crimes.

He had studied the relations between politicians and Italian mafia.
Police are suspected of Kuciaki's murder investigations.
The case and Kuciaki published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.

Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Reporter Arto Nyberg is discussing today directly in his future discussion program, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling her space travel that she stole from Virgin Galactic in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which was required to pay with a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been delayed a year.
Now it appears that after a college of failed, accidental, and death sacrificed in 2014, things are in ruin.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at least next year.
The number of Vessa flight is 300, i.e. its journey is scheduled for about the first departure of a year.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and is in a pressing state of 5 minutes at a height of 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut tells about its future homepage.
At the same time, he also reflects the need for space.
When I was a child, I read a series of Space Travel magazine and saw Star Trek TV series.
Star wars have been seen, and that's the idea of it.
Why not?
Everybody has their own minds.
Manchester City was a boring host.
Manchester City continued to lose the game in the Election League, while it collapsed on Saturday at Brighton's 2-0 homefield.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero are the warranty prize for the sixth season of the championship.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Riikkö and surprised Ferrari: "Look a very important driver"
In an interview with Blick, a Swiss journalist was asked by the British spokesman Mersun, does he believe the release of Kimi Räikköse from Ferrari’s services would help Hamilton in the end of the season?
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second score by Sebastian Vetteli's 40 points.
Something less than three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Riikkönen wouldn’t continue on the table next season, while Riikkönen reported his transfer to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't believe that Riikkönen would steal his gloves in the stack.
I don't think Kim's going to change in the remaining cats.
He's an exceptional professional - fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
I don't think that makes sense for me.
Hamilton has previously said that Riikkönen has been one of his predecessors.
I don't know if Kim knows about this, but when I was young and had a formula one, I played the F1 game all day on PlayStation.
I've always been Kimi, which is a bit crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 will continue on Sunday in the Russian competition.
From 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Mercedeksen's Valtteri Bottas is departing.
The evening will follow the cat for a moment.
The A-Young Football SM Series championship became a full farse: the opponent reached the place with only 7 players’ strengths
The top level of football boys ends on Saturday, playing the final round of the season.
Before 13 p.m. of the tournament, the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy is practically enough to score one point against Vasa IFK.
In order to turn the situation back in the last round, the Ilveksen in the second championship must win the PK-35 and hopefully lose the winner.
Nevertheless, the championship of Lahtes was practically secured before the initial error, since Vasa IFK had only arrived in Lahtes by the power of seven players.
If there had been one of the minors, the match wouldn’t have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the 16-0 match.
At the table, the late men led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vaas player’s game is that the team has played the same players in part with the A-Young SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the Men’s Dukkosen C series.
The left IFK has played in the two-season against the fall of the whole season.
On Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK host race and hope that Tampere United will lose its host competition against KuFua in Sicilian Lake Toival.

Serena Williams is annoyed by a video in which she sings in the top-off - campaign for breast cancer information
The tennis superstar Serena Williams is going to get rid of again.
Now he campaigns to raise awareness of the chest window by publishing a video on his Instagram account, in which he sings only his hands in front of his chests, says the news agency AFP.
The Australian Divinyls in 1991 hit I Touch Myself.
The video supports the Australian breast cancer association.
"I heard The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly perform self-controls," Williams wrote in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it, because the subject touches all women regardless of the skin color around the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it triggers a lot of life.
The Divinyls’ second writer is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.

Williams fired the game's headquarters and, among other things, argued that men were accepted much more severely than women's players.
Chinese restaurant in the mountain range is not suitable for high chambers
The restaurant serves magnificent landscapes in addition to traditional Chinese flavours.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in China’s Zhejiang province.
It is literally located on the stone language.
You can see the forest underneath if you want.
Youth landscapes at the heights get the restaurant lazers in the mountains of Longquan.
Access to the restaurant requires a walk in the middle of the cabins.
The restaurant opened for walkers on September 19, 2018.

The Corpel's Juice Ends Tomorrow: So Everything Ends
All good ends in time.
Today, this is what happens to the national landscape drama of Korpela, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched television as their first company.
The tops are no longer practical for themselves, because Heikki Creoman and Jukka Mäkise series are not going to continue.
In the final period of Jaska and Mirku, the mental harp is taken forward again, and Jaska's mother thinks she's the first to see what's going on.
Anss and Miiss are warm, in the light of recent events, romantic, but then the patterns appear again to Laiho.
Police are also suspicious of the bone man.
However, no one can expect your fate in advance.
Anita, however, hears amazing news.
The last will from a distance becomes clear, which brings a woman to the edge of the tears.
After the week, the newest season of Sorjonen will continue on Sundays.
Carpet's sweat today on TV1 at 21:05.
Would you like to go to work with a small flu tomorrow?
This is the facts on behalf and against
The flu season is hot.
A lot of people are going to stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should go infect, because the disease may be infectious, even if its symptoms are small.
Sometimes flu symptoms occur suddenly, sometimes they occur in mucus.
In the last option, you may already infect others, even if your symptoms seem to be small, the Prevention publication says.
Should we stay at home?
According to prevention, flu is infected even when the person itself has no symptoms.
The virus is infected days before the symptoms start and progress from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when your bone is frozen and there is no fever anymore, says Professor Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too quickly returns to the hall to slow recovery.
Remember also to wash your hands, moisture your nose and throw your sleeve papers into the stove.
But painful to move?
If you have to leave home as a sick, consider using the protective machine.
The mask does not like viruses in crisis, but thinks the user is aware of the area of the head.
Then the fingers will not be put into the nose or mouth, Poland says.
The brains are also limited to the machine.
How can we avoid infected people?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, his nose, or wears every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats missile tradition: "My husband is a ice cream"
Ice cream and misses are often combined with each other.
So did Alina Voronkova, 23, also.
In 2018, Miss Voronkova has received the crown of the Finnish woman Alina Voronkova.
The beautiful woman now lives in Lahd, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is an Ingerin Finnish and a Russian father.
My father’s defeat, Voronkova, was tried at school.
Mom and dad have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was tempted because of my defeat.
I had no friends at all in the country, Alina tells me at the release of the semifinals of the Miss Finland Cup.
After the highest degree, Alina decided to start from a pure table and move Lahte to high school.
Soon the missionaries found new friends, and the ark began to roll in a wishful way.
At the age of 15 I think I was an adult, but I wasn’t really thinking about it later.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner Jonas Hurrin, who is known for Pelicans lines.
After the SM League’s career, the freezer has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was a Finnish team in the 18-year-old championships.
In the early days of the meeting, the couple, or nearly a year’s distance, but later Alina traveled with her husband to the world.
If I reached the winner triangle and, with it, I would have a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationships.
Although we have to live separately, then we have confidence working well, and in a distance relationship there is the good side that it will be the beginning of the whole time, Alina officially in May.
Continuing growth joyfully, death in our kinterns
Almost everyone is worried about the endurance of the earth.
However, we don't want anything to give up.
Continuous growth is looking for sustainable alternatives, but reasonable economic theory is also facing the biggest problems.
Continuous growth in the economy has brought to ordinary people during several generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, of which they could only dream before.
Nevertheless, the long-lasting overlap and climate change in the world will threaten this market economy.

One defence error took us a full-size point, Allen's shattered.
Again, we were the best!

The leather looks underpowered, the playground is not sure yet.
Jori Letter's strong underpowering game emerged when his NHL track Philadelphia Flyers played his last exercise before the start of the season.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Letter put Michael Rafflin in two paintings.
In the last few days, Lehrer has been present due to drug suspicions.
The MTV said on Wednesday that Letter is one of 23 suspects in drug combinations, with some suspects in use of drugs and some in sales, for example.
The shepherd has disputed about the crime he has been accused of.
The tracker and player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
The next Philadelphia Inquirer magazine reporter Sam Carchidi estimates after the match that Letter belongs to a group of six attackers, five of whom are ranked in the NHL team.
According to Carchid, Lehtera was excellent in the exercises.
In a second section, Letter fought the knife by underpowering himself, dragging the defender against him, and putting the painting in front of him, waiting for Raffli's open place.
For the second time, the two teams brought the painting at the end of the match.
Flyers will start with a guest match against Las Vegas on October 4, NHL season.

I believe I’m ready for NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview published on Boston’s Twitter account.
In the rivers, Vaakanainen played against Philadelphia for 19:31 minutes.

The new image shows change: The strongest man in the world lost ten pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, the world’s strongest man, is going through a remarkable fashion change.
The British Eddie Hall hunted the world’s strongest man for a long and deliberate time.

Restaurant vessel M/S Tampere rushed to the harvest in Pyhäjärv - "Speakly hold with stone"
Inland water ship M/S Tampere ride on the snow late Friday evening on Akaia in the Pyhä Lake.
The rescue agency received a warning of a water transport accident on Friday evening at 12 a.m.
The 30-meter M/S Tampere ship has been refined to the bowl, and has been firmly attached to its neck with a stone, described the burning fireman Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue agency, personal injuries were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated from the ship.
Now they are transferred by train to Tampereta, the coach Jari Nieminen told STT after one hour at night.
Ambulances were warned to take evacuated passengers to the airport.
The ship traveling from Hämeenlin to Tampere had for some reason been displaced from its route to the west of the narrow Jumusensalm.
Police find out the causes of the events.
The day-to-day burner Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of darkness and quite heavy wind.
According to the rescue agency, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Obviously, the ship isn't going to go.
After the evacuation operation, the deceasers will be initiated to check what the situation is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is currently an indoor vessel with the maximum permitted passenger number of 180 people.
The boat also has a meeting room to rent for private use.
According to the websites of the ship, the cruiser was established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Former managers demand unpaid prizes from Robert Helena
Robert Helenus's night match against Erkan Teperis is shading cash.
Noon-Sanomat reports today on the challenge filed by Jaakko Helme and deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila, in which Greece receives a total of more than EUR 80,000 unpaid managerial prizes for its delays.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Greece 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to agree, but there's no other option.
There has been a clear mission here, and a lot of work has been done, Cokkila tells the evening-Sanom.
Helen’s current manager Markus Sundman sent to Dinnerhead in return, telling about the events of a crashman’s view.
Helenius claims to be obliged to pay the required amount.
In response, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in a financially difficult situation to Greece and promised that they would be able to organize him matches and sponsoring revenues.
It was agreed that Helenius is obliged to pay the prizes only percentages of his matches.
Repeatedly, it was convinced that Helena had nothing to pay, only to receive their organized income.
This is also a normal and unique practice in the management of professional athletes.
The wage has never been agreed, and that would have also been irrelevant in the situation of Helena, Sundman explains in the message he is preparing.
There has never been a written agreement on cooperation.
In contrast, Helenius had initially wanted to agree on the share of revenue, but Kokkila and Sundman received the draft until the end of 2014.
He, on the other hand, pointed to his own proposal as a disturbance and discontinued cooperation with Kokkila and Helmes.
Helenius didn’t even have to deal with Kokkila and Helme.
A year after the completion of the cooperation, the Greeks had been shown a "individual but moderate" account of the manager's work.
This year we have raised the same claims.
Helenius considers the subsequent action of Helme and Kokkila as a cruel act, in return.
Helenius meets today the IBF's seventh-seventh challenger of the IBF series in Erkan Teperin Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio recognized the previous radio drinker and journalist Erkki Pälly for decades.
The long line radio drinker and journalist Erkki Pälli died of unhealthy liver cancer at the age of 83.
The Drinker’s death statement was released on Sunday in Helsinki Sanom.
The announcement reports the death of Päl on 3 September.
He told about a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was then also seen by Ile Vainio, whose knowledge of the fate of familiarity was surrendered.
He’s already left behind on Facebook as an old man, says Ile Vainio.
Vainio considers Erkki Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä Pä
He remembers the man held by Päl, who had quick hockey and funny talks.
I learned to know Erk as a kid when I first visited Finnlev at the age of 12 and started there as a stealer.
We met Erk and I then.
He was then Finnlev's informant and in various tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I progressed to make music producers, there were hundreds of occasions when Erkki Pälli was a standard publisher on all the festivals of talks about artists.
He was always an expert and saw how great a fire he had for fun, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he came directly to his interviewing skin.
He was a hearty man and a good journalist.
Many of them became acquainted with as a radio shower, but he also wrote great newspapers.
He also interviewed me several times.
He was good to talk, Vainio's body.
During the decades, Pälli worked in addition to the reporter work with the Fazer disc company Hoivo Kärje.
He worked as a music producer on Vesa-Matti Lori's records.
However, the greatest passion of the day was the radio work in which he had his own style.
He worked radio since the 1960s, and became acquainted with many listeners in the ether of Yle.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Union announced on Saturday that the financial period ending in May showed about EUR 450 000 profits.
The Union describes its economic situation experienced by "full translation", although the economy is certainly burdened by "a significant debt in balance".
Chief Executive Officer Mika Kulmala calls for a quick response and a strict economic crisis.
We responded to the situation last autumn by taking adjustment measures as soon as possible.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has collapsed throughout our organization, the corner says in the newspaper.
We have also succeeded in the partnership project, and in addition, the world cup’s profits have been the maximum in the past competition.
However, in the future, the management of costs must be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly seek new financial models.
I heard my wife shouting, but then there was silence.
Ten bodies lie on the hospital's backside in the town of the Indonesian Sulawes Island.
Only one building separates them from the area for which the injured survivors are gathered to assess the need for injuries and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside due to successive treatments.
One of the 52-year-olds who moved in the hospital area was Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's gone.
The last time I talked to him when he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who had been injured in his back and arms, was located in the army's hospital's neighbourhood in Palusa.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the wedding party.
I probably had to be pushed under the wall.
I heard my wife shouting, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe, said Haris news agency to AP, according to British media.
Small stores are stolen
At the evacuation center, a 35-year-old baby's mother, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her hot baby.
He describes the mood in the city as a clergy.
Clean water is thin.
Small shops are stolen everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo accommodations.
Although the home would be in some way up, possible post-crash could eventually destroy it and burie the inhabitants alone.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu escaped after the prison walls broke.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there are possibly about 300 escapes.
Some of the prisoners in Dogla have also been injured, says The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners were angry and fired in prison after the guards had forbidden them to leave searching for an earthquake and tsunami-painted relatives.
The airport has been reopened mainly for assistance flights.
One of the first was the C-130 transporter of the army, which brought aid supplies.
Commercial flights to the field Please only are limited.
The airplanes have to land on the ground without the help of the airline, because the airline was damaged by a bad earthquake.
Rain wash at night over Finland
The whole country is spreading over Sunday night from a long rain area to the west, the air science institute says.
Rain becomes mostly a rain, but it is expected to rain or snow in Central and North Lapis.
Backpacks are not repeated last night, as the temperatures under the cloud remain higher.
The darker night keeps the lowest temperatures quite efficiently in the crash.
Just in the west, you can instantly visit the packing side, said the meteor Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday the rain area will differ in the east direction in the morning.
In the south and west there are pounds or semi clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move to the height of Oul at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning of the week looks like the temperatures in the south and middle of the country, but the weather is becoming more instability.
The maritime areas have wind and wave warnings.
True blast storms are not expected for the next few days, but otherwise there is a typical autumn weather variable.
This autumn is going to start to blow on it seriously, I said.

The parents of the new Finnish Miss Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow her daughter’s first moments away from the crown.
They went to the public from Pertunmaa and planned to go home after the final.
There's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result began to be excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inkery and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina also speaks soft Russian, although she has lived in Finland since she was a child.
Svetlana says that Alina was a little more interested in playing and many other things than any career.
Alina was often told that when she was so cute, she should start as any.
But he told me he wanted to be a radio drinker.
Only later, Alina enthusiastized her beauty competitions.
The parent's desire was that Alina would go to university before participating in Miss Finland's competition.
This happened, and ultimately Alina wanted to graduate before the Mississippi.
We asked last year why he didn't participate, but he wanted to make it ready for the candidate.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He is athlete and eats well.
And Alina likes to be present, it will be seen.
Alina’s boyfriend, Jonas Hurri, is working in Japan, and he didn’t get to encourage Finland to love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people lasts a misconception.
Yes, that's the purpose!
The parents hoped that their daughter would come soon.
It has been so long for visits due to Mississippi symptoms.
I'm already missing even though there are messages.

Sari Pippo left his career in Brussels and became a homeland in Finland - I thought the idea of a series: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The most creative was the expression of my husband’s time when he proposed it to be a person in my story, says the Espoon serial blogger, homewife and former EU translator Sari Piippo.
Sari Piippo said he was a EU translator in Brussels as an economic and legal translator until after the fourth child, the family became a returner ten years ago.
I've been really enjoying as a home grandmother.
This has been the best time in my life, but at some point I thought what the big one would do when the youngest child started to be older.
In 2014, the picture became a series.
Piippo tells her that she never had dreamed of making a series of pictures, even though she had read Akku Ankka, Tint, and Asterix since she loved the little one.
I had drawn the last time I was a child, but when these manuscripts of the Most Creator began to occur at that time, the situation changed.
I first made a few dozen manuscripts on the table box.
My daughter, Lavi Whitekama (i.e. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn’t get her attracted until in the summer of 2016, when I gave Lavi with the drawing plate.
His passion lasted a dozen strips, and then had to start trying himself, laughing at Piippo, who tells him that the drawing plate was a great encouragement to him.
The circuit board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
I haven't even tried to draw on paper, Biippo tells his relationship with the drawing that he usually enjoys in the evening.
Handbooks are constantly pop-up in mind, but usually I do not make them at the same time.
One three-square stripper takes even a few hours.
I can make a square at a time and I would like to play with colors.
It is always the hardest to start drawing because drawing is not the strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells his appreciation for the current series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The most creative individuals are the L-theme-shaped porch-trained mother with a salad shark.
Others are Men, Pissis and Kaxoset.
In the most creative world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preach or offer forced bullshit, even if the Creator is going to take a look at it.
Pipipe tells her to read the series with her husband and children.
It’s so nice to look at the series and find out that this is what I’ve done today.
And challenges are enough for homes!
You can read the series on-line at the website.sarjakuvablogit.com
Lotto's million pockets remained on the ground - these were the real numbers.

The second was a baby online player.

Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old airline director of Indonesian earthquake, has become hero.
Agung stayed alone in the airline until hundreds of passengers traveling safely from the island of the earthquake.

Rehn said the end of the trade war in Europe: "We have to look at the next twitter"
The trade war between the United States and China reflects the whole world economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and the Finnish Bank has slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
The CEO Olli Rehn said at the 1st meeting of Yle that although heavily stressed has no direct impact on European trade flows, it weakens confidence, reflecting in business investment decisions.
The situation also concerns exports of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is so far very low.
It has been able to build an intersection with the United States and has contributed to the situation as well as with China and Japan.
Rehn believes that Europe does not appear to be a crushing trade war.
You need to look at the next twitter and evaluate it afterwards.
We have an unexpected partner in Washington, however, said in an interview.
There are also their own risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the largest debtors in the euro area and the entire Western world.
The markets have responded hardly to the Italian government on Thursday evening to show clearly the deficit budget.
In the next year, there is more than 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
Fifty percent of the land’s lending are problem loans, and non-organized loans are more than ten percent.
In addition, its public economy is in weak positions and the country again shows its commitment beyond its European partners.
It may not be necessary to paint new crises yet, Rehn answered when asked whether Italy would lead to a new European economic crisis.
The other thing that is experiencing Europe is the difference between the UK and the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would fit.
The difference between disputes would have much more negative effects.
Rehn began as Chief Executive of Finland Bank in July.
Mario Draghi, Chief Executive of the European Central Bank (ECB), will take his role in a fair year.
The conversation with his followers has begun.
The name of Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikase has been delighted in speeches.
It certainly doesn't matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he wouldn't comment on this longer.

At that time, the presentation has a different content than in the presents.
The lost fungus was found due to an unprecedented experiment
Finnish police drone skills are at the top of the world: "We are asking for training"
According to the director of the Police Mathematics High School, police can use drone in addition to searching for missing people, for example, in criminal investigations and surveys.
On Tuesday, Oulu's police managed to find a missing fungi drone in Raah in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, director of the Police Mathematics High School, tweeted about the case, noting, among other things, that "with an uncertain experience and effective training we are also the top of the world."
Drone is a very new caption and even more new police tasks.
There are no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be a drone master.
According to Himberg, there is a strong concept that this is true.
This has, for example, been solved when the experiences of Finnish police have been reported in international events.
It's very interesting to see it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch Finnish police drone activities.
We are asked for training.
It is more common
Himberg reminds us that finding a lost person in Finnish winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As stated, the missing man was found with the drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drones.
Himberg said they were going to train more.
Now the drone is used in many police tasks, and their use is widespread and growing in the future.
That's what I'd like to say, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for lost people, the police may use drones, according to Himberg, for example in accident or crime site investigations and in certain investigations.
For example, it is already necessary to check a slightly longer area that may be feared that there is violence.
Drone can sometimes be used for a preliminary inquiry.
Karjalan Rugby is a single divarian
Karjalan Rugby celebrates the victory in the moon on Saturday 2nd division.
The Joensuumen were still at the 7-12 match in the Helsinki Rugby Club, but in the second season they found a rage and defeated the 26-12 guests in the south.
At the same time, Karjalan Rugby's 2-division championship recognized the historic rise to the 1-division.
Earlier, the series played in one, but the Finnish rugby series was divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-layer 1-division.
The track is going to receive a series, but it knows a lot of work in the next winter.
The current roster of twenty players who are defeated must be raised to 25.
The 1-division also knows the number of games to grow and long-term games, so the procurement must also be in line with them.
Coaching starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the main coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Ice Creek at the NHL, confirmed the follow-up on Twitter that Finnish attackers Jesperi Kotkaniemi began the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a supermarket in Kotkaniemen, 18, on the first round of the number three in the summer reserve.
The attacker joined Montreal’s training strength from the final stage and presented strong take-offs in September’s training sessions.
The team managed to make the painting immediately in his first training course.
General Coach Julien’s appeal to the Finnish taking large development stairs to the income camp after the arrival.
The NHL series begins on Thursday night against the Finnish time.
Montreal meets the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What is a good leader?
This week, a lot has been talked about leadership in Finland.
In an interview with HS, Nokia’s president Risto Siilasmaa told Paranoid’s optimist in which he explained his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he appreciates his predecessor Jorma Ollila’s leadership.
Ollila strongly opposed the accusations, but in the previous Nokia statements, it has also been discussed about the inability of leaders to act as a team; of fear and speechlessness, which in part caused a breakdown of mobile phone business.
The company's rise risk capability and steadyness will be lost.
The week in Helsinki was also organized by the Nordic Business Forum, which brought to the Messuk Center a business cream in Finland.
In addition to Barack Obama, Lavalle was headed by 12 business stars.
It's enough to talk about good leadership.
Gary Hamel, the legend of the leader, said that a good manager must be afraid to lead the company to the future even when the company goes well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most spiritually linked to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of the wide-ranging Whole Foods trade chain, said that the manager must know the purpose of the company’s entire staff.
And that can’t be just making a profit to the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote about the introverts of the book, said that the most successful leaders are investigated by humility.
They act calmly, quietly and deliberately.
Often they are introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodaran reminded that the characteristics of a good manager must be part of the company’s life cycle alone.
At the start of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A growing company needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These tutorials were heard by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
A lot is required by a good manager.
That’s why leadership is so often defeated, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They talked to each other friendlyly.
However, they wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to evaluate outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on a beautiful red plate directly from Los Angeles - spending most of his bed abroad
Sara Chafak came to the missionary in a beautiful black meal.
In the 2012 Miss Finland showcase, there was also a long breakthrough.
A little bit of a jet.
I came back from Los Angeles.
For a long time I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells his belongings.
Chafak tells me he's been in the Los Angeles trials.
He has made, among other things, advertisements.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, as well as as similar in Finland.
Nevertheless, work needs to be done harder, because the work of the model is always easy to find a replacement.
"I have to push more hard and be aggressive," Chafak says.

The Danish police found a great deal in the operation looking for Volvo: "We can't tell you where"
The Danish police searches have produced the results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was shut down by the Judith Sea and Ison-Belt.
All land and ferry transports from the island of Shelland were closed to Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 in Sweden.
IS was head of the Copenhagen Police Media Center.
The car you were looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found, Henrik Storm told the Copenhagen police about the evening.
According to Storm, the black Volvo has no direct contact with the police.
He says the biggest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told the police on Saturday about information.
Research Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was on the cost of the silent operation.
He didn't want to tell me what criminal name is being investigated.
Skov, however, said it was a "grave crime."
It was a threat to humans.
Three people were searched for in the operation.
Police don't tell if they've already been arrested.
According to the report, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been cancelled.
The Copenhagen police also followed the events on Twitter.
However, according to the police, the large audience is no longer concerned with the threat to certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of divergence - now the people are voting on this matter in controversial elections
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on the proposal for a new name of the country.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Until now, Greece has blocked its veto courts of Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the name of Macedonia belongs to the northern province.
The issue of the referendum does not mention a new name, but is questioned whether the voter supports the Macedonian membership of the EU and NATO by adopting the Treaty.
The vote began closely at least with a school in the center of the capital Skopje.
The retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at school, hoped to support the deal.
The referendum means change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
This means change especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, an independent Macedonia was used in official connections called the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the approval of the agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has once again called for a boycott referendum.
In addition to the result, it is sufficient to stress whether the vote will increase by more than 50 per cent.
Parliamentary votes are not binding, but yes, the victory of votes would allow the mandate to amend the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to amend the Constitutional Act.
The Greek parliament also has to adopt the agreement.
The votes are closed at 8:00 p.m. in Finland.
What a great victory!
Robert Helenius is a member of Erkan Teperin
Robert Helenius met with Erkan Teper in a heavy professional tournament in Germany late Saturday evening.

Canada fights time to reach an agreement from Oil with the United States
Time threatens to end in the free trade agreement between the United States and Canada.
The U.S. has been put into a strike on Sunday, and countries negotiators have been discussing closely throughout the weekend.
Canada’s Chief Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland delayed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations in full.
On President Donald Trump’s request, the United States, Canada and Mexico started negotiations about a year ago for the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached a deal, but the deal with Canada has not yet been born.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force the deal before the Mexican presidential election won by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in early December.
Trump has said that Canada’s participation in the deal is not necessary.
He previously informed Congress that the plans to sign the deal at the end of November - was Canada involved or not.
Due to these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be prepared on Sunday to remain sufficient time for the United States Congress to evaluate it.

Pöytäkivi reassured the SE World Cup of the perforation season, and Laukkanen also swims in the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced in the finals of the 3/7 World Cup in the Netherlands.
Cats are swimming in Eindhoven on a short road.
HSS's Pöytäkivi was shocked by Finland's recording of 50 meters of perforation, where he was the second of the originals at the time of 22,82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swims in Helsinki on the SE-time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing the Espool Ceta, was 24,68 at the time of the 24th season of perfume.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was at the beginning of a 50-meter breast breast at the sixth time of 30.48 and ahead of the final.

Students play a rare taste: an ancient tragedy - polished Oresteia affects visual size
Ancient tragedies are rarely delicious in Finnish shows.
For example, the National Theatre has seen the last ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre High School brought the only remaining play trilogy, the Aiskhylos Oresteian, to the National Theatre Tour.
At Lavy Open! projects starting in 2015, the Theatre College’s actors are working with a professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, as well as the first, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Orestes was held in Berlin in April.
The consensus of Roiha on Oresty summarizes the report about the end of the blood of the tribe of Atreus condemned to destruction and the sin of the rule of law for twenty-three minutes, particularly by stirring the cure shares.
The work succeeds in being very loyal to the spirit of the fine Finnish (2003) Kirsti Simonsuure.
The dramatic lights and the theatre pages reflecting the performance emphasize a solitary and clear viewing.
Its center is the dynamics between the actors who are turning away from the coat, performing nimiroles, and the dynamics between the coat.
The presentation is used for both dual and third-party nominations.
The actors did not leave the show at all, so, for example, Agamemnon returning from the War of Troy and Kassandra’s murders are shown on the show, unlike the ancient performance strategy.
Of course, the presentation does not emphasize that it is loyal to the ancient performance strategy.
Instead, a modern, loyal interpretation for the text is created in the eyes of the viewer, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to show up from the master’s stage of actress students as a tiny group, directly as one organism, a range of rhythms that occur.
Especially in the cure sections, the actors who tend to reach their rights in a very expressive, striking group form, will only be able to adorn their rights by decorating a white precipitation, with a show.
That's amazing.
The performance of Oresteia continues in Kouvolan and Oulun Theatre.
Korean manufacturer prepares its first water load
The newness begins in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyundai and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the partnership agreement published at the Hannover IAA, Hyundai will deliver a thousand new models for the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market, Hyundai continues Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a vehicle manufacturer.
With this quality, the first project in the world will lead us to fuel technology ever longer.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example, by tracking the development of the tank tanker network, In Cheol Lee, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Hyundai Motor said during the announcement of the agreement.
Necklaces flooded several times in Kayana
A man with a little over thirty attacked three men in a restaurant located in the center of Kajan and represented it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed from the site.
Outside he was working on another man's land, and in the absence of a third man's situation, the evildoer also struck him.
Police arrested the injured.
At the police station, the man continued to be aggressive and kidnapped the other police legs.
He also threatened the police by abuse and murder.
The man was taken to calm down.
The case is investigated as three crimes and as a violent opposition to an official.
In the center of Kajan in Välikadu, another accident occurred on Saturday morning.
Two men attacked the victim.
At first, a 20-year-old Cayanist shot.
A little later, another man dropped him into the ground and the man who had previously been shot was still kidnapped.
The outsiders pulled the criminals away from the victim, and the police were called.
The actors may be leaving before the police arrive.
Police asks the eyewitnesses of the event to contact Kajan's police by telephone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail investiga.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
The long line radio broadcaster Erkki Pälli is dead
Erkki Pälli, too long-term journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealthy payment cancer, which he told on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is a cost now.
The doctor said that, I live a day at a time, he commented on his situation for dinner for a month ago.
The safety of trade trails and trails must be guaranteed
For the first time I received a newspaper wage in 1984.
When this yearly tire makes something surprised, it is usually a big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at least a little angry.
I also talked about the work environment expert of the Professional Association of Services (PAM).
He says that criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers, of course, say something else.
The police are just going to see the cases clearly seriously tested, and many of the real violence situation remains unreported.
"Companies have, of course, a duty to statisticalize their situation closely under the labour safety law, but these statistics remain internally used and their data will not be collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries don't get to the statistics.
There has always been a problem with violence that there isn’t always physical injuries.
Psychic traumas can be much more serious than blacks and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation is difficult to draw when a certain level of aggressive threat has to be calculated into violence - even if there is no access to it.
A lot of people are afraid of work, even though real work doesn’t happen.
Some residential areas are uncomfortable.
The store has acquired guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were released, the media also had a significant impact on the security of the sellers.
“At that time, many employers organized guard services for at least nighttime hours to prevent working alone,” he commented.
When nothing happens, we make a wrong conclusion.
This would now seem to have an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the disturbances remained in good possession due to guarding, the imagination emerged that guarding was also unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions to remove expensive guard services.
Slight disgrace is a lawyer’s crime, and it is quite understandable that a misconducted seller does not want to make an investigation of a criminal who usually lives near the trade.
But the same, according to paragraph of the Act of 2011, a mild complaint becomes under the prosecutor if it takes place at work.
Now I think we need preliminary cases.
When the next time the aunt trades or sets her injury, the police should investigate and accuse the prosecutor.
When the court puts a few evildoers in prison, and the sentence from there to the severe stage of the punishment, the habits will be cleared.
A community in which food shops must also be open for small businesses around the night, ensures the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg rejected missile before the start of direct broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
The crown of anybody this year is not a traditional way to see on TV, but the broadcast shows the Viafree website.
Iiro Harjula, former Finnish Miss Heidi Sohlberg, Viasatin and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios.
Backstagen and the red coat designer Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the triangle told the arrivals of invitations and media representatives about the cost of the broadcast.
Sohlberg initially asked the audience to give Harjul aplodies.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this, our man-drinker, Sohlberg crashed his colleague in public hurricane.
It has been followed by many of the past years by Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to them, and Sohlberg also threw a small bitch in both directions.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg would blow to Saro.
More likely, Sohlberg was referring to the divergence of Sieppi, who laughed at the comments, even though he seemed initially confused.
Sieppi talked about the divorce for the first time in the week-end newspaper The Sun.
The missionaries said that they don’t want to open the causes of the difference in the public, because it’s the matter between her and Roope Salme.
He said he didn’t have a hurry to a new relationship, but he plans to focus on himself.
I focus on my own things, especially in the field of living my own life alone, Sarah Sieppi told me.
The matrimonial status of the exercise was introduced even later, when Sohlberg failed to call Janni Hussia and Iiro Harjulaa as a couple.
The three drinkers laughed.
Iron was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussein said to me.
The Northman tortured his binding side by shaking, burning and eating a strong cassette.
The Northern Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man in Kokkola for three years in prison for the crimes he had committed against him.
The criminal instrument was, among other things, the wire, cable, and the nippers.
The court condemned those objects to the state to be lost.
The ranch's charge was suspected of serious rape.
However, the court of the accusation was rejected.
Four offenses, severe offenses, compulsion, illegal threats, liberty crisis, severe liberty crisis, and two injuries were found.
The crimes occurred between March 26 and May 24 last.
At the end of the last act, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Northern Army Court issued its judgment and ordered 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also charged with two serious freedom fights and a serious rape on 22 May.
However, these charges were rejected as incomprehensible.
The case was addressed behind closed doors in the court.
However, the prosecutor issued a public statement of the judgment.
The prosecutor said the accused had addressed his spouse to violence, threats, and force in situations in which this had been bound.
And he who was accused of the sacrifice by a knife, and burned with smoke, and washed a strong box, and washed water, and coffee upon it.
The court ordered the state to have lost the criminal instruments: the cord and the cable, the nipples, the cord of the bath, the knife and the sweater.
Four witnesses
According to the law of appeal, the parties continued to live a common life between the acts.
It is readable that a large number of the most severe acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
There were four witnesses, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old will pay a total of €5800 for pain, radiation, suffering and temporary damage.
It is hard for him to have such money, because he who is condemned is already inheriting his old debtors.
The prison sentence is not the first man.
The nightmare does not tell the convicted name to protect the privacy of the victim.
The new sentence of suffering is not legal when writing this.
Europe leads four points to the Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals arrested their leadership on Saturday in the traditional raid game against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cupia score 10-6 to play in Paris, while the 12 double games are still in front of Sunday.
Europe won three out of four four four matches initiated on Monday, and the four matches in the afternoon were equal 2-2.
The European leadership stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, none of the European pars had overcome.
On Sunday, the two targets more history.
No European player has won five points together in Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have reached three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters to disturb the turmoil in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The HJK football league team issued a Sunday newspaper condemning its supporters’ disruption in the FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the report said.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters ran on the field and some seemed to strive to challenge the dispute with Hongan supporters.
There was also a struggle between supporters.
The organizers did not get the situation calm, but police and racing police were required for the place.
HJK reports that the team’s players and employees are shocked by what happened.
Events after the match are not consistent with the values of our 111-year-old followers.
“We are sharply deprived of all the activities that threaten the safety of match events,” the report said.
HJK allows the authorities and event organizers to help identify and eliminate security threatening factors.
Supporting culture is part of football and important for HJK.
We support all kinds of positive, joyful and encouragement activities in football tournaments.
"Violence does not belong to it," the statement said.
Philippine inventor flying with a drone car - this is how to avoid traffic bubbles
Mendiola is a Philippine inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to the growing world, who swears his invention to fly a car – or at least his own version of it.
As a competitor, he has factors like Audi and Airbus.
Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his property to build his dreams.
She started to develop her car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he said he had made the first successful testing - he flagged on his device at a height of over seven meters.
One of his goals was avoiding traffic threats.
I hope the device will raise positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts: Workfighting will begin tomorrow in children’s daycare and social and healthcare services
In public and well-being sectors, the interdictions of overworking and swallowing will begin tomorrow, especially in social and health services and in childcare, JHL’s President Päivi Niemi-Laine said.
The effects will be widespread, and they will certainly appear in such a way that there is not enough staff in place.
Everybody needs to wonder how to find their children.
The job of the employer is now to make sure that the services are playing and that nobody's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the minority of employees also appeared at the beginning of the year when JHL members were on the basis of the contractual negotiations for over-labour and swap ban.
Employees have made it possible through the flexibility that the staff is not hired, but that the employees have remained excessive or have changed their courses.
This is not a workfighter yet.
It is, of course, a norm for the protection of the work, that every employee should take care of regular working hours and only take care of them.
JHL opposes the government’s efforts to mitigate the resignation protection of small businesses.
Labour market manager Markku Jalonen does not anticipate to assess the impact of overworking and interchange bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very delicate, although services may weaken.
Employees throughout Finland are aware of this and have made their preparations for what is in place.
The area is so extensive, social and healthcare activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impacts can vary very much by sectors, regions and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we have already experienced, among other things, the nearest and basic care association Super and the social and health care professional organization of the corresponding, three-day operations of the Tehyn.
Their effects were very small.
JHL’s interchange between the municipalities, churches, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family-day nurses are limited outside.
At this stage, the work struggle applies to nearly 100,000 members of JHL.
According to Niemi-Leine, JHL’s actions may last for a long time.
The union is also prepared for other workfighters if the preparation of the Refugee Act continues.
The government should now admit that this is running to the wall and hard.
In my opinion, both the Ay movement and the government must be opposed.
It’s special here that the hard is already in the pocket, although the presentation has not yet been given, Jalonne updates.
The Great Corality is born in children's and adults' strength - in the fitness centers of the presentation, we are studying the rice and sea horses
In other rooms, the Great Corality of the group was first in the spring of last year in Hamburg, and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltal.
Like the previous works of the group, the Great Corality is a work that is built from the beginning to the end together with the audience.
However, this time, a clear-minded presentation is also being built, which will revive and rebuild the initial observations made in practices.
In theatre, there is plenty of magic for children.
The view of the child has been taken into account already in the preparation stage of the work.
The Great Corality is still not a childhood, but a presentation made by adults and children in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations about how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw into exercises and joint cuts is also to overwhelm the distance between adults and children.
The Great Corality also resembles some sort of sabalt, fitness and natural subjects of awareness, but ultimately, it turns out in different, non-human conditions around your visits.
The Great Coral Speed begins with the discovery of the corals, as well as the movements of the living organisms and fish.
Six different municipalities are taught, among other things, the rice and sea horses.
Finally, an hour-measured presentation is performed, where music, lights and bright paintings and clothing can help you explore the life of the coral.
In the Great Coral, there are both shocking people watching the life of the Coral Coral and the corals they look at.
In addition, there are organs that look at corals.
The views and findings in many directions make the presentation dense and life stirring.
It is a landscape of a body, a landscape reviewing body, and another landscape reviewing body - and all of this at the same time.
It doesn’t seem to be difficult for children.
In other areas, the group strives to practice the limits of thought and action, which is challenging when the group consists of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the participation of children makes it more important.
After work, the Citrator will organize a quiet demonstration for the threatened corals.
The destructions beyond human understanding should not be allowed to be hardened, even though it could be difficult to understand what the significance of the exercise of your own compassion is in the face of the destructions.
In other areas, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life as well as politically.
There are also other generations, other kinds of consciousness, other species, and future generations whose surprises and cuts it irritates space.
Children grow too fast - I'm happy that there was no smartphone in my childhood
Today’s children and young people are even more responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time as younger and younger.
I think that children should have children all their childhood, and not be deprived of their lives because of the lusts and sex, because others say they are doing so.
I was angry when my boyfriend told me that he had to take her sister at the fifth grade for the weekend with a boyfriend.
When he came to pick up his deceased sister, this told me about his sex experience that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we have been told and warned from all of our childhood that we shouldn't be touched by bullets and sex is the case of adults.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a healthy childhood, and they will not need adults too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I’m constantly seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram who imagine makeup in their name and reveal their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to capture and send nightly images.
Girls are even more difficult to figure out how old they are.
Today’s 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds or older.
My childhood consists of playing in the forest and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have any smartphones in my childhood.
I have been a child for many years, and I didn’t need to think about what others were thinking of me.
Overview: Officials reported to the head of state that the case of Aristote Helmi is not associated with national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, the defence police and defence forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this week.
The Finnish Head of State has been told that the investigation into the Aristote Helmen is not currently linked to national security but to organized crime, reports Yle.
The nominated sources of information were confirmed by the Chairman of the General Defence Committee Ilkka Kanerva (Kok).
According to Kanerva, defence forces and protective police attended this week in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees reporting on an investigation underway.
This is regarded primarily as economic crime.
They were quite strict because they did not speculate that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented in the interview of Yle.
According to the above, there has been no evidence of connection to national security in the rear-breaking material so far, but the investigation is only under the control.
We can’t even know what can be revealed from there, one of the most interviewing facts.
A week ago, a wide range of homes started on the island of Turku and on the continent have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely a threat to economic crime or a threat to Finnish internal security.
The evening earlier this week, a matter of discussion was made on both sides and against the arguments.
Video: Dreamy rescued the lost series of Liverpool
Liverpool's 100 percent election league started, but it was still more satisfied with the 1-1-level team at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be the same year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and fled to the 1-0 tournament.
Then Pep Guardiola’s combination sent the entire Valiolian League a signal that City was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And surely Liverpool’s manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived at the same time in West London.
The Reds had begun with the sixth consecutive victory in the Valiolian League.
Liverpool began stronger, and in particular Virgil van Dijk felt ruling alone in his own field.
On Wednesday, Chelsea had a great guest winning at Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange banks to resolve the match with a wonderful individual direction.
Now, of course, Hazard has been with him right from the beginning.
In 25 minutes, he first played a ball in a small way with the triangle, Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard jumping forward and sent to this perfectly emphasized cross-border.
Hazard headed a little over the penalty area, but bombed from there the perfect left foot to the back corner of the bet.
Half the brassman Alisson was slightly slow in fighting and did not get his fingers into the ball.
Klopp certainly felt the loss station slightly unfair, as Antonio Rüdiger was nearly immediately following the control of Mo Salah.
During the second season, the Chelsea wizard Kepa also came into action.
The baski suit quickly reacted to the veto of Sadio Manén and threw the ball from the root of the ball into an angle.
On the other hand, Alisson zeroed by throwing through Hazard.
The best place for visitors came at the 72th minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmin's center.
Nevertheless, the Brass Star pocket was directed towards the teammate David Louis, who rescued the host’s leadership station.
It didn't last for the 89th minute, when the replacement guy Daniel Sturridge could freely shoot at 25 meters.
Sturridge played at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of an irresistible bet at the top.
Liverpool's 100 percent league start ended with 1-1 level, but it's still in league run - together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also strictly involved in the championship camp of two points behind the top.
The clock transfer centers are deep
I remember a decade ago, when a magazine asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Virgin's answer remained the only one in mind: the end of the nose.
Some names have a nose end and some are not.
You can get to the square wherever you are, and here was one of the suppliers.
Finland has been able to resign from the annual clock transfer in the EU.
Very many agree that clock transfer twice a year has been a fool thing and has caused a variety of problems.
Finally, this achievement feels at least the easiest step in the solution in Finland, even if it has been easy.
The most difficult is now to resolve what time it finally comes to: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to say their opinion on taketa.fi.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open on Friday, October 12.
The discussions are held hard on coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has a word to say.
The reasonable influence of the morning light on the well-being of people and the summer of the evening on the outer and through the well-being of people.
Both sides have strong supporters and good grounds.
According to research, the morning light rhythms the day of man and gives rivalry.
On the other hand, if you do not suffer particularly from awakening in the dark, it increases the light of the movement of people outside and provides better opportunities for autumn areas, for example.
The amount of extra light after a normal working day has already been calculated for an hour.
I'd rather take both of them, but we're not able to do anything bad to our location in the northern part of the world.
Winters are too dark and summers are too light for many in any case.
A typical topic for discussion is that our own views are driven and the other views are very strongly opposed.
The arguments of the counterparty are not just listening, because the main thing is what it feels about itself.
Because almost everyone finds an opinion about it, it’s somewhat uncomfortable to try to turn one another’s head.
It's going to get rid of it.
The subject is a terrible simple argument, because it does not require great insight and sufficient mutual awareness to be justified.
Otherwise, the same kind of matters are generally disputed more hard and equally infertility.
It's a bad thing if the wrong option is chosen, but it doesn't fit.
And always it also offers a suitable sin puppy if life feels loud.
If he fought a guest winning
Josba's first guest game in salibandy Divar produced three full series points against Nurmon Jymya.
Josba left Seinä River for a home trip with a smooth 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo still painted at the beginning of the third part, but Josba asked for compositions and recycled men in chains.
At the time of 50,47, the brothers Ethu and Juuso Lehtiniemi had a 6-5-winner mall.
In the ice cream of both teams were played decisive minutes on the Republican station.
The most effective of his life was Juso Journalism (2+1).
The two-chain was fire-powerful, otherwise, when Teemu Tukhane (1+1), Jere Kartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also participated.
Mika Kosonenken (1+0) played at the time of his birth also in the two-chain.
If you have three series rounds, you have six points.
The next O2-Jyväskylä will be in the guest in two weeks.
Enon Church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Enon Church will be held tomorrow on Sunday in part in very sad moods.
A week ago, the destruction of the church was shocked.
The churches were guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the sadness, today is still a place for the party.
Although no one would like this, the Church of Enon is now the elder of the Joenus Church Church.
The church in the middle of the village has always had the heart of Eno despite the municipalities and other associations of the world.
The family starts at the church of Enon today at 10:00 p.m.
He then moved to the congregation to the cattle table.
The program has all kinds of indoors and outdoors for a long time.
For example, the church building can be found with the teaching of Ari Räsäse, who has been retired for 37 years as a church master.
The church’s birthday also means the end of one time.
It was already disabled, the house of the congregation built in 1982 keeps its door open today for the last time.
We are now at the former municipal house, says the Cappacian Markku Koistinen.
The companion’s house has destroyed internal air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy place for the last 200 years.
Elon Musk defeats Tesla’s head of speech – fraud charges were agreed with $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have agreed with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
SEC suspected Musk's accused of securities, and Musk was in danger of being dismissed due to the company he founded.
Musk can continue as Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer.
Instead, Musk must claim to be the chairman of the Tesla government for three years.
The company will have to hire a Chairman of the Foreign Government.
Musk will also be more strictly controlled.
According to the agreement, Teslan must hire two independent leaders and further monitor Musk's communications in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk cost both $20 million (about €17 million) to adjust the case.
“The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and disadvantages for Tesla’s shareholders,” said Steven Peikin, director of SEC.
The case began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might withdraw the company from the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the funding of the company is secured.
The twitter instantly raised Tesla’s share course.
SEC suspected Musk's accused of securities.
According to the agency, Twitter was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about an arrangement with the company's other manager or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
SEC announced on Friday that it challenged the company and Musk’s justice.
SEC said that Musk would be sentenced to fines and prohibited him from acting as a chairman of the stock exchange companies.
SEC’s challenge was cut by investors, and Tesla’s shares declined strongly.
More than 800 people have died in Indonesian strike and tsunamis
During the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis, the number of deaths has increased to at least 832, according to AFP.
The number of deaths is believed to rise, because the destruction is amongst them.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final number may rise to thousands.
Friday's earthquake raised a tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was issued immediately after the injury, but it was quickly cancelled.
According to the officials, almost all the dead known to be known are at least from the Praise.
The rescue authorities are worried, among other things, about the Dongala region, near the centre of the plot, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Many people are already known to be dead.
Destructive Assistance Requests
The Indonesian army has been warned to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the devastating area today, invited soldiers to continue their rescues without exclusion day and night.
One of the centers of rescues is a hotel located in Palusa, whose ruins are still believed to have 50-60 people.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, said that one person was lost in the night of the Roa-Roa hotel’s favourite ruins for business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he told me.
According to the Swage, severe rash furniture would be rapidly swallowed to the sphere and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing relatives.
Help, you in Palusa and in the vicinity.
My friend is still missing, one writer was attracted to the Facebook group.
The numbers of politicians in the hands of disturbances in the UK
Many British politicians were subject to disturbance when their contact information was disclosed due to the deficiencies in the encryption of the app.
The disturbances were accessed, among other things, by the Minister's telephone numbers.
This was the application used at the British Conservative Party’s Assembly in the Government.
For example, Brazilian Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were undergoing disturbance.
Several deputy members received disturbance.
Due to the encryption deficiency of the app, the public accessed the profiles of the politicians who were at the Conservative Party’s Annual Mobile App.
The public accessed profiles using the policy email address, which was easily accessible online.
The profile login was able to check and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone succeeded in turning Boris Johnson's profile picture into a porn picture, and I titled it into a shameful.
Michael Goven's profile image was exchanged by media module Rupert Murdoch's image.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows access to other people’s profiles by these email addresses.
The login can then view the contact details of the profile and otherwise send messages on behalf of the profile.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant’s telephone number public, Foster.
The Secretary of the Conservative Party apologized for the release of the information.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority ICO supports data collection.
The app was created by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The working party in the opposition appreciates that the conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland's public has a large group of Polish disguised each week
The eye-catching viewers focused on the reactions of The Wall Finland visa program in the studio community.
The rapidly spreading U.S. format The Wall ran the Finnish version for Nelos last Saturday.
Heikki Paasosen host game show is described in Poland in the same studio, where the format is also made by other international productions.
In the Polish studio, the descriptions were exceptional, as the size of the 12-meter-high format required space from the space.
During the early period, on social media, a studio studio was introduced in Poland.
There will be a discussion on Twitter about whether Polish sitting in the studio might be able to understand anything about the game playing in Finnish.
Chef of the National Programs of Neopoly, Unne Sormunen, will illuminate the matter for the evening.
He tells us that the studio has close players, other Finnish, foreigners living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The public is composed of international dishes in the production of Finland, as well as the publics of The Wall periods described in the same state of production in other countries.
Even in Finland, there are such bowls, so-called professionals who visit the descriptions of different programs, the Ring reflects.
He reminds us that tracking the game itself is not so difficult, even if he doesn’t understand the language that plays it.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
However, the foreign-language studio has interpretations that take care of translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the simultaneous interpretation of events to the studio manager all the time.
And the studio manager then instructs the audience and tells them what they are going through, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation to how David Hasselhof was later delivered in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff participated in Talent Finland’s descriptions a few years ago in Finland.
He always had a simultaneous interpretation in his ear and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish, the amount of Sormune.
Southern Japan's broke taifune moves towards the main island - authorities warn about land floods and floods
The authorities also warn about possible earthquakes and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuni Tram, but large injuries have been avoided and there is no information about the deaths so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned the cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to protectors, and electricity has broken down from more than 300,000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and rail trains are the most located in stops due to a storm.
The storm is expected to strike nearly half a day in the time of Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the way to the storm, but it also allows for heavy winds and rainfall.
The juveniles have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to scientists, Trami will torture Japan until Monday.
The heavens of the Asians are still in my sink
The early season of Asia has been bad.
My sky is almost long enough, when the team lost on Saturday at the home field for Vaasan Sport at 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses, and a total of two points in six rounds are in cash.
None of the Asian defenders or the player of the two lower chain has yet to paint.
The pressures also grow all the time.
At the time when the game remained half of the game against the audience, your boyfriend was already in charge of the sport.
Six games are only played, and of course there is no reason to give up.
We have to be careful, because we have saved it weakly.
In particular, the second series was a shame, and the 1+2 acts made to Axs, Jarno Kärki told me.
The win for sports was naturally tasteful.
The team had the game under Friday, so it would have been thought to appear in making.
Maybe it's been seen, but it wasn't possible to take advantage of it.
The number of visitors on the Day of Bread continued to grow
The Mother of the Feast Day, Pirkko Hirrine, wonders the number of publics of the event in the large room.
He thought that this year couldn't have so many people, and that this morning he thought.
In autumn 2017, with the Bread Day, SM competitions were organized at the same time, so maybe the expectations would be that the public could be slightly calculated from last year.
Otherwise, however, it occurred; the visiting taxes were already mature before ten years, the sellers reported that the products were over, the news site was previously sold more than 500 doses, and even the number of cars was heard of an increase.
The number of visitors has been estimated to be approximately 6,000, according to Hyrinen later in the afternoon.
At 5 p.m. and 5 p.m. there was a lot of program for children, which would probably attract them to the recording room.
In addition, it is estimated that the event will be achieved even longer.
The sellers also travel to Liperia every year from the larger area.
This year, the sellers of reporters, craftsmen, seeds and harvest products had arrived nearly one hundred of them.
The Mother of the Feast Day PIrkko Hirrine admired the audience with regard to the room.
At the beginning of the day of the feast, the fruit was blessed.
In the children’s series, Teija Kvinemen’s beautiful bread won a public vote.
There were 11 different forms of bread for children.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Ruisle Competition, spent the day in the martial camp of martyrs.
7x the most beautiful lamp - this is what you recognize a good lamp
Wake up a space in the soul, create the right mood in the interior and read the book of the eyes without being tired.
Good lighting is worth paying.
We gathered together three good reasons to put on the lighting.
Tips were given by Innolux, Director of Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Make a favor for your eyes
The importance of lighting is increasing, the more ages are behind.
With sufficient light, it can help with problems that many come with age as the accuracy of vision decreases and more and more suffers from anxiety.
Parents also need light to grow.
The sixty-five needs light three times more than the twoty-five.
Therefore, on the effects of light care and the characteristics of the lamp, it is worth paying for health.
Good light gives enough light, but it doesn't bother, Jokinem's advice.
Create beauty around you
Beautiful interior can only be displayed with right lighting solutions.
The designer of this moment has to choose.
It has a Japanese style that combines unreliable, Scandinavian and Japanese style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, which has been inspired from the 70s, has risen to bum with its strong colors, different metal nuances or ice colors.
The truth is the same as in the interior of the house.
The materials now appear in wood, concrete, ceramic, paper, leather and bamboo.
Explain your personality
On the other hand, it is now being paid more than before, and from the interior it has become a way to express itself.
Instead of making mass, you want to be customized, brave lighting with a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let’s be very aware of the design, Jokinem says.
Not necessarily at home you will get the latest trendy light, but a timeless classic for which you have been saving for many years.
Some kinds of unforgettable, decorative and elegant classics like their surface from year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and see!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games
The size of Brendan O'Donnell and the attacker's roads are going on.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three Liga matches in oranges, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell transferred to KooKoo in August by a one-year agreement that included the duration of the test at the end of September.

The player wants to show an example in recycling - goods go to the world in recycling boxes, plastic turned into paper
The game’s special movement Player now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the stone shop customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper boxes made from recycling materials.
Products ordered from the online store are packed, for example, in packs for importers.
All the packages that come to us will be reused.
We can use boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in a position to use it, says Ville Puurala Oulun Player.
As a soft material, the company generally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
Copper plastics should be avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we should also move to recycling materials in the carriage.
Movement wants to show an example to others as well.
Rotating is not an extra effort, according to the tree.
There is no big problem starting to recycle.
It will also be economical savings when, for example, cotton packaging is used for new use.
The rotation is naturally suitable for the gameplay, as, in addition to the movement of new products, the main product range includes the games and equipment used.
Each fashionable procurement: One and the same shirt works in every device
Classic dresses work from season to season in a different position than in a position.
They create the foundation of a good wardrobe with a multifunctionality, as it is easy to collect various residents in a low cost way around high quality classics.
The most used classics of the dressing cabinet in autumn are high-quality needles.
This category also includes a black pool.
Black necklace made of natural materials with semi-collars cannot be a miscontracted.
Clothing can be combined with both direct pants, cheerfulness and jewelry, and around it can be created in the style of both the size and the style of the bulk.
Pooloneule is suitable for both young modern dresses and classical elegant style arts.
That's how you create a style.
In the autumn, the trend is produced from golden and wide layered vacuum cleaning houses, black pool leather and grey nipples.
The classic poolone, along with other classics, blue-green scots and wine-red loafers, forms a female and finely decorated habitat.
It brings the shade into the black pool with its trendy clothing: jewelry, high soaps and thick shoes.
Young and stylish!
Russia’s sabotage services have a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the foreign inquiry of the Russian Federation SVR or the military inquiry of the GRU would have resigned from this practice.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyvatelna group: sabotage and questionnaire group.
Officers working in the western KGB Security Service have prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports archive manager Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The objects were ports, telas, large trails, oil productions and gas pipes.
In Germany, the KGB acquired DRG groups for coating units and units for Bundeswehr, railroads, cross-border guards and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian counterparts in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed in the local equipment of the Ukrainian police, founded an inspection station for you leading to Ukraine and separated their homeland from Crimea.
The agents of the Cold War threw sabotage groups into the ground of accessories containing mines, explosives, attackers and message equipment.
Even in 1998, the KGB was found in Switzerland, whose anesthesia was exploded when the authorities injected it with water.

Tositary on TV today: The mirror was left to death twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experience.
The film was made on the basis of them.
Everest gets his first night on Finland's TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snowstorm surprised the killers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 guidance tells about the survival process, which has been treated with grain.
The tragedy has been filmed - and documentaries - before.
Truths are also going through in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took 22 years ago the life of eight killers.
Two of them were experienced tournaments managers: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
The Hall was the Weathers guide.
Weathers' life could be rescued by an eye cutting operation carried out before Nepal departure.
As a result of it and the air pressure, he lost his vision, which is why the top conquest had to be stopped.
Rob Hall stayed on his way and didn't come back again.
However, Weathers’ struggle of life and death had only begun.
When the storm rose, he disappeared and no longer found back to the camp.
When the man came to search, he was found in so bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers were left to death.
But as a miracle in the shop, he still got his legs and found others.
Unfortunately, Weathers thought he was still going to die and once again he was left in his own luck.
In contrast to other expectations, Beck Weathers remained alive.
At some point, the mirrors began to believe in the possibility of helping him.
In the film, Beck Weathers is presented by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is celebrated the 200-year-old church of Enon.
The 200-year-old church of Enon is celebrated today in the church.
The church was inaugurated on 4 October 1818, and the celebration of the year was prepared for the celebration of the whole family.
The feasts began at the church of Enon at 10 p.m., after which there was an antimicrobial flock table at the church house of Enon.
The church was full.
There were 517 members of the family.
The Church of Enon, Armi Iron Mountain, was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time and gives strength to work, Iron Mount (in picture) says.
The fire of the heavily threatened church has been touched by many, and it was not abandoned at the 200th anniversary of the congregation of Eno.
The Church of Enon is now the oldest firefighter of the Church of the Evangelical Philistines in Joenus.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the early morning, a harvest took place, where the church destroyed in the fire was recalled and remembered.
Photographs and videos: The Medican resigned its land in Greece - The Sea disappeared and the street turned into a river
A powerful hurricane-type syysmyrsky broke from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The intermediate hurricane is called Zorba.
The Greek air science facility has provided a red weather alert to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, the Ionian Islands, Kyklades and Crete.
In the pictures taken from the area, there are plenty of floods around Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how the houses in the city of Kiao, Corinth, suddenly appeared on the streets rather than on the river because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has become transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of Peloponnese, the hard wind caused a strong sea ride.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for monitoring weather notices and local authorities’ instructions.
The intermediate hurricane, that is, the medicine, brings with you toss and even a flood danger.
According to a 2011 study published by CNN, medicines appear only once or two years worldwide, typically in September-October roads when sea temperature is still high.
The storm left a flood in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and Europe.
Treatment in Greece has also caused refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps are limited.
The storm also remains under the storm in the summer, devastated areas in the surroundings of Athens.
My medicine was also in Greece last November.
Now you don't have to go to the sea, yet your flights are still on their schedule - with the threats of a storm on the islands of Greece, thousands of Finns are currently on vacation
Travels to the sea are cancelled and even walking should be cautious not to fly on the storm with a bush or other debris.
Such instructions have been shared in fairness in Greece through the Sunsets for a holiday in Finland for the weekend.
Instructions are needed because even the horrific storm of Zorbas has been predicted that the Greek island will be overwhelming this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wind speed can rise in the woods up to 45 meters in seconds.
There is an increase in the rainfall of hostility.
All travelers from Greece to Tui who have notified their phone number have been warned by the travellers through the Sunsets and Tui by a text message.
In the air, the sun and the heat
According to Inka Ikosen, the Sunshine Communication Expert, the holiday destinations were avoided from the worst by Saturday morning.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to the normal schedule.
Of course, we're keeping the situation track all the time.
Security is going ahead.
I supported media fans Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also passed on the schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff at home.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the beginning on Saturday.
There are currently a total of 1,500 Finnish travellers on the most popular islands of Greece, namely Rodox and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers leave in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos will reach on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodox had flashed the sunlight and temperature pain to 27 degrees, according to the Icon of the Sunsets.
Zorbaksen has been estimated to be the next move to Turkey, although it is slightly relieved.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and, for example, checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya, says Schroderus.
Shirly Hair and Janni Huss fully identical evening dresses in the missile - so they react to the situation
Media character and fitness coach Janni Hussi arrived at Miss Finland’s final on Saturday in an open evening dress.
Hussi says he's got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the show and decided to rely on professionals who found me quite a beautiful dress tonight, Hussi smiled.
The same silver evening dress was also chosen by Shirly Karvinen.
Two of them also noticed similar apartments and treated the situation laughing.
Karvinen told him that he was in an urgent preparation, and he was forced to land on the plane.
Hussi serves as a backstage and red carpet drink in the missile, and he talks about the most prominent stars that come to the place.
Huss has a fresh retreat behind him because he moved from Camp on Friday to the Waste Island
I'm going to stay there so far, let's see what's going on.
It's important that the new apartment has its own work room, Hussi's house.
Before he moved, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was nice, I was just in the hotel for a week without leaving anywhere.
When stress broke out, I got flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen's use on the plane drew a lot of attention - collected a retreat for retirees
Drinker and 2016 Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told Miss Finland's final on a red plate she had enough to do with radio and Love Island Finland's descriptions.
The speed is even enough to reach the final of Karvin directly from Finnair.
I make and put my hair on the machine.
This is the glamour.
A dinner change at home, Karvin's laughter.
Karvinen tells her to draw her makeup among retirees.
I also attracted the attention of travellers to preparing for him.
I had a big mirror and so mirrored people's eyes.
My makeup was interesting at least in the minds of others.
Karvin is flying to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, she spends a few days at once.
Karvinen tells her to enjoy her plague as a Finnish singer of Love Island.
He describes his experience so far as to stop.
Karvine says she's going to take off the show on Friday.
It's somehow really raw.
They are real emotions of people, Karvin describes the emotions of the program's zinc.
How do I dress over-generation apples?
Three perfect examples
Classic dresses are shoes that work from season to season in a place other than in a place.
The classics are often decades-old, but sometimes the most modern individuals are able.
Several years ago, the hips of September and Winter have not gone anywhere.
According to its name, the top of the knee are repeated in stylish seasons from year to year.
Showing sharks share the views of users, but the brave model is worth trying, no - brave.
In fact, over-generation soaps are actually suitable for any habitat size.
Whether it’s for jewelry, pearls, boring or trick, the leather or work leather symmetry is working.
Long shoes look good both in the party classes and in the archipelago.
Black over-generation apples are very suitable for the size of the hemp.
They adequately balance the femaleness of pink, any plunger, and pepper, delicate needle.
A beautiful but stylish, autumn archipelago for romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro-enabled habitat is generated from a long copper-brown mixture, over-generation mixture, apparent ear shoes, and nits.
Although there is a certain subtlety in the super-generation shoes, they are also perfectly suited for relaxation with t-shirts, long shorts and a trendy sticker.
Very easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start running in Espoo
They operate during the end of the year and take passengers to the road, the city of Espoon informs.
The Otanime robotic cars are in the role of a bus simulator, as the next spring area is intended to launch traffic with a robotic bus.
The project develops and pilots robotic vehicle traffic throughout the year and tests the technical functionality of the vehicles in Finland’s circumstances.
In the experiment, you will find out how robots can manage on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robotic bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, said traffic manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, robotic cars are fully automatically running among other transports without special transport arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always responsible for the driver’s safety.
Vehicles feel their environment all the time with a variety of sensors and evaluate whether the driver is free.
If not, they will interpret whether an obstacle has been detected by a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowboard, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars run through the entire autumn three days a week: Tuesday at 13-15.30, Wednesday at 10-15 and Thursday at 10-15.
Robots stop by six stops on the road and take passengers to the road.
Robot car stops identify stop markings.
More securely, the stop number 1 on Otaka Island will be reached.
The Mokoma Bassist fell in the lake between the cake and injured
Mokoma’s company informs on its Facebook page about the surprise situation in the Tampere Paket Room.
The Mokoma group’s coupon at Tampere’s Package Room was dramatically reversed on Saturday, when the band’s bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell to the edge of the existence.
The situation happened when the band was in the last piece of the night.
The horrific rain broke.
The band will inform you about this on its Facebook page.
"We're in the spirit!"
Late last night, he was in the Packaging Room and broke his beach.
Hopefully a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the circle are treated with a reservoir, on the pages read.
Many fans are concerned about the photo update, where the Bassit-Santtu lays a kid in his hand on his bed.
This news was expected, it was very hard to worry about how bad it happened.
The ease is great, the bones are improved over time.
Chomps and fast recovery to Santo and a good tour on another band plus to the shooter!
And thank you for yesterday, the wonderful thing was, but would you promise to continue to leave such a strong drama from the end of the puzzles in the future? writes a fan.
Police watched hunting in North Karjala and Savo
The East Finnish police agency conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forest Management and Finnish rape center in North Karjala and Upper Savo, police officers reported on social media on Saturday.
The main weight of the supervision was in the legality and permission of hunting.
Each hunter has been checked for hunting cards and the country requires hunting permission.
In addition, the ownership of hunting weapons and the allowances of self-loading weapons used for channelling were reviewed.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the control, and only one hunter was found during the control, with no hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned 12 packages per day for an unauthorized request.
In addition, 133 drivers were fired by the police, and two of them were suspected of beverage.
In addition, the parties discussed five traffic infringements in the penalty procedure, police once.
In summary, hunters can be found to comply with the permit for hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by control.
A hunter said that "I have hunted in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the licenses."
The East Finnish police agency will continue hunting monitoring in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the Syrian quota pope's choice
Interior Minister Kai Mykkäne will travel to Turkey in the next few days to follow the selection of future quota champions in Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkey’s refugee camps.
Election trips are usually carried out several times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Business and police.
The delegation is currently conducting interviews in Turkey.
UNHCR first selects people who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be refugee camps in a particularly urgent position, such as single-care families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are elected to the future group of Finland than the quotas exist, because in practice some remain unreliable for different reasons.
Mykkäne also meets the NGOs operating on the Syrian border with Turkey’s Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu.
In addition, the National Secretary of the Interior, Ilkka Salmi, is also involved.
Speaking of the increase of quotas
Finland has taken quota colleges since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was for a couple of years in the year 1,050, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The coefficient has supported the increase of the quota, but the project has last fallen into the blue counterpart.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkäsen’s visit will be the first to take place by the Interior Minister to monitor the selection of quota scholars.
The former interior ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risiko (co.) could move to their new tasks before the visits were held.
Finland receives aid of EUR 10 000 from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to searches - I don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore
The poultry news last Saturday about a draft law to amend the animal protection law.
The article found that the draft law initially prohibits the holding of all animals which are not separately permitted by the ministry regulations in relation to production animals, pets or other businesses.
Therefore, all other animals shall be originally prohibited except for the animals referred to in the Regulation separately.
If the bill ends in law, it means that we are rejecting the general principle that the law separately prohibits action that threatens society’s security or good way.
We are now in principle to regulate the prohibition of all activities that are not permitted by law or regulation separately.
This change causes no new experience, for example, in business operations, and does nothing else until the adoptive law or regulation has been adopted.
The government’s work has generally been weak in the preparation of law.
If we are now going to see that in Finland, in principle, everything is forbidden, which is not separately permitted, we no longer know whether we are crying or laughing.
I do not doubt that the animal protection law requires an update.
But this policy does not belong to democracy.
Unfortunately, I don't feel very well with the Constitution, but can it adopt such a "everything that is not permitted by law or regulation separately" procedure.
Hopefully there will be a reasonable minister who will stop the progress of such a bill.
Metti Forssell Tip: Autumn Four Trending Hammers
The trend of this autumn will be in the snake season.
It looks particularly good in the sharks.
Combine the dragon-mounted shark to the upper sides, such as the pool or the usual t-shirt pair, so that the population remains stylish.
This autumn, the silk is widely seen, and especially the silk is one of the most trendy clothes of the season.
Combine beautiful silk shade finely with the female upper part or stretch with the needle pair.
With a silk hammer you can also cut more boldly and throw your legs, for example lenses or trendy autumn cowboy boots.
Whether it's grey, brown or multi-colored, all of the squads are now belonging to every woman's black hat clothing.
Combine a variety of colors with each other and play with the squares also with the special sets on the top.
For example, the combination of your squad and balloon is beautiful.
Insymmetrical helmets are a windstorm of summer, which can be carried with you in autumn.
The impersymmetrical helmet is both female and toy and fits perfectly for both arc and party.

Foreign Ministry and Greek travel agencies have warned the Finnish Zorba storm in Greece.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens also issued a storm warning.

Kimi Riikkönen explains why Mercedex is better than Ferrari
Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor of Mercedes was too hard at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not a big thing.
Our car was sometimes the best for the whole weekend until now, but they were just too fast, for the fourth time, and with his friend Sebastian Vettel, Räikkönen clearly left the Mercedes speed.
Ferrari had difficulty in the previous match in Singapore.
The speaker was asked what the sudden fall of Mercedece is due to.
They seem to go faster than we do. It's so simple.
If I knew the reason for that, we'd probably go the same speed as they did.
I don’t know more than anyone else.
This is always an estimate, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
At times, there was a rare delicacy for the future tale of Riikköse, Sauber.
Charles Leclerc, replaced by Ferrari in the next season, was seventh, and the last time session was over Marcus Ericsson.
The tenth departure for the Swedish band is best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving session five drivers were missing completely, the end result was still tasty for Sauber.
And maybe an encouraging speech in the future?
Yes, if compared to where they were from the beginning, then a step forward has been a big step.
Next year there’s a different story, so let’s see, let’s see.
Robert Helenius, Erkan Teperin: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper’s match in Stuttgart at night, I’ll be on a stable stage.
The German was a more initiative party in the framework, but he didn’t get a good deal for it.
Clearly, more extensive Helenius controlled the game in his hard series, which were well-known.
The Finnish was also in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth section, when Helenius knocked on the left straight to Teper.
The fate was so hard that the conquer that was taken in front of the house was not even trying to rise up from the floor.
After the winning, Helen was quite moderately windy.
In the body interview, he initially invited the audience to create a good atmosphere and opponent.
Then he switched for a moment to Finnish.
Thanks to all the viewers and supporters.
We've been taken with the sweat today.
Helen was pleased immediately after the match.
This was a great victory for Helena’s career.
There might be an opportunity to get to even the World Cup, Helenius commented on the evening before the match.
Instead, the loss could have decided the whole turkey.
Of course it has happened in mind.
There will no longer be any younger, Helenius, a 34-year-old, admitted before Teper met.
The number of victims of Indonesian disaster can be multiplied
According to The Guardian, the country’s Vice-President calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could rise to thousands.
Heavy conditions
The rescuers are looking for the remains of the injured, as well as the persecutors from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please from the port city and its neighbouring village from Donggal.
To date, all of the victims are from Pal, Donggal's situation is not clear yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been injured.
There are still people in different buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the hotel called Roa Roa in Paluca has been injured.
The rescuers are telling them to hear the screams of people who have been injured, but the lack of anger has delayed the start of rescue.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and raid.
The army and its vessels are needed because in the disaster zone electricity and communications are far away from many places.
Fuel reserves are also in danger.

Status symbols do not attract friends - Four Facts of Popularity
What makes man more popular, charismatic or admirable?
The researchers at the University of Sydney have figured two kinds of "cool" consisting of slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and, in part, opposite cool.
Surprisingly cool people, according to the description of the researchers, had many socially desirable characteristics: they were outwardly oriented, friendly, compatible and qualified.
Sometimes there was a typical distance, independence, rebellion and turmoil.
They shared their experiences and restrained only a little from external assessments.
Both types combined a good self-esteem and a stable sensual life.
The role of steel on no longer is cool: high status in teenage age may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the U.S. study published in the Child Development magazine in 2014.
Young people who were early on, picked up, searched for good-looking beans and sought for other people’s popularity, had increased the risk of being used as adults and acting as crimes.
In human relationships, they managed less than their invisible agemates.
High status messaged by luck buses, marker bags or watches do not make a person cool - or at least a really attractive follower.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more willing to be friends with their ordinary marketplaces than with those dressed in sign-ups – despite the fact that most of them chosen a sign-up at the meeting situation.
If you are on the Greek holiday island, be careful!
There's a shocking storm - weather warning screaming for red
During the weekend, Southern Greece can rain as much water as in Finland on average over a half-month.
Zorbas-hirmud storm strikes Greece during the weekend.
If you are in the area of Peloponnesos, the Ionian Islands, the Kycladian Islands or Crete.
The storm is extremely powerful, so the Finnish Athens embassy reports it on its Facebook page.
According to the large station, the Greek airline service has provided a red weather warning to the regions.
The nearby storm is also known as the weather service on the Forecan blog.
According to him, the hardest trees in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
Due to the comparison, the Kuisma storm broke out from the beginning of the week of Finland with its hardest bow at 31 meters per second.
However, the biggest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the rainfall.
For the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can be found in Southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has shared a video about the development of the storm on your Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize men dying Love Island in Ankun?
Showing up on confusing Youtube videos
A few know that the beautiful Anku, dying by several men in the series Love Island, also appears on strange YouTube videos published in 2010.
In videos, Anku advises stakeholders, among other things, to make an old black paper paper.
The anchor also shows its sympathetic style how cuffs can be made with a scratch of a silk, to which the right pigs are grown.
Now we are putting the Easter grass to grow, but let’s do it a little surprisingly, Anku suggests and presents the sharks, soaps, and seeds of grain, from which he makes the shelf.

Valtter Bottas fills the adrenaline and purses in Sotshi - does he become Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtter Bottas filled a little more than a dozen minutes after the Russian gp's fleet while he was in front of the media.
The great round left behind the one-star of Mercede Lewis Hamilton and was mentally important critic for the Finnish actress collecting this season.
Nice tours.
I don't know what happened to Lew when he left the solution circle.
It feels good, a little bit more, Bottas found out.
I have only been on board once this year in Austria (in the middle), so time has passed through the law.
This rail has been good for me in the past, and I got good rounds again.
It is not easy to pass on the Sotshin track, so the departure is particularly big in a role.
And, indeed, Bottas was able to respond to the appeal, whether he would win tomorrow or whether he would be in front of the MM title to get a Hamilton jean.
In my starting point, it's definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the ball, there can be no other goal, Bottas collapsed.
But we're fighting for both championships.
Lewi's leadership to Sebastian Vetteli is quite big and the difference is very big to me, so it must be remembered.
Let’s see what’s going on, but Bottas is complete.
Hamilton was really happy with the success of Bottax after the ride, and the taste of Mercede's taste Toto Wolff was also tasted.
Lewis had the intention to win Valtter, but he didn't succeed at the stop.
Valttery knows that he has to defeat everything by himself to win Lewis.
And he was so uploaded that the adrenaline pulled out of the ears, Wolff threw off.
The question is whether Bottax and Hamilton will be driven in a remarkable way, Wolff replied.
We're going to talk tomorrow morning, and we'll see how the case goes.
Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish championship in the rally
The railroad SM series rarely ended.
Never before, the brothers ended at the same time as Finland’s champions.
This was done by Erik and Henrik Pietarinen in the vicinity of Turin and Salon, because Erik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Erno Kinnunen ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place in the decision-making was held by him in the SM4 class of Finnish championship of the two-way cars.
The Honda Civic Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä started the tournament in Turin with a mall because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would guarantee the title of SM.
In the dark of Friday, the two had to be balanced when some of the additional lights were deceived by another special experiment.
It's time to get a third shot.
In such a situation, it is not suitable for the defeated.
On Saturday, only a second series of Jussi Tepo’s speed was followed, Kinnunen told him.
Syria demands the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls for U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
On Saturday at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops are fighting against terrorism in Syria, and the war against terrorists is, according to him, "the near end."
In the United Nations, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their home country.
For the seven-year war, however, there is no end.
In the war, more than 360 000 people have died.
Allied Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that it was planned to meet Syria in October, in which the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey would participate.
Not really Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of anxiety, received an exceptional amount of people.
The nomination drama of the Supreme Court in the United States has received at least 20 million people at the end of their television on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford who accused him of anxiety, were talking about his story before the Senate Justice Committee.
According to the initial results, the hearings were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, a total of 20.4 million viewers.
In addition to their online consultations, there were several million more followers.
NBC said the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people, and CNN reported its annual recording of 8.2 million live streams.
CNN’s number is rising to more than 10 million when it is calculated that trackers transmitted via YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital has also launched 8.0 million.
Digital launches are channels’ own, television shows are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish final readings on Monday, but they are in any way deceased.
Rarely over 20 million
More than 20 million audiences in the United States usually only reach sports rankings, the great Oscars and Grammy games of the entertainment world, as well as random political events such as president speeches, and in 2016 presidential elections.
In the U.S.'s annual most watched program, the NFL Football League's final match is definitely going to Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered around 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, Trump’s first speech to Congress, according to Nielsen, a total of about 48 million people and official fairly 30 million people looked at.
An important thing
The Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States because the offices are lifelong.
Trump has already managed to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died from the beginning of 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent such President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
The second place was open when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he had a so-called vacuum language in several issues, whose voice could resolve the position of the ninth court.
He was the supporter of the rights of abortion and sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, decided that the same gender gained marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in the canoe.
His choice to the highest court may close the Conservative Overpower for decades.
Children have the right to know their parents.
Only parents under the age of 10 see health data from their children from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Initially, the situation of Kanta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even see small health data or recipes.
In autumn 2016, a temporary adjustment to the situation was made for younger than 10 years of age.
After that, the practices have been promised to be fixed, but it has been amazingly long to be fixed.
Now the repair is permitted - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change of the legal basis should not have been more than translated.
After that, the comprehension of the paint is about the pressure of the button: when the pillow is now held, it opens.
Of course, the child can show his knowledge to his parents - if he has banknotes or an official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
The card is payable, and a 10-year-old does not even receive a bank ID.
In practice, the underschool’s four-class data cannot be viewed except by requesting them as printed.
It’s not just a parent’s right as a child’s right.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents may be involved.
The rights of teenagers to privacy must, of course, be taken care of.
You may also have family situations in which all things cannot be spoken freely.
They often relate to sexual health, which is of deep importance to the human rights of free care.
In the United States, the FBI started killing Kavanaugh’s disturbance charges
According to U.S. media, the FBI is examining at least two women's disturbance charges.
One of the women had been listening to the Senate's Justice Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has contested alleged sexual disturbance in her study time.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges on the request of the Senate's Justice Committee.
The report should not take a week longer.
According to the Washington Post, it is a criminal investigation into a more restrictive investigation, and it will not necessarily become public.
A man threatened to kill police at the police station in Kajan
The fastened rabbit continued to bulk in the chamber.
Police say they put a man in the police prison "in peace."
Police were suspected of being threatened by the mischief on Saturday night in Kajan.
The official informed about the case that began when a fair 30-speaking man hardly challenged disputes at the central restaurant.
The man first attacked the second client within the nutritional movement.
This was followed by the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by kicking him down.
When a third party was struggling, the man still shot him.
The triangle attack led to calling the police.
Police arrested the man and brought him to Kajan's police station, the police told him.
The suspect continues to behave aggressively at the police station.
The man would break the other police.
He threatened to kill the police.
Police say they have passed the man's police prison "to be calm".
The man is suspected of three crimes and a violent opposition to an official.
Assistance organizations are preparing to start work on Indonesian Sulawesi - "The clean water is the most urgent"
United Nations Children’s Organization UNICEF and other international assistance organizations are ready to help on the island of Indonesia’s Sulawes, said Finland’s UNICEF Information Chief Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescue, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to the normal operation, UNICEF has always a complete emergency, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people in ruined, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Sulawesi, rescue operations are in ongoing, but the situation in the region of Donggala is a bit more unclear.
There are still places with which connections do not work.
Assistance actions are difficult, because the roads are also gone, Haru notes.
Buildings are often lightweight structured in Sulawesi, so the damage caused by earthquake and tsunami are great.
When the survivors have been found, they need protection, first of all, for example tents, and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First of all, people are most often able to offer water cleaning tablets that Unicef also has in stock.
Water systems are designed to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported in advance, for example, by rails.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
Searching for family members and joining families is part of the mission of UNICEF.
The World Food Programme (WFP) is organized, among other things, as part of the United Nations.
In the early stages, emergency aid is used for funds collected previously.
However, UNICEF has already launched funding to help the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami victims.
Billionaire Elon Musk stops as president of the Tesla government - $20 million fines on twitters
The founder of space chains and electric cars, Elon Musk, avoids fraud in an agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is ending his role as president of the government of Tesla and agrees on fines of $20 million.
Musk is dismissed as part of the agreement he concluded with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing, Musk avoids fraud conditions.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Muskia for securities due to its twitters issued in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing the electric car company to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which made the company’s share rate rapidly rise.
According to the agreement, Musk should not act as the president of the Tesla government for three years.
In addition, Teslan must appoint a new "independent member" in its government and take two "independent leaders" in its management group.
Teslan must also establish a committee to monitor Musk's communication.
Musk can continue as Tesla's Chief Executive Officer.
In addition to Musk’s personal fines of $20 million, Tesla will also have to pay 20 million fines to the financial supervisor.
Twice leads to deception of investors
According to SEC, Musk’s twitter led investors and Tesla’s shareholders to be misleading.
Musk argued that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private shareholder company.
According to billionaire twitters, the company would have been purchased out of the stock exchange at a price of $420.
Tesla’s share rate increased by more than ten percent a day after twitters, but declined later.
According to SEC, Musk's claims had no basis.
In fact, he did not negotiate his claim of funding.
He also did not discuss the withdrawal of the stock exchange with any other management group or the government of the company.
On Friday this week, the rate fell by 14%, when SEC’s securities supervisors reported fraud.
The news agreement is expected to reinforce the course of the company.
The last sentence is no reason
The church’s watches don’t sound when the wizards don’t move.
It's a technical mistake.
The tower of the Helsinki courtyard has stopped.
Wizards show the clock at 12:00.
The situation is like a central horror film: even if the church’s krypt would be called to mind and the ruins would call themselves.
Of course, this is not, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken.
It's been a repairer watching it, but some part has been broken and is expected to have a new part, says suicide Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account has already mentioned.
In fact, the account mentions that the last sentence has no reason to stop the clock.
Jamsen tells us that the church watches aren't called for mistakes.
