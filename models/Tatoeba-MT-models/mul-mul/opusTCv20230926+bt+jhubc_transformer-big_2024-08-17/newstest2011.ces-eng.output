What are you doing? Czechoslovakia in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or a sugar
The new capital of the Czech Republic will have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand its older colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representation.
Journal Aktualmente.cz members of the new council of the Czechoslovakia "tested", as they know the notoriously introduced slang, which emerged at the council in the last years when Prague was ruled by current coalition partners.
The encoded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political dictionary during the previous era of Prime Minister Paul Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and chaos in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new council does not understand the concepts known.
At least they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm rather a newborn in Prague politics," he responded to the test of the "kmotrovsk" dictionary of the Council for Culture Lukáš Kaucký.
Although it is a political veteran, Karel Březin responded in the same way.
Maybe the term "golf jacket."
“It’s the only expression you present to me that I sometimes use.”
"I don't recognize your snake in general."
From the dictionary, which the words of the journal Aktualmente.cz published this year before the election congress of the ODS, it selected six editions of examples, mainly those that are notably associated with the Prague magistrate.
Socialists should explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the largest golf jack in Prague", "go to a sugar hall", "bearers' neck", "training the capital" and "opleching".
Three of the council members agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is going to lead Prague education in the future - promised a conversation first, but later did not receive a phone.
Peter Dolínek refused the test right away.
“I don’t solve these things at all, and what civil Democrats have to do, I won’t appreciate.”
"I'm now deciding how we will understand within our programs," he replied.
As it has already been said, the councillor Lukaš Kaucký would not be aware in the title above that he is talking about the influential entrepreneur and friend of the expressor Bém Romanu Janouškovi.
"Voldemort" does not say anything to the Caucasus, and the only term that correctly estimated in the test is the "largest golfer in Prague".
"That's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucký says, and immediately adds, "But I know it more from the newspaper."
"I'll have to pay some language courses," he jokes.
The golf jack as the Belnka tunnel is then decrypted by the administration not only the matador Karel Březin, but also the environmental council of Lukáš Plachý.
Both social democrats then know who is really Voldemort, and Lukaši Plachém is also known where to find this character - the meaning of the expression "go to the sugar".
"This means going to some Prague business," Plachý is closely dissolved that it is the headquarters of Janoušk Company.
Together with Brzezina, she reminds that knowledge was more tired of newspapers than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequencies of the test, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
“I’ve been talking to my colleagues, but it seems that we don’t really have anything like that.”
"We say names rather, sometimes names are used shortcuts and decompositions," said President of the Czech Republic of Prague, Petr Hulínsky, whose supporters renamed Hulda.
"I was called Bréza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues are called that," he admitted to his own surname Karel Brézin.
Currently, the name is tested and works.
Council Weinert is a grandfather or less friendly grandfather, Miroslav Poche, who warned himself about fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the name "Game".
The names are also the only thing the Social Democrats are allowed in the internal speech.
Hulinski said Huldu would not like to hear, but Aktualmente.cz also recorded another overname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Pocket Law" reminds that Petr Hulínski won his JUDr. title at the Bratislavan Police Academy.
The government wants to restrict the torture of witches, issued a brochure
Women declared a witch in Burkina Faso have several common characters.
Instead, they belong to the older generation, they cannot engage in work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to an isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man, this fate is very rare."
"Even young healthy women don't respond because they help work and give birth to children," she describes a regular sister who cares for more than a hundred women in a special house in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, whose community has been exiled from their ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against an unusual "social action".
She issued an information brochure that would help her to limit her to the witch.
But it's a bitch.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," said Die Standard.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, with Burkino Faso neighbouring, a 27-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, polluted and burned with oil.
The BBC server informed of the case.
It is an unfortunate agreement with circumstances.
According to their version, the oil is used for ritual anointing.
He shook after the group wanted to "have the evil spirit out of the woman."
The isolation of "wholesomes" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a twenty-year-old entrepreneur from Burkiny Faso: "The use of human souls was always a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to calm down the wizard, the president himself participated in Gambia last year.
"Gambia's President Jamie, after his aunt's death, has scattered a huge wizard who is allegedly supposed to participate in her death and try to kill the president himself with the help of black magic."
"He invited shamans from nearby Guinea to assist who, accompanied by police, soldiers and personal protection of the president, forced randomly elected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, people were forced to drink herbs with halucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After the international pressure, nearly 1,000 prisoners were finally released to freedom.
Bakal's renter: Topi in stones signed, higher rental
The elderly underground man went out of the door of the RPG customer center apartment "uhlobarona" Zhenka Bakaly, the largest private rental owner in Czech Republic.
Under the shelter, he had a new lease covenant with three apartments: his daughter, his daughter, and his son, who was in charge of the punishment.
All three deregulations have just raised the rent.
Instead of 3500 per month, the son will pay for 2+1 second category of 4100 crowns from next year.
"And there is no hot water there, and the petramus must be drilled (stone on heavy fuel, known to be red.)," the man shows a finger in the new contract of his son, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, whose new rental conditions are "incorrigible and irrelevant," advises hiredmen not to sign a new contract and wait until December 7, when they publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But a man over it just holds his hands.
"One says that, the other is that," he cries.
Ostravsko becomes a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments are still rented in the Czech Republic.
Currently, we decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG is one of a total of four at Ostravska and is already full on Tuesday morning at nine.
Right next to the door is the security agency’s protection and the deviation device.
"Yesterday 2011" will light a special button on its touch screen.
One screw and the machine gets out of the paper with the number.
You don’t need to read “157” and your number is already piped on a large screen under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're on line in half a second.
After a while, the older married couple comes to rent, wearing in the waiting room, but it is obviously not about new rentals at all.
Most people have come to address common problems like others - repair requests, insurance events and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are received in Ostravska to the postal cabinets by the lenders of the majority with a total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio from around mid-November.
RPG Apartments suggests to them in letters an increase in lease by 15 to 38%.
A special hire shuttle was opened on November 18 at the customer center.
"It's running over a week, so it's only in the run," the lawyers reply for a moment after the crash when the client appears as a journalist.
Deregulations and Bakal's former mountain apartments are local irritating themes.
Before the elections, he was quite halos hit by the Vice-President of parliament and the Ostrovian parent Lubomír Zaorálek from the Czech Republic, and now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after them I want a new floor."
"No one has changed the table in the bathroom," the man said in the introduction.
So far, according to workplaces, retirees are coming to make sure they get a discount from the rent if they sign in time as RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half-discount for February rental will also be obtained by other lenders who sign a new contract by December 15th.
Havirov's "deregulating" overhead, but the questions are definitely not counted.
"Of the last 360 customers here for 2011, there were only about forty to fifty people," the workforce estimates.
The RPG proposes individual agreements on the website and its walls where it is necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the rental, it will be required to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threats, but about information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," RPG notes on its website.
"No one will be judged here," one of the RPG apartment workers thinks, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her partly the truth.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 for food, I don’t want to judge,” he said.
The work is only going to disappear.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media that they don't sign, so people are probably waiting," he said.
The lease regulation ends in most Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG, their increase is economically necessary.
“The current rentals still do not reach even the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Apartment’s residence portfolio, recalled that, according to the owners of the house, the unforgettable housing fund is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could have invested in apartments of four billions, it would be 5.2 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large-scale screen on the ceiling opposite the polarized seats of the hoverboard stand stands up to date repeats several redly emphasized information.
"The increase in the rental in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, it is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the maximum of 7.50 Kč per square meter and month," she appears on the screen.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio will increase by 38%.
"In these cases, this is an increase from extremely low amount of £19.66 per square meter," RPG notes.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that the deregulation will not be expected to rent jumping, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
Additionally, he adds another commitment: all the money from hiring (see graph) will give the company back to the apartments, mainly to the heat savings - new windows and heating.
It is important to get people who sign a lease increase agreement.
Offices include school, architects understand.
The administrative building of Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide a minischool with everything that belongs to it - with colored walls, furniture, toys buying, and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the Arch.Design staff can visit it.
Arch.Design, a project-architecture company, from which the studios have taken up a number of important Brno buildings, has counted the space for its company minischool since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people mainly at the age of a babyboom and cares for women and architects to be able to quickly return to work.
Together with the possibility of shortened time, the school is the benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Constructors and architects have the opportunity to take care of the child in demand.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design staff and, with the support of leadership, they managed to obtain grants from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is funded from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment and the Czech Republic’s State Budget.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of €2,8 million) they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and ensure qualified staff and operation for two years.
After extraction of the financial grant (2 years) Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini school for three years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and with the request for grant was significantly helped by Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, child cares daily by nurse and teacher, so children can go to school without age limits, although most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it’s a mini school, only five children can be present at the same time, but more can be changed during the day.
The conduct of schools is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to exercise schools regardless of the hierarchy of the position in the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the program fill in a mini-school is comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation to schools, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, motivating games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and leave stressful situations by delaying children from schools away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents use their work time more productively.
It is not surprising that there is a naturally loyal relationship between an employer and an employer.
Arch.Design has become a member of Czech companies that offer significant benefits in gathering new employees, family-friendly and through this program has enhanced personal marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like the cemetery of an ancient cave, the staircase resembles the back of the dinosaur and the balconies are open with fish mouth.
This house is Casa Batlló in Barcelona from Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the local house, he used his organic forms to serve the name of the House of bones.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stone, cattle breaks and mosaics, a fascist resembling fox and all overwhelming soft curves, all of which are typical for Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The house's crossroads play dream lines, soft colors and textures that resemble nature and animals.
With detailed observation, you can see geometricity, rhythm and precisely reflected order.
In the night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, so it is illuminated to make the impression of the brightness of the colors even stronger.
The grinding and grinding of the shapes appear at the same level as in the interiors.
Wood in waves copies window frames, frames, decorative door elements, corners and sheets.
The Batlló House, located in Eixample, on the rude shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43, was built by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese in 1877.
The renovation took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, originally endured the collapse of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and cheaper construction.
Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí did not design himself.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Just on his designer bracelet there were decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of the mosaic on the facade.
There were also a number of other artists and artists working on the fascist.
The joint work on the proposals of Casa Batlló launched a successful collaboration of Jujola with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí’s house Casa Milá and Güell Park, where there are other Gaudí’s works.
From the locals, he served his home after completion, thanks to his organic forms, the renamed "Home of bones".
Others, due to the specific window opening mechanism, began to call it a "sealing house".
It is also said that the sword of St. Jiri, patron of Catalonia, is displayed at the top of the building.
The hidden religious motives also include other sacramental elements of the building.
Gaudí proposed a unique central heating system for his time with ventilation flows and typical cabins.
It may seem bizarre in their forty-five-degree tendency.
In the creation of Gaudí, he was absolutely not respecting the former construction regulations and did not allow him to bind them.
At the beginning of the construction, however, he received construction permits from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so important that two years later in completion, the City Council was threatened as a result and requested a correction.
The Council, for example, was the fact that the building also involved the pillars in the public pedestrian.
The correction never happened, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the challenge of the city, Josep Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two highest fathers of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower fathers.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor of the bedroom and the private part of the apartment.
The soil was sold for clergy.
The whole six-storey house covers the stairs, which can ride up to the rooftop terrace itself.
The basic elements of the construction were the cancellation of all the right corners and direct lines and the replacement of them by the walls covered.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting space.
The social part can be fully connected by opening salon doors and a larger society can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also acquired non-traditional coverage and two floors.
Gaudí’s game is also personal with light, blue and white glazed plates, which are covered by the inner courtyard, and lights.
The game two colors delivers maximum light in all aspects of the house.
It’s just enough to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which radiates the sun on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló House, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the spaciousest and most profitable apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step until 2002, with the opportunity to celebrate the hundred and fifty anniversary of the birth of the famous Creator.
They stayed at the exams because they found that it was a very affordable business and, in addition, the exams expanded through common and undercover spaces, including roof terraces.
The entrance to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is EUR 16.50 and students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of entry into other Gaudí buildings in the city.
To taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly shame with some of the Cincinnati residents and visit it directly at home.
How to Choose Matrace and Gross: Women Have Different Requirements than Men
Never a honourable bed frame, but the quality of the lighting area, i.e. mattresses and rising, give the foundation of really good beds.
It must, however, be harmoniously supplemented in order to correspond to a specific user.
When choosing, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which mattresses and roasts are inserted.
Typical example?
Maybe for weekend chalups, where they are not regularly burned, are not suitable latex matras, because they slowly "heat".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to rotate them regularly.
If they don’t have much ventilation channels in the nucleus and still lie on solid disks, they keep moisture: even the mushroom could appear under them.
It also takes a habit when choosing.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where many high mattresses are often used with softening layer, it will be difficult to feel well on low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they wouldn't sleep here."
"On their diluted shoulders, patches and sides needed mattresses to soften with a layer of lines."
“That is also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misunderstood “information” from joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamcik, who specializes in furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, he had a matrix with a pepper line years ago.
"Today it's okay, the appropriate matrix needs Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to evaluate the line of the foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimizes your rigidity and shape according to absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing makes you silent, you won't turn around at night like after a hard match.
Just sleep better.
Leather foam also serves as a protection against proliferations.
When choosing the size of the matrix, add another length of the walker to your height, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of about 180 cm so they need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, thus 180 cm together.
For separate beds, for example for singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and possible visit.
"Jinak is the rule for the width of the bed simple: when lying on the back you should have hands slightly advanced in the locker," advises Ing. Helena Prokop, characteristics of magicians and decorators, who focuses on the issues of healthy sleep and ergonomics of school furniture.
For a double bed, every one needs its own roast and mattresses, but here, when buying, be careful to sweeten the heights of mattresses.
Otherwise, there will be nothing else but mounting the rosters to different heights, but you don’t have to succeed in every bed frame.
The sheet mattresses should be at least 14 cm in height, the types with a sheet sheet of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the shape and cypriot layer.
"When you touch your hands or touch the matrix, you must definitely not feel the pruning," Helena Prokopova warns.
Each matrix requires a certain type of roast.
Full-speed bed, when mattresses and undergrounds are like stiff Siam twins, they have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
Matras are badly winding, they can't wash their coatings, which is now common.
And since we normally drop 0.2 to 0.2 liters of pot per night, it is clear that after five to seven years of matrix, it will begin to resemble one large (and crushed) network.
That’s why experts refuse advertising slogans about life of up to 25 years, or even life warranties.
But everything has its own.
And therefore, the practical advice from sellers: with a matrix width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the absorbable cover, but rather add a matrix protector that you can easily pick up and wash.
Although matrix coatings are typically produced today, they are swallowed around the circuit, so after breaking we get two parts (for washing and size of the washing machine very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and at one person) can resemble a lightweight combination in the ring with heavy.
Do you have a hard disk in your bed instead?
Never!
Maximum bed for visits for one night.
Nevertheless, use the sheet with ventilating holes (if no longer has them) and use a matrix with a pruricular shell and a height of at least 15 cm with the strains in the bags (including Taschenfederkern) and a cyprus layer.
Polyurethane mattresses on such a basis do not belong.
For non-containing lamel ropes with 14 to 18 lamels will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (a combination of latex and cocoa), but you will always pay more lamels, 28 or more, where the lamels in the area of the beder are doubled and the rigidity can be regulated.
The positioning lamel rods do not belong to the mattress with a prune rod, because they do not react to the positioning.
In addition to lamel thickness settings, the so-called shoulder belt can be added.
It is a special capture of lamel, which allows you to press, or even clot the lamel so that the shoulder sleeps well "forgotten".
For men who have "arms across the whole back" is definitely an important thing.
Even the matrix manufacturers already remember it, who in the "Pan" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulders area.
Women also remember - they again cover softer surfaces in the spots of bulbs.
For the most demanding customers, screw or deck roshs are designed with so-called multi-torn drilling.
Pressure is split into several points and reduces the voltage.
However, be careful once you use the right matrix and grow a bad pocket (big and "depressed"), most "plus" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the wrist should subdue the head and the tops to intervene only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the shoulder should equal the height of the shoulder (together with a shoulder sleeve or a soft zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original slams filled with trees.
Its manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least membranes.
The trend was also in the matrix.
Raw oils from which are made of polyurethane foam are replaced by natural oils, such as jumps and soybeans.
Soya is used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio in matrix means that the core is made of purely natural material," explains Petro Vasíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in matrix coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also cook the microcapsules to relax the fresh fragrance of the forest or levandule.
There is also division for men and women.
While men "cooled" the vegetable extract from the cord to absorb the mattress coating heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, coating "coating".
The extract from the red potatoes increases blood circulation, making it weaker with warmer sex.
Today's favorites?
Matraces made of cold foam (has larger pores with broken cell structure, it is so breathable than usual polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
The combination of various thicknesses of cold foams and "line" foams produce multi-zone matrixes, which know exactly where to be the head, the beads and the patches.
You will pay for a high quality matrix from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet health parameters, have a lower rate of VAT, are gates as health aid.
It was the first to achieve this advantage in the Czech Republic of Gumotex.
It’s not easy to scratch on a mattress and a roast.
Sometimes, for example, the shares of manufacturers or sellers that offer two matrixes at the price of one.
Perhaps the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with all memory foam memory in the pot for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can be available for free.
The age of the line or viscoelastic pins with an open cell structure and high density started the "spatial" temperate material of Tempur.
It originally emerged as a material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur in the heat softens, in the cold, on the contrary, is fixed.
The heat of the human body is perfectly adapted and its pressure is optimally distributed.
Hence, it is ideal for the emergence of proliferation, but also for increasing the comfort of sleep.
Viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, for example for special foams under legs, which relieve the legs and vein system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
Monitoring devices want more and more parents, so they want to cook their children
Fear of the child’s own brings more and more people to the idea of watching through GPS.
The system originally designed for car search can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is so far large as a sire box, but soon may only be large as a watch.
Many people frightened the missing Anicka case and began asking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the price of disruption of their privacy.
“We are trying to say that it is not a spy, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the Czech market trackers.
"I admit that in a certain case such devices may be abused, for example, when someone who doesn't know about it gets into the bag, but we haven't met with such a case yet."
"Mostly, customers actually buy it for security reasons," said Pilin.
According to him, the child should always know for what purpose the "cabinet" is used and how it is used in an emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova warns that if the child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he'll just get rid of it.
"And very small children demonstrate great creativity in how to lose some things, when they don't want to be under control."
"Great expectations have been raised earlier by parents of mobile phones, but they can be disabled as well as these tracking devices," Bočkova says.
It also argues whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a ready-made kidnapping, a criminal almost always ensures that the child has no electronics that can reveal his position."
"It's a phone now."
"When the tracking devices begin to expand, they will also look for them because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In this case, criminals will always be a step forward before the police," the psychologist says.
However, he admits that similar devices can help in the event of a continuous pedophile attack.
According to Robert Chech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and individuals, even when an immediate destruction of the tracking device occurs, its presence may help.
"The device can be set to regularly send the position after a certain period of time."
"If it has been damaged, at least the last position of the person will be available."
"The simpler devices have also built-in inclination meters, so even if a person just crashed and remained unleashable, the device will immediately send out warning with a positioning," the Czech Republic says.
According to him, a similar service can also bring smart phones with navigation, where you can only download special software.
The problem of current tracking units is that it is either a device that is similar to the size of a box from a sire or smaller mobile phones.
Their loss is always at risk.
According to Macro Weil’s Pilin, the device is now tested as a regular digital watch.
"This will be the biggest advantage in the fact that a potential aggressor doesn't have to know the tracking device at all."
"He knows it only after a while and it can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether tracking devices are developed into curtains or adhesives, they will still use the same technology as used for car guards.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (which use common autonavigation) and the mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has inflammatory snakes to move the Czech Republic, but it will last for only two years
The Czech army purchased 445 kilometers of snorkeling with the burning of turkeys.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of snow in stocks.
The army has stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of the snow is two, up to four years.
The army purchased firefighters from the STV Group, a. s. for $40 million.
The general staircase in the reason for the purchase of such a huge amount of MF DNES has rejected that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of burns per year during training.
However, from the prophecies of military pyrotechnicians, which the MF DNES said, it shows that all generals, officers of the command of the military, secretaries or cleaners would have to go through a very intensive pyrotechnical training each year.
Defence Minister Alexandra Vondru and the commander of the army Vlastimila Pick is unexpected.
This is only the reason for the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of fires.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the army's stocks would be enough for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, the basic training of each new professional is sufficient for at least two meters of firearms, as experts say, the army will ensure a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of women or special units - of stocks for those 225 years.
Military brigades have recently personally complained to Minister Vondro that they have almost no weapons in hand, so the shootings are also limited to money due to emergency.
The lack of the lower washing isn't talking.
“I don’t think it’s so hard for me to buy so many fires from us again and again.”
"But it's their decision and they surely know what they're going to do."
“For us, the army is a good customer we are trying to meet as traders,” says STV Group business manager Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, justifies hundreds of kilometres of the purchased snowboard even by the army will have stocks of this "municipality" for at least ten years.
Jan Dècký from the STV Group, however, is only talking about four-year lifetime of the fireplace and police or military pyrotechnician even about two years.
"For the perfect storage, it can be the four," one of them says, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish the name because of the Army’s criticism.
After the expiry of the lifetime, each ammunition must be carefully tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the life of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost additional money.
Another argument of the ministry is the multi-discount on 445 kilometers of firefighters.
“We were 60 percent less than the last year’s supply of two hundred and forty-four kilometers,” said Pejšek, spokesman of the Department of Defense.
Only for comparison: the annual consumption of firefighters of police pyrotechnicians who eliminate munitions from the Second World War or after the Soviet Army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police are always ordering only such amounts to consume this ammunition even before the expiry of their life.
It has been proven due to the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can also be more flexible to acquire more modern and therefore more reliable types of snowboards.
The Ministry of Defense has already had considerable difficulties with the elimination of tens of thousands of tons of munitions since the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-thirds of Czechoslovakia army prepared to cast on Rhin.
According to the Czech pyrotechnics, MF DNES said, in a couple of years the same problem is waiting: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fires that lacino is shopping today.
To date, I pump the contacts that I received thanks to the competition
The winning place in the competition Lifetime of the year helped Lukáši Pytloun to sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of the last year’s competition Lifetime of the year became an eighty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberce.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukas Pitloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that there was lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price in Liberia.
With savings from foreign brigades and with a bank loan, he bought a semi-destroyed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was a student of the third year of high school at that time was a great courage.
“The closer relationship between quality and price of accommodation with us did not give me to try not to do anything in that,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to rent foreign workers.
All the profits invested back to the house, which gradually converted to a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually been able to open four beds, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable was the last four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another, equally high quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Tisé Island, where we sold our franchising concept and other stakeholders on the franchise of the Pytloun hotel will be informed," says last year's livelihood number one.
"And in this sale of licenses to operate the hotel, there was a great deal of victory in the Lifetime of the Year competition," Pytloun said.
The victory has brought him greater recognition and popularity in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People met me in the streets, often additionally congratulated me, and I have to say that it was pleasant," she recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended for all who try something.
There is no need to win, every vision is good.
She says she has been pumping from contacts and familiarities that she may not have been able to go to.
"With some of those I met thanks to the competition, I started trading regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has had a slight impact on every employee.
He has about seventy years old.
"I observe greater loyalty and pride in participating in something that has gained general recognition."
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of the good work of all of us together.”
"My only name is stretched out in advance," says Luke Pytloun with modesty today.
I wish my followers a calmer year than we had at the farm.
The Euphoria of the victory quickly altered the impact of the crisis.
However, thanks to the goalkeeper's goalkeeper, Farmet has worse times behind it.
For the prize for the first place in the last year’s Vodafone competition, the company joined the Slovak House, the owner of the Farmet, Karel Hungarian.
The court then appreciated the efforts through which he built from a small toolwork in the Czech Skalaci firm with a millionaire turnover.
“I can say that the awards not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and increased our self-confidence for competition,” the winner said.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karl Zhgarsky to rent a small workshop as a compensation for the Communists’ funny property, he long refused, he refused his career in the company where he then worked, and with his father’s friends founded a company for plastic baths.
Soon afterwards, they began to specialize in vegetable oil lilies.
After eighteen years, it became the largest manufacturer of automated leathers in Central Europe.
The company has gained greater awareness even among the unfair public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand far better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate their cooperation with the company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Zhungary.
Last year, however, it was not only in the Farm as a sign of euphoria from victory.
The awards were based on the company’s economic results by 2008 and only partly from 2009.
The year 2009 was the hardest year for sale of machinery goods.
The crisis, which has not touched so much citizens, has already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict purchases of new machines and technologies.
“Of course, this situation didn’t even avoid us.”
"The markets fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production, and the release was also occurring," explains Karel Hungarian.
A life-threatening company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
However, they managed and maintained the company in profits, even less than before the crisis.
However, what they did not deserve in the Farm is investment in research and development.
“With grants, we built a research and training center, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, gained main awards at home exhibitions,” says Zhudarsky.
Everything shows that the crisis is behind them.
The markets are growing again and the number of new employees.
"I wish a new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a more calm atmosphere," says Karel Hungarian.
A survey that removes irrelevant regulations
The Absurdity Survey of the Year is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial appeal.
Some irrelevant regulations have already been cancelled.
The unfamiliar winner of the next year’s Absurdity survey became an obligation to carry documents that are also accessible to officials online.
More than one-third of the fewer than 4,000 votes.
For example, social security management requires a paper expenditure from the business register, even if an official can get it by two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, it will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require a withdrawal from the business register for insurance checks in payers," said Jan Buraňová, spokesman of the Czech Republic.
Enjoy all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Czech Republic must comply, and those unfairly cancel them with the meaning of the Absurdity competition of the year.
This year is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial knees held by the Economic News and is increasingly popular among the public.
If the votes were approximately 3,000 votes, there were less than 4,000 votes this year.
And it’s not surprising, the various legal obligations that serve only to keep our business, we still have enough and enough.
"Maybe in the number of taxation campers we are at the leading places in the world," Karel Havlíček from the Association of SMEs and the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business has been declared a goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic was positioned at 74th position in terms of business conditions, which was eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita competition of the year was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone may sign up for administrative and bureaucratic nonsense each year from April to the end of September when the competition is closed.
In order to login, the website www.firmaroku.cz will then select seven candidates to the “antice” and let the public vote on it during October via the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
Over a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations have been added to this year’s survey.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, as well as professional alliances and journalists.
For example, between the nominated “finalists” there was a requirement for the maintenance of roads and speed roads, or for entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven weeks of proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in the beginning of November at the Václavsky Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly involved in the personality of political and social life.
For example, this year, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association of SMEs and SMEs in the Czech Republic, or Peter Kužel, President of the Czech Republic’s Economic Chamber, attended this competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws entrepreneurs under foot, so my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessaryly complicate business,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The problem of disrupting the irrelevant regulations does not seem to be clear.
In 2007, the entrepreneur’s obligation was most likely to report three days in advance to the healthcare agency in the place where the permanent facility is located, the intention of travelling with a stand at the exhibition or a walk.
This obligation was removed by the new Law on Lifestyle.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was reported to the Office of the work for its foreign employee of the service travel within a period of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of everything good.
In absurd 2009, physiotherapeutics have a large mirror, refrigerator and two weights in order.
This was relief this year in the statement of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator waste.
New category appreciates socially responsible companies
Values are environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year’s fifth year’s competition for Economic Journals is the category named Responsible Company of 2010.
The goal of this competition is to support a reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the publisher and guaranteed competition as well as in the event of the year’s rival competition.
By this year’s first year of this special subcategory, Vodafone Company’s main competition in 2010 has joined companies for which business success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would publish a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from one to the other, their efforts can be considered to be support and reliability as joint appointers.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities, and elsewhere, personal problems or health of their employees.
Among fourteen public finalists, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main contributor of the fund sponsoring hendiked children for seventeen years.
The paperwork of Poděbrad, which has more than 70 percent of them, has been given the title of the Responsible Company of the Central Republic, and in the Vodafone Competition of the year, the company has been placed in the country as a third.
In Olomouc, the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which introduced a flexible working time, also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a relatively reduced salary.
The headquarters also awarded her the fact that she prefers buying from Czech producers, supporting civil activity in the neighbouring area and saving the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to ensure that our business and our administration have the least environmental impact," said Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústecké kraj again thinks of the health of its employees and has provided to each laptop ergonomic chairs and keyboards, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Human in tribulation Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roman community," says the company's representative Ondrzej Suchý.
Lastly, it is also worth mentioning the activities of the Lavande and cleaning company from Karlovarsky region, which contributes to their employees in the form of overstandard bonuses to their retirement bonds.
“We are making contributions to food, transport, enhanced qualification and recreation again,” says Josef Strapáč, a winner in the Moravskoslezka kraji, from the Bruntal construction company Czasch.
All finalists of the Vodafone Companies of the year were automatically logged in to the category Responsible company of the year, who responded to the questionnaire attached to the applicant and sent it to the organizer by 15 August.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then removed from the evaluation by the orderer.
“If the Competitive Company’s representatives did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competitive Company of the Year, but they were not disqualified from the “main” Vodafone Competition of the Year.”
"It is not possible to log in only to this competition because this is the company's main competition subcategory of the year," explains Karel Goldman from Bison & Rose's ranking agency.
Police arrested at the Plzni Land Fund in public competition
In the building of the Earth Fund in Plzni, the anti-corruption police arrested in recent days.
The railroad detectives planted local entrepreneurs in the media sphere and realities trader Luboši G.
It is alleged that it has attempted to manipulate the current public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition is acquired by a particular contractor.
He had to pay half a million dollars for that.
"I can only confirm that the police are seeking one person for the offense in public procurement and in public competition," said Plenn State Representative Chief Antonie Zelená, who said that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
A sixty-year-old entrepreneur was released after 24 hours.
The way it could affect the public competition can only be speculated, given the minimum of official information.
The spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomíra Blackná on a questionnaire of Law stated that police were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Plzni during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition has, according to the Black correct title, the "Invite to submit claims to land transfer under land law" and takes place in the event of the interest of more legitimate applicants in the proposed land.
"These persons under the call shall offer a higher value of their reimbursement claims to be arranged by the transfer than the declared value of the land."
"Depending on the proposed claims, the order of buyers is set, and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the spokesman explained.
Luboš G. apparently had the information that entered into the call, and because he himself is also an eligible person, as he had a number of refund claims, offered the land recipients that the competition was not participating.
Probably he's incapsulated for it.
That would explain that he had so much money in detention.
Luboš G. had over-standard contacts at PF in Plzni already in the past.
He figured in the case of former head of PF Václava Sankota, who was criminally charged for issuing in a replacement refund of the land on which the location of the building was already issued.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land for the construction of public communications, particularly in the place where a master’s admission to the industrial area of Borská Feld was to be built.
Later, he had a very advantageous exchange with a magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the mayor had to come to it, because otherwise it would threaten the blocking of the lands of the building.
Housewives pay hundreds of households per month
Households will have to pay not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and water, heat supplies and somewhere for rent.
Families will have to get out of the coins from January to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity will increase by 4.6 percent, gas will be approximately 2% more expensive, until you will have to pay a tenth for water supply in some cities and many will also irritate central heat supply.
The betrayment of electricity in homes should go out annually of the stokorun road than now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have lowered power prices, and there is a significant increase in support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics.
Gas is a slight increase, however, at the time when people are most hot and have the highest consumption.
They also have to count hundreds of crowns each year.
While electricity and gas are reflected throughout the republic, the change in central heating prices differ from place to place.
Price rise is mainly planned by larger towns.
For example, homes in Pardubicas or Hradci Kings will pay for central heating by about 50 krones per month, with more than 1000 krones per year by the family in Liberia.
Prague’s residents are again at risk that more than 9% will increase their water and water supply, in the event that the city will increase their rentals from the infrastructure.
If the rent doesn’t change, the Pradesh will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will remain in the general public comparison of the lower.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are now one of the highest, water and stove have 7.4 per cent.
For example, a significant rise in the rental price of 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends since January.
For example, the company CPI Apartments, which owns approximately 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new lease will intend to bring the company to court.
Regulated rentals, which are paid by people in about 300,000 apartments, could increase by up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children are drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is from fashion, acts slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whisky stolen for parents.
These are beverages, after which drinking ends most often in the care of doctors drunken who have not yet been fifteen years old.
The exception is that children who are treated in the hospital are repeatedly.
This is based on the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the income of children’s hospital departments.
“Some beer or wine are totally uncommon because it takes a long time to drink them.”
"Trendem is certainly hard alcohol," said the Law prime minister of the Children's Hospital Hořovice in Central Czechs Luděk Pelikán.
"When they can get a bottle of dad out of the cabinet, it's whiskey, but it's over the fernet and vodka."
"Woodka has the advantage of getting her into the juice and not feeling so much of them," the prime minister said.
And in truth, Motol Eva Jurin's faculty hospital spokesman.
"It's most commonly fernet or rum."
“This is modern alcohol, especially at primary schools.”
"In some cases it was a promise that they brought out of their house," Jurinová said.
According to the primary Pelican, 13 or 14-year-old drinkers are a relatively common phenomenon on hospital income.
Before the Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has worked for ten years at the pediatrician in Motola, where the sanitizens are pushing out the pupils from a wide area.
"A girl with us lied about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve when she was brought to us with 3.5 promile alcohol in the blood in addition to extase," the doctor described a serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Holešović for a dance party."
“It’s interesting that her mother didn’t even get strange that she didn’t know about her daughter for 48 hours,” the prime minister said.
The unlikelyness of parents or even their significant tolerance to drinking their own descendants is considered the main cause of growing childhood drinking.
However, it is not possible to talk about dependence in the true sense, according to experts in children.
"The term alcoholic means a several-year chronic alcohol dependence with all the phenomena that belong to it, and it is not in children."
"For those who are drinking alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a characteristic non-family-social background," Pelikán said.
According to the Jurin spokeswoman this year, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motole until mid-November.
However, only those with severe poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children's drunkards, who have been taken by their parents after the ambulance treatment, or who have been taken by the police, are not counted at all.
Except when children just sit after school and drink a bottle of coral, there are three seasonal variations on which they can rely: witchcraft, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"They either regret bad testimony or celebrate the beginning of the holidays."
"But at the witch, I experienced the receipt of seven children's drunkards at once," said Felix.
A drunk, who spends the night of detoxification under the supervision of doctors, is paradoxally in the advantage of the one who will suffer unpleasant cocktail the next day at home.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and deficiency of glucose starts infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better on that, because they have a nice evening experience and a good awakening and nothing is wrong with them."
"They're only confused from where they are," Pelican admitted, sometimes destroying the pleasant mood for patients by calculating the costs they were required to treat them.
The transportation of sanitation and hospitalization to the acute bed will also cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"Occasionally I used it as an educational means when I calculated directly to those children on the visit, how much their drunkenness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make a single party," he added.
However, in the case of child drunkenness, health insurance companies do not apply to regressive procedures in which parents would charge treatment costs.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 of the total five pieces, for which the Czech Defence Ministry exchanged the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, fled to Spain on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that machines of this kind appeared in possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they were only in practices or years of practice.
This is a two-local version of L-159T1, which has yet to be operated by the Czech Army and which has been flying.
The remaining three machines are one-stop L-159.
These are currently reserved in Aeru Vodochody and the broker of the trade - Omnipol - already took over last week.
When the planes are physically departing from Waterfall, it is not yet known by Jan Pejška from the press defense industry.
"The single L-159 aircraft for exchange were separated from long-term aircraft, without additional deposits and investments from the Ministry resort."
"The two-local L-159T1 have been changed in the current state and shape," said Pejšek.
He added that the army would not remain without two-local aircraft as the ministry signed a 200 million crown contract with Air Vodochody in May 2009 for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 machines for two-local machines.
One new flight took over the army in July, the other will take over by the end of this year.
According to Peixka, the EADS has pledged that the aircraft will be armed by some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft carrier is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is the customer's thing in how this thing will be realized," Pejšek said.
Economic newspapers earlier said that the Spanish army of L-159 was uninterested, for example.
The replacement of the L-159 for one airplane Casa and the purchase of three other airplanes for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defense did not sign up for the purchase of the auction procedure and directly addressed the EADS.
The further defence leadership argued that the exchange would support future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and used only 24, the rest would like to sell.
The purchase of an aircraft Casa is likely to have a legal truth.
The European Commission has appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it has to choose aircraft on the basis of a whole European camp and not by a single manufacturer.
The Army has already taken three Casa flights, the last one should fly to Prague airport Kbely in fourteen days.
Longer indicator than a ring means lower risk of cancer
Men who have a sign longer than a ring are exposed to a lesser risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
It can be associated with the male hormone testosterone level.
“Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men up to 60 years,” said Ros Eeles, co-author of the study, professor of the University of Warwick Institute for Cancer Research.
This could help determine which men should test prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risks or other threatening factors such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in the UK followed over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time over 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants had a fingertip on their right hand shorter than a ring.
It paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were equally long.
In the case of those who had a fingerprint longer than the ring, however, this risk decreased by 33%, for men to the ages of sixty, it even decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers - formed in the prenatal period - obviously reflects the different levels of genital hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that testosterone is promoting growth in prostate cancer.
The leading Czech genetics and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences professor Václav Pačes for the Czech Republic said that he usually knows about this study, but he doesn’t seem to say that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer was “fully proven”.
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On roads and hiking is mostly snowy, roads ride in many places all night.
The D5 route is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 kilometers in the direction of Distractov due to several truck and passenger car accidents and also stands D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was told by the director of the Central Car Club (UAMK).
On the 91-kilometer there he crashed a truck, on the 93-kilometer he crashed two truck cars, the accident demanded a injury.
There were also a few passenger cars in the car.
Problems are also on the D1 road to 185 kilometers in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks hit there.
The drivers should sit just behind Brno at the 190th kilometers or go through Brno and then eat at 182 kilometers to Kyvalce.
There are several kilometers of colonies.
The D11 is also an accident on the road, as soon as it arrives in Prague.
In Prague there are several centimeters of snow, temperatures show minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, the car columns are formed on Proseku, and they are also swallowed by Sterboholska.
The most secure transportation means is the metro.
The tram is delayed, for example, on the route between the Karl Square and the Square of Peace.
At 8 a.m., the Prague Crisis Stage will meet again.
The problems are also faced by railroads and airports.
The Czech roads have already had to cancel seven speed connections because of the snow.
For example, it is difficult to get from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should control the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from Wednesday 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.
Most of the roads to the south of Morava are already swallowed, but only with increased caution.
There are three inexpensive sideways in Vyškovska, in Brno the ski languages are formed, and in Blanenska, some communications are needed in the ski chain positions above.
One of the most disabled places was Vyškovsko.
To date, there are closed routes: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
They will need to put the phrases on them.
When they are translated, they can’t be estimated yet.
There is a need for caution in the White Carpathians area.
On roads that are preserved there only by an inert defeat for the protection of nature, it lies up to five centimeters of snow.
In the Czech Republic, snow occurred between two and ten centimeters, most of which fell in the northern Czech Republic, often up to 18 centimeters.
Around 15 centimeters of snow occurred in the Moravskoslez region.
The snow in the Czech Republic gradually melts.
American soldiers have a new "fire gun"
The U.S. army installed a new "fire" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under code label XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic gun will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is something like a small superprecision.
Its projectiles have a laser with precision at a few meters.
25 mm rails, developed for this gun and containing high explosive bulbs, actually function as small granates.
The naboots can be programmed in such a way that they explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
Therefore, they can be used against an enemy who hides behind any obstacle, behind the wall, or in a burial.
For Shora is usually not protected, and when a murderous rainfall of steel strains comes upon him, it can expel him from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new weapon for pedestrians is using "smart" technology.
"The soldier in principle treats it by finding a target, sending to it a laser radius that determines the distance, so it gets a precise point of intention, according to it adjusts the direction and touches the corner."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the launch, the gun is charged and fired to a distance of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Move 400 jobs
The Fujitsu company moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their job in July of the following year from the current administrative building at the Marienbader square in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu group moves its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As a gigantic in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance, in July of the following year, 400 men and women moved their workplace from the current administrative building at Marienbader in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to the spokesman of Fujistu, there should be more than 100 jobs in the group, which are currently divided into the region, in the future.
The rental offer was very attractive and large-scale offices in Astro Park said they are more suited to the work mode of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only rented.
The competent agent Bernd Wagner said, "We have found a central headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection with the airport is very important for global companies such as Fujitsu.
Recent relocation of an important business within the region led to joy in winner and disappointment in defeated.
Markus Frank (CDU) said that he managed to gain a global player.
It's a "fantastic manifestation of trust in this place."
Fujitsu says it fits to the city, settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The oldest Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in time by the company’s manager of its intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the problems of computer manufacturers with the real estate renter on the Marienbader square.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it is to prevent long-term insecurity in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and renter of the building will be cooperative."
The house at Rathaus Square, which was used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were one of the most discussed buildings of the bath city ten years ago together with the other buildings at Marienbader Square.
Between the stations and the municipalities was a joint project of the city and a private designer of the so-called urban entry, which was also criticized for the massive construction of areas that previously served as a parking lot and also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a travel distribution software manufacturer, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu computer manufacturer, who was then linked to Siemens, moved to the home.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 together with Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and after a year were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group in Tokyo is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computer companies and servers available and also takes care of the required service.
The branch in the region of Rhine and Mohan is one of the largest in Germany, but the most of Fujitsu’s employees is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad, another subsidiary of Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the administrative building of Astro Park, 7000 square meters were rented for this purpose.
In the complex - its name emphasizes the star soil, a twenty-year-old, resides among others also the central alliance of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon turns off the server - threats against Assangem
Wikileaks gets into narrow.
Amazon’s Internet service has disabled the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened on political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic departures.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange remains in the UK.
Wikileaks, a detection platform, is available in the United States under increasing pressure.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
In the meantime, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called for other countries and businesses to fight WikiLeaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led to the list of searches by Interpol, is supposed to remain according to a newspaper post in the UK.
Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon.
"Free expression in the country of freedom," the activists reported publishing the service of short Twitter reports on Wednesday (local time).
Amazon recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to be able to manage a high number of access to documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks explained this step: "Okay - our dollars are lost now by hiring people in Europe."
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “but they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators have been searching, CNN released on the basis of information from Lieberman’s office.
The president of the Senate Committee for Home Defense threatened Amazon's boycott, the British Guardian said.
"I would like Amazon to join this step earlier, given the earlier releases of classified information on WikiLeaks," the Senator said.
Meanwhile, Lieberman called on to prevent the platform from using servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks acts illegally, unholy and unrespectably, and therefore our national security is exposed to danger and threatening life on the whole planet," he said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help Wikileaks expand the stolen material in their efforts.”
The founder of Wikileaks Assange, who is searched for by Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list of searched by Interpol.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian in the UK is also known as Scotland Yard.
An online activist has always identified the investigation in Sweden as the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London said there were also threats.
"Even the challenges of killing Julian Assange were."
Assange is rightly afraid of its security,” said Hrafnsson.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has asked the person responsible for the release of WikiLeaks to be charged and convicted of the traitor.
In Canada, Stephen Harper, head of government, said it was ironic that Assange should be “killing” and Obama could use a target plane.
In the meantime, she broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “missing and absurd” that Assange asked for a resignation from Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if it was responsible for recent spying challenges to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of one person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
A special entity was appointed by the Deputy Director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, according to the White House.
Travers has become responsible for the development of "necessary structure reforms", which are necessary after the release of reports from the e-mail to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to explore how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that he wants to take care of the security of disidents and activists if they are in danger of being released on WikiLeaks.
"We've done everything to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, spokeswoman of the Foreign Ministry.
"We're ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice Cream University
The "Gelato University" in Bologna prepares freezing sugars for a better year period.
The basic course for future freezers, which takes three days, is a great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does this ice cream actually get?
From Gelatier and Gelatier.
Gelatiere, a little older Czech ice cream, produces cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio pulls the ice cream out of the cooling box, pulls it into the fees and sells it.
To find out this, you don't have to travel to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
Anyone who wants to learn more about the ice cream will not escape the "Gelato-University" Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines established a ice cream university in order to match the ice cream from its machines all over the world with high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which takes three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
There are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream.
Someone in their Midlife-Crisis wants a new career, others are brave to the thin ice of their unclear desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all parts of the world - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a professor of art from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the Ice-Cream industry in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and she wants to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman at home Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Determining not only a good taste, but also a gentle weakness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the Southern and Native toothbrush on the cake: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it includes a notable dose of romanticism."
The first step in production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, sweater, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools up to four degrees immediately.
Then it turns on the machine with a cowboy and extracts the pasteurized white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of dairy ice cream.
Immediately the teacher is satisfied with questions: Is it possible to make freezing only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment himself?
Luciano warns him to leave the spirit of time unknown.
Whoever speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently also has used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar grains of guar.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise the customer will collapse and the ice grain itself.
Certain variations of basic matters are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano differs from the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are purchased in a supermarket either in a fruit department or in a sweetening department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to add a lot of aromatic ingredients to you."
"You should just experiment."
Both with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or frozen from white basic substance, which will turn the eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of all kinds of chocolate.
He is now able to participate in the course of ice cream machines.
Luciano is always allowed to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and liquor ice cream - either with eggs or without them in basic substances, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be performed with fruit species of ice cream.
More aromatics, more fruit pyre - due to the taste it is not always better.
Ice cream may not taste more grapefruit when it contains more grapefruit grapefruit.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is produced by a group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only after the balanced mixture will raise the proper taste of Gelato, Luciano says.
The production of ice cream is purely a number of tasks: If you use broccoli powder with lots of sugar, the sugar percentage in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice cream requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano removes an appliance that determines the sugar content of the fruit (which measures grapes from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the numbers.
Ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It does not only help the device to automate the production of basic substances.
There is also a device that mixes a finished ice cream mixture at the same time into the cream and cools to a minimum temperature.
Despite all automation, we do not avoid small accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo will climb himself and his colleagues from the bottom to the bottom of the fruit pearl when he gets out of control of a huge mixer.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time when something like that happens."
Auditors in Double Lights
The European Food Authority of Efsa is provided with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation is now spoken by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent biotechnology impact assessment institute.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Christoph Then, chief of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the group of Efsa specialists for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa specialist have been contracted for several years with the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated decisively in the Efs control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interests, he criticizes.
According to the EFSA, they are consistent in the entire paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and are therefore a handwriting of the industry, which should be controlled by the office of the Italian Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech highlights a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efs passed without additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngent - and thus changed the side.
The radio for Central Germany (MDR) has also recently revealed the personal connections of the EU Control Office with the industrial lobby, which has raised interest in both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Efsa cannot recognize conflicts of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. those of the industry, if they are highly professionally quality, is stated in a statement.
Experts who work for Efsa are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must prove it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt to feed, and that genetic plant reactions are not tested on environmental impacts.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn in the field will do,” says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which will not provide reliable results.
"If there is no risk, how would they be found?" he asked.
Angelika Hilbeck also agrees.
The researcher has been investigating genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical College of Curyx.
In this area, the industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists, just as in the United States, and now in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no more scientists who would not be connected to the group.
Studies that are mostly critical for society are not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck says.
Track of stones
Uli Gsell also took some, a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday evening, he stood at the Stuttgart station, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
The snow.
The story is known: in September the bags came and began to shake a large piece of the northern wings.
The world in Stuttgart has no longer been the same: Thousands have demonstrated against the S21, a billion station reduction.
When the building was stopped, the majority of the wings were laid in the trousers.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim, a soft crude stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a farmer in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
It is said, "Left and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut off, he smelled smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with those pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest at Tübingen at the former deponie of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades with old stones.
He bought all that was created during the blowing in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they had craved on a crash or disappeared on a depony," he said in his office, a wooden bud, who was a guard house before.
He tells him that he was handed over and threatened when in all the newspapers it cost him to buy the remains of the northern wing from the company that demolished.
He talked with the S-21 opponents all day long.
And he explained to them that he couldn’t demolify.
And when it happens, it is the smartest when the stones continue to be used.
Then they took about 200 S-21 counterparts each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it when rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and cut off what happened in the baggage and on the wardrobe.
The stones of the Stuttgart dispute have long turned into a "season" or as the edges of herbs.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If there wasn't that political flaw."
She sits in her car and walks through her 20th hectare kingdom.
He studied first law, interrupted study, later biology, then interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest trader of old stones in the republic.
It sounds.
In the snow there are artificially worked sandstones.
"They belonged to the Marien-most in Dresden," she says.
The Labe, yellow, warm, is excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going on the way up through the forest.
It shows on the crowd: red sand, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And then.
"Good travertine."
One time, the knights belonged to the Neckarstadion tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police president in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuf from the Heilbronn hospital.
What kind of work, what kind of effort, what kind of pot.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were broken by hand before and transported by means of simple crafts and bullets, he becomes totally reverent.
"It would be a scandal if something like that had happened."
He has not become rich, very rich at all.
The stone merchant today, however, employs 14 people, and in addition, stones were planted up in the forest, one craftsman, one craftsman, one glass and one gardener.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Colombia at the same time.
The stones will also be saved there.
The battle of talents for high potentials
There are a lot of people in dining.
16 students are pressed with loaves, tomato soups and sweets.
The Braunschweig Technical University and Volkswagen car manufacturers invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with VW’s developers, they’re going to talk about the future of the car – and, by the way, only know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed and wager in cooperation with universities in the fair with the smartest heads, as well as the VW company.
Their mission is to recruit the most desirable graduates in the hearing as soon as possible, even before they get into the labour market and others will take care of them.
Since universities do not provide any lists of their students’ success, the companies try to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automobile company is trying to get talents on the second day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes regulations, rubber bears and boards with the VW logo.
It tells young talents about training programs, students’ jobs and indicates their journey to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project along with VW.
They see the benefits of both sides: "Students get in touch with the industry and get experience."
"VW can at the same time meet students, get closer to interesting candidates and think about who would be a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
The news is that he is fighting so openly for students.
“Jinak was a rather important professional project,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long-standing candidates.
On the contrary, it is necessary to try and strive to strike specially highly qualified workforces.
In particular, graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiation position.
According to the German engineers’ Association, VDI remained 40,000 unemployed positions in October.
And according to VDI, the so-called deficiency of engineers is still growing.
KPMG’s auditory and advisory company is Roman Dykta for talent hunting.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, the type of a modern treasure factory where participants must find a path according to the GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promised students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can at the same time view KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
In advance, it will be decided in two selection wheels who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people flying to the United States.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, laws will be increasingly harder under the laws of the Dykty.
"We want to differ with our Race from others."
"One trip to the square was very little for us."
Dyk's talent hunter seems to be lucky.
“We’ve been in contact with all participants similar to the event last year.”
“Some will soon finish the study and plan to work with us,” he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are classical in the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"As for example at Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, the leader of Solarworld solar technology manufacturer's personnel department.
The company from Bonn employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
He knows the problem with young workers.
There are currently 35 posts on the company's website.
"Now it's hard to have free spaces."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld collaborates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist does not carry out any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to gain other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Great companies can’t offer it often,” says Stübe’s personal department leader.
For a long time, money hasn’t played a major role in searching for work.
Flexible working hours, child care or good procedures are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany in a study of Great Place to Work.
The Institute is an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are questioned how satisfied they are with their work and the work environment and monitor the employee’s framework conditions.
The Head of the Personal Department of Stübe hopes that the location will bring points to the stakeholders for work.
"I believe that the stakeholders are particularly informed about the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
According to Mr. Kriegler, this is primarily internal action.
“The best way to see as an attractive employer leads through his own employees,” he says.
This is called the Internal Employer Branding, that is, the marketing of employers on the market within their own employees.
"The satisfaction of employees is the best ambassadors."
When the company cares well about its people and they identify with the company, they will do their own advertising to their employers between friends and friends.
"It's like a sample game," Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Trees
Over the next few years, there will be no new oil drills on the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government issued the appropriate ban - and thus abolished the previous plans with the final effect.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new ropes are yet to be banned.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should be paid for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the rough tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which took eleven employees’ lives and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled that the opposition and industry would press on their willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The opponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for the devastating oil burning in the Gulf.
The central criticism is the British energy group BP, which is confronted by billion demands.
Obama’s commission of investigation should present the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar canceled the drilling ban which was paid from the explosion.
Thereafter, various oil companies filed applications for new roasting intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by stricter controls and strict security regulations.
Currently, the supervisory authority is fundamentally reformed, which has highlighted many allegations of corruption.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would cancel lucrative tax evasion possibilities for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulations will substantially reduce the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"Government plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the gas and oil industry," sounds the result of a current survey in the field of the BDO advisory firm - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance still complains about uncertainty in the field: “Nobody knows exactly what regulations will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are up to the revocation - to the pace of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
Water in the rivers is oil brown, smells like a pump: billions of liters of unique oil destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People live with stealing, corruption, and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks that well.
"Don't get rid of it," says a journalist, an ecological activist: "Today you'll get a lot of oil in front of the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian looked at a attempt to photograph a boy who is sealing on his chest with water surrounded by the mosquitoes: this scene acts in a water brightness with spirit colors almost beautifully.
The fact that under the blue-brown surface of the oil is not seen.
Earlier, she collected enough garnel in containers, tells Esther Badom on the edge of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow-blowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil came into a huge flavored area from the broken lead.
Fishers from the nearby town of Bodo must fall at least six hours to get into the waters where fish are: the Ogoni region, located in the heart of the delta of the Niger River, belongs to one of the worst contaminated areas in the world.
The way through the river with many mangroves pools with lateral attachments is only a significant whole range of the start.
The engine on the boat is cooking instead of bright water with brown cash, and whoever puts his hand into the water will pull out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves climbing from the ground as black leather straps, rarely allowing the palms to blow their leaves sadly.
We are constantly looking for a hill of birds that usually occur in wet areas: as soon as the engine is silenced on the boat, it will dissolve in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrifying silence.
"What's happening here is the ecological leadership of war," Celestine Akpobari sadly says, "we live in constant health concern."
Comparison with war is legitimate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European residents were registered here, here was the first defence with later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell group had to stop in 1993 for its production.
To date, the company cannot return to the Ogoni area: while it enjoys the entire delta area of three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining holes and 7000 kilometers of lead over two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area lies very instability for the group.
Each hundreds of meters are torn from the water of the steel structure as a strange soil: "Watch Trees", so the heads of the rough holes are very mildly called.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the morgue.
Every moment, such a head of a rotary hole is broken, tells Akpobari, and then flows the constant flow of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil that went into the sea at Alaska when the supertanker's "Exxon Valdez" crash 21 years ago is one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes that are responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While the Shell company marks sabotage and organized oil stealing for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental guards are talking about rushing heads of the groves and the unconditional leads as the main cause.
Shell requires much smaller security regulations in Nigeria than the world's habits, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: "Only the amount of leadership disorders is "sometimes higher than elsewhere."
In a place that looks far away as abandoned, with oil wrapped under the broad sky, it will be removed from the mangroves of the characters: they are completely naked and to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many courts, which are partially associated with the leadership, partially disrupted around the ground, fire burns: illegal small refinery.
The oil is warmed in the court over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
First, it runs out of the lead to the catching gasoline, then the cap at the end of the lead of the kerosine and eventually the oil.
This way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four courts a day for 300 liters: “We will earn 34,000 Naira” — about $22.
Delta residents use a chronic deficiency of pollutants in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of €40 cents per liter of oil may still exceed illegal producers: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from "bunkers" that drink to lead around the Ogoni region: according to experts, in the entire delta region of the Niger River, the country loses at least 16 million litres of oil a day.
But only a small portion of temporarily stored raw materials is illegally disrupted: most of the shares of organized criminal networks, including politicians and the high position of the army, are in tanks and sell them on the world market.
Debate whether residents have caused a disaster and their intervention or a lax method of production, Akpobari activist is considered purely academic.
"If oil companies weren't regarded as a vessel and wouldn't destroy the life of the fishermen so perfectly, there would be no sabotage, thieves and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell is so devastated that it only takes into account the departure of the group: "People like the Chinese may appear as better."
Michael's going to be quiet.
“It’s the highest time to disappear,” says the muscle manufacturer.
"Every time, soldiers can come."
If they were found by a special military unit, they wouldn't be imprisoned, but painful pay.
Also, soldiers who mostly come from the northern country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from raw materials.
"The damn thing then got our land in every way to the bottom," Akpobari says.
Investigators found a dangerous construction error in the A380 engines
The A380 has an apparent security failure.
The investigators found when browsing the machine that had an emergency landing was a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophe engine failure".
Qantas wants to accuse engine manufacturers.
Qantas’ passenger airbus had apparently more luck in the emergency landing at the beginning of November than it was known: the Australian Air Safety Office found a major safety failure on some A380 engines in its investigations - and now warns against possible construction errors.
The failure may have severe consequences: on a single oil connection, it could be caused by the deforestation, the ATSB said this Thursday in a statement published by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophe engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline is now taking legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed an appeal to the Australian Federal Court of Sydney, allowing further legal measures against the company.
Qantas’ chief Alan Joyce said his company would request compensation for the incident in early November.
Parts were released during the engine fire and they damaged the nose surfaces.
Rolls-Royce marked the cause of burn oil damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged around the world.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out additional security tests with huge aircraft that are equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to be informed by everyone concerned.
After an emergency landing, Qantas left its A380 fleet for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380 on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a security measure.
The two-stage aircraft is the world’s largest personal plane.
Full-scale snow causes chaos in transport
Germany was all in white: almost all over the country snowed overnight.
On many roads there is chaos, connections between trains and planes are broken.
At least three people died in accidents.
Winter frozen Germany: almost the whole republic fell on Thursday night at frozen snow temperatures, leading to transport chaos in many places.
In the north and east, it lies up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several roads and many roads, traffic is very limited.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in place, but it couldn’t manage a newly built snow.
There was a strong wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) expects a storm in the morning with a water condition of 1.2 meters above the normal coast of the Baltic Sea.
The snow walls have caused significant problems in Saska on roads and national roads.
According to the centre of the bad weather, Meteomedia was therefore the highest degree of inflation in Sachsen Switzerland - the highest degree at all.
From there, there were 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused hanging.
In the night there were several trucks and passenger cars.
Police authorities in Saska-Anhalt also reported serious road problems.
At A2, the wind and snow caused slow operation and crashes.
There were problems in Duryn because of snow on A4 and A9.
According to German roads, there is a great deal of difficulty in Saska, Saska-Anhalt, Duryn and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the wheels, reversed trees on the wheels or broken upper threads and motions.
Remote traffic had to be stopped in Saska from Lipska to Norimberka.
In Duryn Saalfeld, one ICE had to stop in Munich.
165 passengers received on the train from the hackers and rescues waves, food and drinks.
The snow wind wars across the road.
Many flights were cancelled on major German airports due to snow winds.
According to the spokeswoman, flight information centres have already reported cancelled flights from Munich.
Frankfurt am Main has been cancelled for 40 years, according to the spokesman of Fraport.
Maintenance of roads is in constant installation.
There are only few passengers left at the airport without connection, but 400 field beds are prepared for them.
On many roads, accidents occurred on Wednesday night.
One driver of a truck died at a railroad crash in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Norimberka: a truck was captured on the railroad as the vehicle was caught.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Norimberk remained closed until morning.
And to this end, a 30-year-old woman died after turning her car to Aschaffenburg on a busy road.
Meteorologists, however, have the good news: snow will remain in the form of light laundering, and therefore it will be carried out even in light wind breaks.
But the wind is lost.
Only at the Baltic Sea will be quick winds with the power of storm.
There will be a large winter - up to 15 degrees in the local area.
Deutsche Bank seeks to buy towers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to be separated from its mark: According to a newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Real estate could cost up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its company’s headquarters: the tower-dublings in the Frankfurt Banking Quarter have been modernized, while bankers have returned to their old jobs.
Now, however, the financial group obviously wants the cost of renovation again - and is looking for buyers for both clouds, as the Financial Times Deutschland reports with a complaint to the speaker.
Speaker did not mention the reasons for planned sales.
“We’re still examining whether it’s more meaningful to own or sell real estate and then rent it again,” he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany resigns its business headquarters in a short time.
The Bank took the tower-duty only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euros from its own fund investors and subsequently renewed them costly.
According to data, the energy rebuilding was approximately 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the “Greentowers” towers at a price of about 500 million euros according to the newspaper text.
Speaker said he was not determined whether the building was sold again to the assets of the fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of bubbles in the top of the dead
More than 10,000 people worshiped the memorial of the hills in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions below.
It is still unable to rescue the dead because the security situation is still complicated in the shadow.
Almost two weeks ago, a strong explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 seniors between the ages of 17 and 62 were downstairs.
In the chassis where the accident occurred, a sonda was launched, but she discovered no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend due to safety.
After the second strong detonators, the authorities and experts have found that the topmen no longer have a chance to survive.
The dead were still unable to be released.
Now they honor the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people were gathered in sunny weather.
They've been quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were built for the worship of the monuments of the hills, on which helmets, lights and the names of the hills were built.
Also pictures and personal things like clothes and surf buttons have found their place here.
On government buildings, flags were on half a jerk.
New Zealand hoped that the tops would come out of the "deep ground" on the surface again, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the memory event.
"But they never came home."
He can't get rid of his son until he saw his body," said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was wrapped down.
In addition to the Prime Minister and his relatives, several foreign diplomats also participated.
During the explosion of November 19, British and South African tops were also flooded.
The rescue officers started by burning a fire inside a coal deck on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the gas is dissolved, it starts cooling high temperatures inside the bottom, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, warriors!
Is the horror of the art movie?
Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, he attempts to re-enter the old border with his battle era "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he played "Walhalla Rising"?
The one-eyed Viking fighter (Mads Mikkelsen) gets rid of his torturers and largely kills nearly with the overnatural force of his opponents - it sounds ideal for young men who are looking for bloody acts, because our hero even helps our cruel and cruel ways of killing.
On the other hand, the single, as it is actually called, does not say a word during the entire film, and the other characters will pass at least one or two sentences or let them climb into passionate deadly screams.
Otherwise, he is silent and shouting in a terriblely beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland, which offers the cult of the world of Vikings about thousands of years ago.
The film is ideal for adult movies with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera recordings.
It’s good when the film has more target groups, it’s only a bad thing when they’re excluding each other.
Winding Refn, after recording his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered to be a Danish version of director Quentina Tarantina, but stoically prevents his works from getting closer to either more humor to the mainstream or less brutality of the artistic audience.
Most of the fans of the artistic film are apparently discarded by spraying brains and interiors everywhere.
The supporters of action films will be dismayed at the later time when One is released for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries from ships to Jerusalem and will remain alive in the air and the mosquito until apparently the team joins America and there remains silent.
It is not surprising, therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" did not come into movies in Germany and was released on DVD only.
It's a shame mainly because of the wonderful paintings, but also because, behind the particular facade, the places to the accumulated blood, it hides an exciting cinema that deserved some attention.
In this film it is not about dialogue or precise work, everything is an atmosphere, a hot dream that has become a film.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn does not stop him at any moment of releasing and slowly breathing him with his frozen pictures and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, above all but unwritten hatred that flows from the hearts of characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who helps the One, will leave something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all, the most single hero, whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and transitional allies as a warrior from hell, maybe a devil’s messenger.
It creates a destruction, but maybe only for those corrupted.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for excitement, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
Mysterious earthwork
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has announced a new warning on the secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the earth prevents expression - and does not even allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest largest city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documentation of the International Nuclear Energy Office (IAEA) appears to be its name when it comes to a reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that deviates from the current.
Based on a statement from the U.S. Foreign Secret Service of the CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would well throw into the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
The technology of the 1950s does not happen to anything else.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation explains where the reactor components could be before the destruction, it is intended to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear center Yongbyon.
In addition, there were still pictures that showed the building near or even from inside.
The reactor was shortly before the launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, it is not known much more than that time, even the fighters have increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memory that the CIA was very sure before the attack that Syria is building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no grounds that there is an "active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some reporters in Europe are even more cautious and only talk about a "sudden reactor", although the CIA's presentation is considered "valuable".
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he has a reactor in front of himself, the UN High Diplomat, IAEA, in the summer, has "a lot of material to ask questions."
The Syrians, allegedly "unused military buildings", were quickly cut off and also correctly arranged the field.
However, in June 2008, the IAEA team was led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar, which was produced by humans.
In addition, IAEA received satellite photographs from commercial vendors from the time after the attack, which should be higher than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market, because they exclusively bought an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
The IAEA cannot therefore confirm its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that she has never had a secret nuclear program and has not even built a reactor.
Uran comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus is expressed.
However, IAEA rejected this after the analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss things - as well as satellite recordings.
In addition, auditors prohibited the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the worm-bombered buildings.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on it," recently confirmed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case is inevitable since June 2008 and "is becoming a serious problem due to the credibility of the Office", as the high-western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - it is a serious violation of the nuclear weapons ban treaty that the IAEA is supervising.
The IAEA considers another three devices to be "functionally connected" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it still exists.
The auditors have not yet stated which device it is, which function they have, or why they are suspected.
According to the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, IAEA is internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, once again taken from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite images complex buildings, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
It is apparently located inside or close to the military base - for this reason Syria refuses access to the IAEA to these three places.
In Vienna, Syrians fought the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance to fire the military base.
Nuclear detectives were warned by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has the basics and also satellite images that between these three places and a quarter of the Euphrates material was transported here and there.
In Vienna, the high-western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is no "proof of sensitive activities", i.e. of enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium that is not enriched.
Where, however, the uranium comes from and where plutonium should be deployed on the bomb later, there are only likely estimates on these central issues.
It is also unknown whether cares that could hide important traces are stored in these three places.
The Jacobs disappeared from the surface of the hundreds of the costs of trucks, and no one seems to have the information from which the court came.
Only a few kilometers away from el-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the salt bulb of al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to check in 1998 as an appropriate radioactive waste warehouse, IAEA considers it unlikely.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley put him in connection with the reactor in one satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review.
Images from the universe show that after IAEA requested access, Syria carried out in all suspicious areas of earthwork and removed large containers.
It could have been an accident, but it couldn't help explain the suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circles talk about the IAEA spending many months in creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only these intentions show how much auditors are interested.
Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna have quietly said that the reactor was destroyed, and that is why it isn't worse, then the U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has spoken for several months about so-called special inspections, which is one of the hardest means for the Vienna Nuclear Authority to take controls.
The IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspection, has already spoken of the "options to which I will clone in the future", but is still involved.
This election is a major risk: on the one hand, there is a need for the majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, a diplomat said, "What happens if they finally find nothing?"
Love at the time of the war
Since Angelina Jolie began to work on still infinite directors in the summer, there have been difficulties.
She wrote her own script, this is the love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Not much more has been known yet - but it also causes uncleanness.
It is constantly talked about the fact that the woman who is a Muslim falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's union immediately protested, so the scheduled recordings moved quickly from Sarajevo to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film was touched in Hungary and is in post-production, but is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Women’s War Victims Organization wrote through the UN organization to help UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with the actress, they now informed the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also the UN Ambassador to help refugees.
It is not just diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they rejected it.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In camps where he was raped, love stories did not know, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the scenario.
As a result, her organization recommended the UN to help refugees to release Jolie as ambassador, according to Guardian.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has received its scenario, has allowed the Sarajevo filming of smaller Tannians - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not yet receive it.
The young author emphasizes that in his film he has not followed any political intentions that he has been committed to the conflict in Yugoslavia with great effort to show the terrible consequences of war and to give space to all stakeholders.
Because of the content, it remains uncertain.
On the internet, another version of the film sounds quite different: the lovers knew one another before the war and meet again when she is a Bosnian Muslim in the Serbian camp, where she serves as a guard.
What really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie’s film really starts before the war is true.
Jolie says there is a pressure on it that "is not fair and is based on wrong information."
She can now be released from Hollywood by publishing her screenplay on the internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
Tonight it's good for Irish again.
No trace of sadness.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans cry with joy for the sound of loud music, dumb feet.
Bailey-Pub in the Southern Cork Valley, because players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the beer balls - and climb.
"Beer Pong" is called a strange theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a win-win prize and to a flight to Las Vegas for the World Cup in the beer Pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this crushed beer game and a restrainable computer, it doesn't work too much together.
Nevertheless, a 26-year-old is trying to have fun, responding to difficult questions that will bring the future.
His plan is not a game passion in Las Vegas, he is going to talk to New Zealand in January.
“I have such a strange feeling of it,” he says.
"It's so far and I don't have a job yet."
Nevertheless: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "as soon as she gets her desperate job as an Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Due to the bad prospects at home, two out of three of the Tanner brothers have tried their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT advisor in London.
The boys leave: Like the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
The 100,000 Irish will leave the country in a timely manner, the experts of the Scientific Institute for Economics and Social Affairs of the ESRI in Dublin predict.
It even counts 200,000 migrants by 2015.
For a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a significant loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of immigration that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After decades of rise, which brought great prosperity to Ireland, the distress is now expanding again.
The economic crisis is mostly disturbed by young, educated Irish people who have so far only experienced a rise.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years.
Everyone was in need, the money was over.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are unemployed under thirty years of age.
In the Irish Times there are many letters from readers who complain: "Everything comes from the hills in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, the one goes away and our country will lose the entire generation."
"Let's last delete it."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish student union, sees the future in black because the government says only lies, and young people don’t offer any prospects for the future.
“They reduce minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” 20-year-old says.
She observes how her fellow students disturb from one unpaid practice to another.
Her greatest concern is that she will have to move on in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressed."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition offering a general service on the theme of work abroad.
“For beginners on the labour market, work abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps towards a career range,” says the manager.
On his website there are photographs of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The report is clear: working abroad is not a galley, but freedom and joy.
About what it is to build something else, Sean O'Donovan knows for six months.
Because a 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction of Germany.
It just builds a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he will continue to Hannover or to Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra currencies to pay home a home loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when the first time it exceeds the threshold of its own home for a long time.
“I make money in Germany for a home in Ireland where I’m basically not.”
She laughs and walks in cold rooms.
The small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought a house with his sister four years ago for EUR 380,000 - 100% financed with a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money were without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid that the loan shouldn't work well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, lowers hot tea and says, "I don't have children I should feed and I'm young; even if everything goes down, I can start again."
Construction engineer doesn’t like tears that they hear so often now.
“No one should be hungry – our situation is not even as dramatic as before on this island,” he says.
"As long as we work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and his life was gone in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner loves this idea.
Leave a open future and just wait for how life will evolve elsewhere.
He has been working in London for several years, and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there is another thing that makes him very worried these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
They are afraid she can turn to a wedding celebration.
“No feelings,” he says and drinks a lot of beer.
"Ay, it sounds alarming."
"Let's call it a celebration of departure, simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practice of Democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing, as well as the support of private business.
Criminal activity raises more concerns than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometry survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related matters.
The first of them is that Latin America has a relatively happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries on the Pacific side of South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been on average 6% a year since 2002, democracy support has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of the questioned in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most humanitarian areas, are the beliefs of Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents across the area expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, which is the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a significant increase (diagram 3).
About 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government again, it is the same numbers as last year, but it is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
10 years ago, the economic crisis of democracy in Latin America.
The support occurred during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and had a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the ratio of Latino Americans living in poverty has only increased in 2009 and declined again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood changes in a wide range from land to land (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its deviating President Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy reflect in the widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and the state of violent crime has worsened.
Only the second time since the surveys began, more respondents across Latin America are viewed as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see Figure 5).
About 31% say they or their close relatives have become victims of crime last year, but this is a decline in comparison with 38% of last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private businesses and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the area say that private businesses are necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow the development of their country to increase this percentage from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelan respondents have the same opinion (and 80% promotes private business there), although their left president Hugo Chávez is owned by many private companies.
Brazil is a country with a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (as compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9% compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and mostly Central America, while Venezuela is enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general elections in Haiti on 28 November to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders who are trying to help the affected country to fear.
The elections were full of urnes and repeated voting, voting tickets scattered across the channels, broken electoral rooms and terror.
Election room open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many who moved because of the January earthquake, walked around and tried to find out where they could choose.
Some of them finally abandoned it.
More than ten presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the cancellation of elections.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the highest-built UN official in Haiti, said that "it was in many ways a pretty good choice."
The observers from the United States and the Caribbean Community said carefully that "they do not believe that these irregularities, no matter what seriousness they had to have to cancel the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposition votes are bound by René Préval, an unpopular departure president and his candidate, Jude Celestin, is to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former first lady, have resigned from their original challenges to make the vote invalid.
The problem, however, may occur if Mr Celestin, who has a small or negligible support among voters, will be designated by a electoral committee for having reached a decisive battle.
Due to the regulating epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people who are still living in tents after the earthquake, they were worried that election participation would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented.
About 250 thousand identity certificates, which are necessary for voting, remained undivided shortly before the elections.
There's a lot in the bet.
The Dancers see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians will be planted on their own.
From the tops to the center
In weeks where she suddenly conceived, Cristina Fernández, Argentina’s president, enjoyed the public’s sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second functioning period in the next year can depend on whether Mrs. Fernández will give up the incompromisingness of her deceased husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs all will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had in the habit of compiling budgets undervaluing tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend more income according to the library.
Mrs Fernández’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition was separated and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on October 27.
Some members of the governing political movement of Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (which have been facing and accusing the government of corruption), Congress has failed to approve the budget for 2011.
"I don't want to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now be paid for the next year, while the president will have more space to spend according to the library.
The economy is overheating: this year it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about the numbers that are nearing 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who entered the office in 2003 when Argentina suffered from economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than for inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, loaded the private sector and cleaned INDEC, a statistical agency that joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now kill this policy?
She invited to negotiate between private businesses and trade union teachers.
And her officials say they want to limit wages growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise of global prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
However, inflation disrupted growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
This may be why Mrs Fernández says he wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government established an agreement with the debt holder who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina did not pay in 2001.
Mrs. Fernández is now facing an agreement with the creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this fact should not be supervised by the IMF as usual.
But last month, the Minister of Economy, Amado Boudou, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to be designed a new national consumer price index that will remind the introduction of the INDEC cleaning.
It is not yet clear whether Mrs. Fernández would want to stay in politics after the term of office is over, when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of churchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentinans from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win the next election, he will have to decide whether there is no need to quietly say so many of the opinions that her husband kept in politics.
Semi-encouragement for China
The Taiwanese voters are closer to the fort.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligibility, voted on 27 November the mayor and council of the city in five urban districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeo.
Mr. President Ma himself is the leader of feelings that dominate the fortress and have strong interference in business relations, including partially free trade agreements, in the largest comparison of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed the test, but just closely.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) ended with winning three out of five mayor offices, she failed to win a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), awarded Taiwan’s greater independence, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it was the presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his party's votes has been reduced by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was together with the KMT in urban councils.
The elections took place as the majority of Taiwan's elections, including noise-election truck cars and mass meetings with flags with spoiled girls.
It was also a compulsory mysterious attempt to attack.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chana, KMT's honorary president, was agitating for KMT candidates in the evening of the election.
The man from the dark shot the young Mr. Lien purely over his face, injured him and killed the spectator.
It was not strange whether the armed person intended to injure Mr. Liena or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that shooting affected the elections, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
The only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the fortress itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates asked about the plans for state housing construction and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threats of China.
The KMT has the tendency to avoid bonds with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also resigned since the rise of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and is aware that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, on his side, confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable for most Taiwan.
The Beijing government is expected to continue commercial payments, along with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the cattle.
China has not wasted time in sending the negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on the protection of investment and medical cooperation.
They would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It would be better to wait for the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, the DPP found itself.
Two years ago she was at a wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on the basis of an accusation of corruption.
The President in 2000-08 was a storm and defender of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Mrs. Tsai, a new generation, which is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms Tsai was called a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held the office under Mr. Chen.
Their side now does everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes serving as a contact place between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without pre-conditions.
Ms Tsai announces to the Taiwanese public that its party represents a "confidencial alternative" to the incredible approach of Mr. Ma to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be dishonored by this move.
In a statement issued by his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be able to do better if they would continue to be Taiwan a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to candidate for the president.
But even without Mr. Chena’s intervention, the DPP will fight for the choice of potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma’s assessments were bad, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be based especially on unemployment and profound collapse between the rich and the poor.
KMT speaker says he reorganizes his cabinet, as well as local branches.
The strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan for friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonia Chianga, a prominent publicist, "the point from which no return has passed away."
Grammy Award Nomination: Jazzo singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
At the request of the President and the people must legally notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony, is named one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with nomination to the best new artist.
Since Spalding was a celebrated character on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with the rules of Grammy, when an artist should not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is determined."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly recorded a step forward and thanks to her stunning vocal style and a hand-in-hand with pop elements, fun and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as the last year's success category that recorded in 2003 for this song Norah Jones, the closest song of the jassel.
Other Grammy porosity just awards Vijay Iyer Trio "Historicity" album in the category of the instrumental album, an exciting, refreshing ride of the album, which was the hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against the album of experienced saxophonist James Moody's "Mode 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a crafted favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO series "Treme" was awarded in the current jazz category, otherwise awarded to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with knowledge gained several merited recognition in the category of large files, when the Chamber of Jazz Childs Ensemble and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a hand-free man.
Nomination Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classical music
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53th anniversary of Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for the piano and orchestra, with the number of five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with the number of three points.
Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 “Los Angeles” appeared among the nominated in Southern California, the work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The founder of L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have the opportunity to award awards.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, including orchestral, operal, composite and solo recordings.
The classical music producer of the year has five nominated categories, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nomination for the classic album was obtained by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Chicago - The Concert Orchestra;
As for the categories of opera, Berg and "Lulu" are named from Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchantedsky of Wales" from Arthur and Maryhoat Cho.
Among the composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary songs include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salone's tactics.
The 30-minute work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is incarcerated in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental performance of the soloist with an orchestra.
The founder of L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute work specially for the Mandolino player Avital, who performed at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, has been nominated in the category for orchestral performance, for the leadership of Chicago Symphony when recording the work of Stravinsky.
Instrumental soloists who received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; craftsman Paul Jacobs; houslist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented this year by the nominated vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical transition category, the nomination of sopranistic Jessye Norman was won for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned mesh in Temecule receives approval of the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours, often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, on Wednesday night, the committee decided that the new religious center is in line with local laws and will be aestheticly impressive.
"A lot of good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews you remember," Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of it as an American citizen."
"This means that justice will always win."
"The opposition is minimal," he added.
“Those who are opposed are only shouting loudly.”
"We have really great people in our valley."
The negotiations began at 6 p.m. in the evening and lasted almost to midnight, when most of the time took discussions with people who were for or against the center. These voices were equally divided, Press-Enterprise says.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"There's no more America," one comment appeared.
"We're a planet of beans with the Socho of Liberty west into the sand."
"America's shut down."
The planned Islamic centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near the Ground Zero, the place of a tragedy held on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence.
His religious county, reading about 135 families, had been in Riverside County for years without an incident, but desired a larger and more convenient space than a storage space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new 24,943 square foot mesh in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and grow up to 43 feet.
It should take a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the City Council regarding the project.
Microbes with arsenal resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria, which can use arsen as one of its nutrients, expands the space for searching for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and arguing that it is a sign that life has possibilities that are beyond the main elements that have been considered as basic.
"This organism has a double ability."
"It can grow thanks either to phosphorus or arsenal."
"This fact is very strange, but it is not evidence that it is a form of real alien life," commented Paul C. W. Davies from Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared on Thursday in the online magazine Science.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sire.
However, scientists have found that bacteria discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growth after the arsenal is replaced by phosphorus.
"It's starting to get you all that is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is important for searching for life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life can look, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report published to discuss the findings, which did not reflect the details of the findings, triggered widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of alien life.
It's not like that.
“The discovery shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that move biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider as ‘standard’ may not be so essential for life,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, at the University of Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
“This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It wasn't a random finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiology Institute, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows a high level of arsenal.
Arsen and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so they thought that the microbes exposed to both elements could be able to replace one by the other.
"Arsen is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
“The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from themselves.”
"Nevertheless, arsenal is so different that it does not work as phosphorus does. When it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenal that bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in phosphorus action, but because they can also survive with an arsenal replacement, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenal may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or other planet or moon where arsenal is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, stated that the idea of arsenal that could be replaced by phosphorus is not a new, but never found an example to prove this fact.
Arzen was more common in ancient times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that they could take advantage of the former forms of life.
"This indicates that there could be other ways to create life, not just the way it created in the early Earth period," Foster said, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simon.

The remaining dogs were found in Compton.
Two of the remaining four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two acities and pembroke pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, spending a night at the Bellflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and two dogs were left on Wednesday late evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman of the Los Angeles Police Department.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which location, and did not share detailed information about their findings.
"The investigation continues."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We're following the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not arrested to express themselves in the case.
They had a great joy when their two acts were found in a Downey camp on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's representatives found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Trace, a three-year-old Trace dog and a 10-month fena Didi, were injured, officials reported.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained late until their discovery was late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in the city this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
Other dogs should compete in other competitions scheduled for days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek said on Wednesday to The Times.
Southern California is only one stop on almost a monthly pair of exhibits after dogs.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard went to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their truck in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - boxer dogs, Parson Russell terrier and the British cave - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened some windows to allow dogs to have enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported car stealing at 6 p.m. Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who will bring them to the missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn’t clear whether the prizes would be awarded on Thursday.
Lev is ready to screame again now that MGM restructuring receives final approval from the court
After 18 months of storms and uncertainty, MGM finally got green so it could start again.
The Federal Insolvency Judge of New York on Thursday officially blessed creditors' “prepaid” plan to compensate for $5 billion debt and thus clear the journey for a 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and television shows.
On Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order does not remain any legal obstacle to restart the founders of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the leading leaders of the last study.
The number of employees falls to approximately 320 of the originals over 400.
The MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to finance new MGM operations and production.
It is now a connection to the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and funding is expected to be around mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management how to solve its finances, as management struggled to allow interest payments of $300 million per year.
This August, Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Enron Director-General, and a trade expert, known for his work for Krispy Krem Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM financial problems and 140 students studied took much longer than expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several interests, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finance required by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the rising knife and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal events, the plan was finally approved by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially rises from the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive millions of dollars bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, who incubate for their company’s running services, $375,000 a month, will receive a reward for success, so-called “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restore production in MGM, which released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to participate in financing two films, which will be presented by the book "Hobit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share in these two films directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM debts, is looking for the possibility of combining the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
Nevertheless, recent negotiations between the two companies have not been concluded in an agreement.
Technical toys that keep your budget on gifts in balance
The leading candidate of this year is the most amazing iPad toy followed by a video game system, but in both cases this is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Think that at the price of one iPad you can buy five bicycles BMX for $99 and one Kinect game is worth as much as 10 coral shells or about 48 Play-Doh cells.
However, there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law works; this year’s technological toys have much more energy, at the same prices, if not a little lower than the previous years.
While relatively few new toys with associated sites have appeared, two of the most famous toys of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
The number of toys with button batteries, as well as battery chargers, increases.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except in cases that are specified differently.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are singers singing when you press them.
At one press, the animal will release a tone and the other press will begin to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start kicking, you can’t stop.
The best choice in combination with singing and dance is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated lady at Elmo Live technology, which can play the game Simon Says and also can monthly walk thanks to its innovative knife with wheel blocking.
Children test Mickey’s dance instructor’s toy, although their parents complain about lack of voice control.
If you are a child in the 80s, you may remember Alphia, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children aged 3 years), with a bag full of quiz cards designed to make the car ride a fun with a self-catering, fun work set.
If you send a smartphone to your child, there are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with easy-to-use, with qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with newer and brighter.
No versions are compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has a SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children under 8 years) is a set of five bones that are not larger than a burning box, each of them has a LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the bones in a series before the time expires; it is great for competition in the improvised form of words.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented at the highest level.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, 5$, for children aged 6 to 12 years old) containing hidden coins.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, wheel brush or Puffle animal.
A little bit bigger than your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano (10$, for children from 5 years old), the latest from a series of microrobots on the button battery.
The brook moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It’s fun when you make a sweater from the sweater and see if you can find a way out.
He is also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall from the kitchen table and even spend some time in the ground of our dog.
Delicate police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked through the square, strictly controlled his commands and issued commands with military authority.
He wanted that female members - Chinese state executives of the city's order, feared and defeated for their hard interventions and violence - mediate a certain impression of the proximity around them.
"Stand straight!"
"Speak up!"
Show them, shit silent, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive cabbages and shoes were placed in sight.
Four pairs of black shoes are classified as by reference.
The four head covers are perfectly sitting on the hair, which are perfectly tied to blue and white bowls.
"I personally think they look average," Mr. Tang said overwhelmingly.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to restore the image of city supervisors in China.
One city ordered the new gateways to have higher education.
The province of Guangdong transformed grey-green uniforms into allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China substituted for a strong weapon: in 2009, a report stated that 50 officers surrounded inaccessible trucks with cows and looked forward to the owners until the home dealer packed and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 6,800,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation to be the main image.
Since 2003, the district has complemented its city police with 13 women selected specifically according to their appearance, proportionality and young age.
The goal is to show, in addition to the hard side of the police, the softer, female side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have trouble getting into the secret Chinese city groups.
They would argue against critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, these policemen are allowed only to promote a city statement, to impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media usually capture different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from the Hubei province expelled an unparticipated viewer to death after using his mobile phone to record how they act in the intervention of a protest against the slaughter.
Last year, the training of police officers in Beijing took place, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the internet. In the manual was, among other things, a description of how to effectively defeat a criminal without signs of blood.
This year, a home trader of melonium in Shanghai got into a five-policy knife and suffered injury in the left part of the brain.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded on the internet shows Chinese police how they attack street dealers.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, a national edition, held last year after another discussion on tactics.
There was a "really thorough cleaning" on paper.
The skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, head of Beijing Evening News addressed whether women have real duties or are merely disruptive.
The answer seems to be from both.
The period demanded women aged 18 to 22 with a good character and "five face characteristics in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - therefore higher than 1.6 meters.
Service at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials say that work is psychologically too difficult for women over 25 years old.
"These images are important," said one of the most nominated police officers on Rednet.com, like government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine another, including height, weight, face characteristics, etc.."
Then it comes to a number of characters and "indoor quality".
Women are like flowers, he added, "Beyond they will be flowers, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the Governance of the District City, disagree with this description.
But he pointed out that height requirements are common in China for other jobs, both of which are in the case of gender.
Just like a requirement for a consistent characteristic of the face.
This means that the question of good excitement is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Health disability or freezing will certainly not apply.
"You can't allow a chrome or a backyard to serve us," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps the guard of the Baoguang square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like an apple and finely shaped mouth.
It is uncomfortable that an emphasis on her appearance may have a sexist race, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her co-worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just pushing traders into streets where they can perform their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten marketers who run walking or on wheels and try to sell as many tobaccos and tobaccos as possible before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times," said Mrs. Xu, when the trader began to flee, and for the time he left his bike with a car with nodes.
Police describe their duties as more monotonic than an excitement.
"Every day is essentially the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in her free marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that women's police officers do not have powers like their male counterparts to be able to entertain merchandise.
They can only threaten that this fact will be reported to their men's leaders.
The tendency is to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan province’s capital, woke up after fake news spread that the police killed the dealer.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were reversed or burned.
Xindu has yet to escape such violence.
But calm can only be guaranteed hardly.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baoguang square, where the police guarded that morning, more than 50 people gathered in the street corner.
Police took a motorcycle, which repaired the pedestrian place within the store, as required by the regulations.
The car owner could cry as he wanted.
A 15-minute departure from the policeman, forming a crash, with locks against vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned to hide his name.
As women's police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in image maintenance and cooling.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said.
"It's mostly a public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys of the Ministry of Justice have cleared Senator John Ensign from criminal charges regarding his affairs with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to ensure lobby, the Senator told the lawyer on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most severe legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevad, faced and who, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican candidate for the president for 2012.
Mr. Ensign's Office said that the decision followed almost after the yearly investigation was "certainly satisfied".
The Senator could still face disciplinary management at the ethical committee of the Senate.
Lawyers, Mr. Ensign, said that the Ministry of Justice "we informed that Senator Ensign would no longer be the objective of the investigation and that he is not planning to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to express the case.
The decision was a surprise for many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed there were serious evidence that Mr. Ensign prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times stated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, provide a lucratic lobby that led to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthie, about the Senator’s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a cashier in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their opinions after Mr. Hampton employed to hunt for them, so many documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently assisted by Mr. Ensign, he was excluded from the law from the lobby of his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts argue that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in contradiction with the lobbying ban.
Of the evidence published, "It has been revealed that it is a clear case of preparation for violations of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of customers who are investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers specialized in ethics said that the Ministry was cautious in the case of political complaints, after a large number of failures, including the decision of last year to suspend a complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens's State Release Center.
The federal prosecutors "haved guns clearly," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a lawyers group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign in this case.
"This is essentially indicating that the laws are not applicable to high-built government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief attorney of Mr. Ensign, told him that he was called by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice on Monday and then the second day, and told him that the ministry did not seek any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defence team cooperates with the prosecutors in an attempt to convince that, as his office repeated in a Wednesday statement, the Senator "consented in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he sent to the State Representatives.
"I'm not pleased to look at the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice except that we think they made the right decisions," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation of a separate complaint, in which the ethical group accused the fact that the payment of Ensign’s parents to Hampton’s $96,000 has violated the federal electoral law.
The election committee said it had no evidence enough to prove that the money was nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, the main Nevad company that long supported the senator.
A December 2008 e-mail showed that after Mr. Hampton began to act as a lobbist in the company, Mr. Ensign’s staff leader John Lopez communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he “was” in the Ministry of Interior regarding the topic discussed.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevadian customer, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to contract a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for the lobbying work.
Last year, when the report of the Afer first appeared, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned to his role as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After the many months of stagnation, Ensign reported to reporters two weeks ago that he plans to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr. Ensign no longer aims to investigate the crime, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said that Senator hopes the ethical committee will quickly follow the Ministry of Justice and end the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his efforts on behalf of the Nevad people," she said.
Cheshire municipality challenges on Twitter
In the courts, half a dozen of them wrote.
A minute later, they sent reports of terrible witnesses through Twitter.
Finally, the defense says more than 140,000 reports on Twitter were engaged in rape and attachment of children to beds in the house that was burnt.
Steven J. Hayes was convicted of the murder of three Cheshire citizens, Connecticut, family, and had to take place the official ending of the death penalty for which the court voted.
But Mr. Hayese’s lawyers have already filed a complaint with claims and arguments that the court would probably have been working for years.
One of the most provocatives is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the widespread use of the main reporters on Twitter - created a "circuit atmosphere" and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with disruptive details then introduced the court in a decision to influence the public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to deal with the question of whether new technologies will also require new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this transformation, I think there is a real danger that incorporating new technologies into the courtroom will affect the rights of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayese.
The judge Jon C. Blue of the state’s Supreme Court’s case briefly rejected the claims on income from last week and the fact that the media had been “checked closely” and there was no evidence that would indicate that the court acted under the influence of the public.
But it is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts recognized that the reporting of notoriously known cases could raise questions about justice of the process.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court revoked the sentence of Cleveland chiropractic, Dr. Sama Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard vs Maxwell, it was a "carnaval atmosphere" in the media process.
Some are convinced that this crime was the inspiration of the TV show and the film "Upchlick".
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts that reviewed Hayes’ judgment half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules could be necessary to determine the way of communication from the courts, which was inexplicable in the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a common reason to worry about the impact of new media" in highly monitored cases, John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out anyway.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be convinced that the limitation of direct communication from the courts can make the proceedings more fair.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many sharp lawyers of Mr. Hayes, who would be able to argue for years to refrain from execution of the sentence.
For example, defenders also claim that in the case of Mr. Hayese, when the judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential counsel by showing them a criminal photograph of horror when choosing a court.
Some prosecutors said they were frightened by the photographs of the victim who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
The defenders argue that they also refuse the Constitution of the death penalty and claim that the judge had incorrectly appealed the judge who had been critical of the State Prosecutors and that he had incorrectly imposed pressure on the dictatorship by his decision and directed the court to think about the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
In opposition to the dictatorship last month, they stated that the case dominated the reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign of the candidates for the Governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media constantly distorted the flames of emotions in this case.
"Day-day media, cameras and reporters were in court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that wasn't seen in New Haven yet, and maybe it was also a national rarith."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more stimulating than the reports mentioned later, and from their views the courts should manage the field of application of other proceedings.
But some lawyers have requested appeal courts with the often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr. Hayese's lawyers are striving for this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court’s judgment in Dr. Sheppard’s case, due to the widespread effect of the process, and wanted to clarify the demand that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is a Sheppard case vs. Maxwell 21st century."
Can patience overcome the fault?
After the campaign, which was remarkable with its aggressiveness and negativism, a small amount of distraction appeared this week in Washington.
Is this the first haircut of real cooperation of two political parties, or just an illusionary moment before the rapid return to the party struggle in the capital?
The final negotiations of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any critical findings on critical topics to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a deliberate discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party resignation.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the Chairman’s deficit committee was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among members.
It seems that it is clear that the close interaction has built mutual respect for several months, which exceeds the ideological breakthrough that members still divide.
It is quite easy to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in the testing period - they examine each other's signs of collegiality and compromise, striving to assess the boundaries of public opinion and election patience towards the renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday negotiations and its later assessment of the participants were also carried out with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obamo and the Republicans are too extensive and too deep to propose a rapid change in the ratios that have been here for the past two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are a miles away.
However, the November elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"It's no question whether regulatory matters have changed," Bush's director Pete Wehner said at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the elections.
The choices broke out the emotions of strangers and then quiet you.
It's good."
In several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have a small opportunity to find a solution.
Bush’s tax reduction expired at the end of the year and no one considers it favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, the likely compromise on unemployment taxes is only because Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction of taxes for property, while unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After Tuesday negotiations in the White House, there is already a greater optimism for possible agreements on these issues, together with the ratification of the new start-up agreement.
But William Galston from Brookings Institution notes that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship of two political parties when the 112th Congress is called for January.
It is more likely a period of accident, or even inevitable, he said.
"After things that must be done, psychologie will return to one of the confrontations in a short perspective," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely expanded - to the fact that sincerity will lead to real cooperation.
"I look forward to all the events between the present and the year 2012 as a shadow box where the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the creation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of envelopment, they know that they must behave according to their promises and have to reduce government expenditure and abolite the new law on health care.
These lines are clear in the initial responses to the recommendations on the deficit, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of certain taxes, the increase in pension age and the reduction of expenditure.
The joint President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken the role of one of Washington's most difficult tasks and have, in their opinion, developed the pressure on the issue of deficit to the public program in ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th Committee to be able to present their plan as an official recommendation and therefore to fight to get as close as possible to that number.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the committee who suggest that, in the case of financial issues, we have at least today, small grounds or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first begins next year in the form of party conflicts when Republicans call on Obama to resolve budgets, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the move?
Public opinion.
There are many evidence that despite strangeness in the last elections, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go towards the path, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be very closely monitored by the public’s reactions.
Anyone who threatens to reduce the votes will likely change the course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the thing.
Straitness and proportionality are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it appears that there has been a greater ideological breakthrough between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a precursor to the most important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the dishonesty that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of efforts on both sides to find common grounds in issues that still divide them.
The U.S. document looks like Moscow as an asylum for corruption
The city’s management is in the hands of “cleptocracy” and it continues to be part of the protection fees and fees coming to the Kremlin, defeated the US embassy in Russia in February records.
Police and the Federal Security Service are largely maintaining protective wings that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal trades but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical office" - takes its own when money begins to move on the top of the line.
The record, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on resources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when mayor Yuri Luzhkov was still accused of much corruption.
He was revoked by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then we have been able to observe only minimal changes in purity.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, have for many years rejected the allegations of corruption, and won several complaints for the cruel allegations of such a complaint.
In September, he said at the Russian television station, when he was asked for evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's a pigeon, it's a pigeon."
Russians with absolute belief believe that if their society is corrupted, it will be shown in voting.
However, it is unusual to meet such details in such a manner, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of that that diplomats from foreign countries would do so.
“The government of the city of Moscow and its connections with criminal lives led some to call it ‘disfunctional’ and confirm that the government works more as a cleptocracy than as a government,” the report said.
Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called krysha (the term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means ‘the roof’ or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Interior and the Office of State Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of Mos.
Analysts identified and three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is on top of it."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of Interior and the Militias are at second stage."
"And finally at the lowest level are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill out empty places in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report says FSB takes money from the largest companies and police are focusing on smaller companies.
"Owners of Moscow's trades are aware that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (more than from organized criminal groups), because they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while choosing money is complex, the protection itself can already have difficulties; even those that apply may sometimes be arrested.
For those who don’t pay fast enough, their shops are closed under different slots.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he did only a little progress.
The Embassy report talks about men carrying bags, possibly excited preparations, to the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucracy," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow research team, Indem in a recent interview.
"It's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
India estimates that corruption in Russia costs more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154 in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by Transparency International NGOs (the countries are ranging from at least to the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the report of the U.S. Embassy, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evenings, certainly did not cause enthusiasm to the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be accused of the Moscow shortcomings, it could be the possibility for Kremlin to argue about the problem.
In a CNN interview with Larry King, Putin said the documents published by WikiLeaks could have been fake and responded relentlessly to the statement that it was called by American diplomats Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the whole matter is that it is our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think that it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so unethical."
Veterans of the Red Khmers are forced to deal with the past
In a lighted concrete leaflet, he reminded the Anlong Veng High School director of Anlong High School of the man who built it, the leader of the Red Khmers Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
It is known as a "switch" for its crudeness during the rule of the Red Khmers, the commander of this remote state of the Red Khmers in northern Cambodia is popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers gave up the government, the long-lasting loyalty is also in Anlong Veng.
In April, the victim at the forum of truth and reconciliation was allowed to face publicly with people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided a library that explains the history of the Red Khmers and their former soldiers for the first time to children.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodia court will bring together the first sentence of the former member of the Red Khmers, the judgment of a former leader, the notoriously known violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years of imprisonment.
With all such progress, a disruption among the veterans of the Red Khmers in Anlong Veng, which complicates the efforts of reconciliation and their attempts to re-engage into Cambodian society.
"Among the former Red Khmers, there is storm and fear, but they are incapable of doing anything," said Chhang Youk, the head of Cambodia's documentary center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life between the Red Khmers was beautiful, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It's educating families."
During the Government of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were sentenced to death or died of hunger, disease or treatment.
When the Vietnamese attacked and defeated Pol Pot in 1979, the remains of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the partyan wars from their bases in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Venga.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. The large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which broke out the chapters of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of a natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who endured, was arrested in 1999 by government forces in recent Dangrek mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for a trial.
Their missionaries no longer cared about them, most former fighters of the Red Khmers fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgicly reminded of the time of movement.
Although several elites of the Red Khmers held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only a minimum benefit from the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, led by public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"There was a growing without any idea of carrying out a trade."
Sor Lim, 55, who entered the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"The Mok enjoyed everyone."
"But now life is difficult, because we have to ensure everything for ourselves."
The current court of the Red Khmers also raised concerns.
The court begins to investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court has the mandate to investigate the chief translator and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been told whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was only a little to calm down concerns in Anlong Venga.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the rule of the Red Khmers in the late 1970s.
In 2007, researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia said she was supervising the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project on which thousands of forced workers were likely to die.
Recent steam night, Im Chaem returned from the field work to his wooden house on a dirty journey outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows emerged through the trees, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Red Khmers.
If the court would appeal to her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable," she said.
"If another criminal trial appears, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed from the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court would seek further suspects, although experts and historians disagree with it.
"Cambodja has to crush a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentary center.
"Reconciliation in the Khmers means blinding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The centre issued the first book approved by the government on the Red Khmers, having 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the book of history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite connecting the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new library helps students understand the important components of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the library and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will beat."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, libraries and courts begin to influence, he continued.
The Red Khmers still have a strong magic here.
Upstairs in Dangrek Mountains, the road is grown by seeds and excreted with a pulled plastic bag that leads to a blanket of black seeds, covered with a cut-off roof.
The body of Pol Pota was burned on a tire collection after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile vendor on the street said he didn't know much about the man who was buried in that place.
"But I have a strong spirit, many local people here walking and praying for him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had her birthday and planned to visit Pol Pota’s rest place later, where he will bring a bunch of mature bananas in the hope that it will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to look like its weapon stocks on uranium
In the surprise victory in the Obama campaign on the security of nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are giving up their stocks of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint statement issued after the security summit of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
After years, the U.S. government has attempted to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium and seemed to have hit the stone of the crash last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the last two months a couple of secret operations were carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the soil for a Wednesday agreement to remove the residue of the material - about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke under the condition of anonymity, because this is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Summit on Nuclear Security in April, on which Belarus was deported.
And it was obviously a good will to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 nuclear security summit.”
"This proves that the process works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security support group.
Clinton called the deal a "very important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all its stocks of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
Twelve countries did this for George W. Bush’s administration.
During Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukašenko announced that his nation would never give up his uranium.
“We have a highly enriched uranium – hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium,” Lukašenko said.
"It's our goods... we don't want to produce dirty bombs and we don't want to sell them to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, a few months ago, Belarus joined the United States and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove white-russian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly cleared, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and liquidation facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out flying, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of which to deliver to the Belarusian Research Institute less enriched uranium that will fail to produce nuclear weapons.
"Everything was very carefully coordinated and managed on the basis of trust," which led to Clinton's signing agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, official of the Energy Ministry working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for the study of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons estimates this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the manufacture of weapons.
According to a joint statement, Belarus will strive to remove its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been stressed over the years, especially because of Lukašenko's cruel repression of human rights.
But the Wednesday statement indicates the possibility of gradual dance.
"We look forward to progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that more consistent compliance with democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and that is necessary for the country's and its population's progress," he said.
The Spanish government hasn't done any money with CIA flights
The Spanish government did not make any duties on CIA flights transporting prisoners of Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánamo through the Spanish territory, as the U.S. Ambassador expressed in his telegram in Madrid.
This results from the documents provided by the Wikileaks server of the El País newspaper, where it also says that the first representative of the then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vego has asked the Spanish executive to be informed and "can demonstrate that it has a proper supervision of foreign airplanes."
In June 2006, after a communication from the Council of Europe, which accused dozens of countries, including Spain of participating in violations of human rights, a meeting was held between Ambassador of the United States, Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Veg.
The Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's communication "evited Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vegová stressed that Spain has no problem with flying secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed" so they're not "unprepared," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Miguel Ángel Moratinos, former foreign minister at that time, said the U.S. ambassador, “the Spanish government wanted to give the matter as low as possible, but by being in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence.”
In February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González announced to the Embassy that, as regards him, he does not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the secretion of documents of the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA Flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminated folder or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns rather because of the "clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than because of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence secretion.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to address this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at lunchtime, Ambassador of the U.S. and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they think is appropriate," he already put the instructions to his colleagues with a loving-kindness.
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the negotiations of the political party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - known as translated) in this matter.
"In spite of its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular Party will not hesitate to use any signs that Zapatero’s government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible infringement of human rights, even in the event that this revelation may have negative consequences for communal governments."
Recognized mother-assassin complained about mother-in-law "agedness" network
A young woman talked about the baby when she was dead, and she had her blog: "Terror in Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls "Muki" on the internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both of them are from the village of Noia in the region of La Coruña, from which a young woman comes from.
Reports are from 2008.
In order to be able to understand them, you need to know the emotional life of a woman that the ABC newspaper rebuilds with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A thirty-year-old woman from Galicia joined a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunisia in 1998.
They went together for a year.
Shortly after she divorced, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if he was his newborn baby, but his ex-girlfriend never allowed to do DNA tests.
Soon you found a new familiarity.
Her elect was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their relationships took a long time.
The little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, she stayed with her partner, who even visited her for a week in Palmy.
However, from the contents of her communication, it is evident that the relationship has collapsed.
In March 2008, she was alone at Menorca and wrote, "Alberto is somewhat angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he must be with a little girl all day and can't do what he wants."
Then he talks about the sms she just received, "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where to send your child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like to leave a little boy with my mother, I'll take him when I'm back."
In May he talks about his return to his home: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until 19, because 20 I have to go for work so that I don't get to that place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son to himself.
"It will be with who it is to be, that is, with me, and it will never happen again in my life that I would leave him with someone other than my mother," a doubtful intention in terms of her bad relationships.
There is another post in July.
When the report is drawn out, the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and probably killed 10, is already dead.
"The Emperor is satisfied on the one hand, but on the other hand he is not."
"On the one hand, she is with me, and she really likes it here, but on the other hand, she goes to school almost every day."
They're talking about moving to Mallorc.
"I'll go there to the summer school, so I'll save a little money for the rest."
Seventeen greetings and complaints.
"Great mouth from Caesar who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what videos you sent on an email, look how he wants to meet me, sex is needed."
The third report says, “The boy is fine, he goes to the summer school to learn Catalan.”
There is also one report about Victor, his current partner: "He gives me money."
On the internet, Monicina posts on blosses devoted to anime and mans.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she was supposed to call herself "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Terror in Galician (motto)."
The last man with whom he lived, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because he didn't tell him that he was a free mother.
Mónica joined the province office in Palme, where she came from the prison center in Menorca.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, said that the accused doesn’t remember how everything happened and that “she didn’t intend to hurt a little.”
However, before he admitted that he robbed Caesar in the bath and put his body in the box.
Defence and prosecutor are asking for psychiatric examination.
People would win 4 chairs in the House and PSC (Catalan Socialist Party) would lose 9 mandate
With the results of November 28, the PP could have the main word at the municipalities in Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in votes and the number of experienced Members in recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (the People's Party of Catalonia) already has an idea of the general elections, whether it is normally increased or not, its prospects are even more than the number of votes.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610,473 votes in the general elections, while in the 2006 autonomous elections it was only 316.222.
Last Sunday PPC (People of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this trend is maintained by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculate that if the general elections are held, the PPC could receive 12 Members in the House against the existing 8, and the CiU (Convergencia and Convergence and PSC party) would also have 10 Members.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is essential for the PP and PSOE (Spain Socialist Labour Party).
According to this human analysis, the ERC (the Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would have lost one Member - now has 3 - while the ICV (the Green Initiative for Catalonia - ICV) would continue to have one mandate or, if possible, another.
However, according to the election calendar, the closest stop will take place in May 2011 at general elections, where people could also have a decisive impact on the end of the Socialist dominance in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), one of the largest budgeted 66 million euros in 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree with the possibility that the PSC could lose municipalities in Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where socialists would not receive the majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, ERC parties and ICV.
Given the deback of Republicans, it would not be possible if this party lost its representation in the Barcelona representativeship - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of votes.
The PP has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in turning in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Joseph Felix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP won only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoye - during the last campaign they met at several occasions.
People also acquired other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has a representation of 34 mayors in Catalonia and wants to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.

Seven Pakistani and one Nigerian who were detained by the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Djihadist cell managed from Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaida organizations in 2008, among which were also the "Teggles of the Liberation in the second group in the Tamil Islands", and "Tailland's Liberation in the second group Tailland" and "Tailland's".
The Ministry of the Internal Affairs is of great importance to investigate this issue, aims to ensure, by means of the "Campai operation" weakening the counterfeiting apparatus of Al-Qaeda at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that this cell could have been active in Catalonia in two years, send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then fake and then delivered to groups that form a criminal galaxy of Al-Qaeda so that their "fighters" could travel without penalty across the borders of Europe and other countries.
This broken cell was not the only active that the Djihad network had in Europe, and therefore, other European police units, besides Thai services, also participated in these investigations, and it is therefore impossible to exclude that other European countries will not have similar interventions in the next few days, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerie Babatunde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, where they were arrested by the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad and Niger.
These were the men who conducted a home cell from Bangkok in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, whose part was eradicated in 2009, stole particularly tourist passports that meet the requirements of Islamists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, had to have validated several years and had to have no visa.
In the investigation documents, there is no known facts that would link detained from Catalonia to a bombing attack, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thaj.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination was sent to the Catalonia transfer agency about $1,000, which were "incorporated" to purchase tickets on mobile phones, which later used the members of the "command" who killed 106 people.
Police have already enjoyed a lot of evidence.
People's Party (PP) calls for Mass to stop the budgetary agreement
President of the PPC (People Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezová-Camach had yesterday the opportunity to personally transmit to Artur Mash its conditions under which she is willing to promote its inclusion in the role of President of Generalitat; these conditions are consistent with those proposed during the campaign of the national economists, which is the priority of the recovery of the economy and their risk.
The Chairman of the Catalan Peoples came to a meeting with Arthur Mass with a certainty of 18 Deputy chairs received in the last Sunday elections, which is more than satisfying for the achievement of popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the forms of the opposition forms to stop his vote.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliance that nationalists would like to maintain in the House until the general elections are held, but the conversations that the Meat and the rest of the political leaders have been held in the spirit of the Catalan.
When it comes to President PP to get its support for entering the position, "he will have to end with all supreme and free speeches", as well as with an economic agreement - similar to that of Baskick - about which the leader of the CiU wanted even to vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to crash the overwhelming political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce heritage and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the Mass input to the function will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mass has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrerou (ICV) and today meets Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility ensures that deaths have not occurred as a result of "insufficiency of measures"
The Olot Center’s presentation does not exclude that their career killed more than 11 customers
The leadership of the geriatric centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to calculate the damage caused to the criminal behaviour of Joana Vily Dilmé, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least eleven seniors who had care.
The director of this home for seniors, Joan Sala, accompanied by the lawyer of the institution, Joana Canady, and announced that "the wish of the home of La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the murderer" responsible, but "the legality and liability of us undertaken by the relevant proceedings."
In addition to damage to the good name that this institution may suffer due to the fact that it has not undermined the criminal activities of the career in time, a major threat to the home of La Caritat is now the demands for material compensation that are already calculated by legal representatives of the remaining families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime has been committed in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing
The judge ordered exhumation of the eight bodies of the client home for seniors with suspicion that in many cases no physician personally looked at the dead but that – due to the age and poor health of patients – everything took place on the phone.
La Caritat rejected this extremity yesterday through its Director and emphasized that "the remainder of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened."
La Caritat said, “There is no evidence in the case that any third party would have made doubts in addition to its own accused.”
The angel of death now admitted 11 murders yesterday and stated that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 and killed the second elderly by a month and a half later.
In this case, death caused by administering too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case when a mixture of calming tablets was used.
Director La Caritat said it was complicated to control personnel's access to drugs.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six of the nine cases a means that this career used to kill patients in his attempts to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analysis that is currently underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila could and actually searched for his first victims for less cruel death or, on the contrary, murdered them by giving a loneliness, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
La Caritat does not believe in the medical claims and does not exclude that the number of killed may be higher than he admitted, and justifie their behavior in various versions that Vila filed to the court with consciousness that it must change his actions when it was revealed that he killed eight people.
Therefore, they say they want a lawyer to be available so that the entire scope of this issue is illuminated.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors responded carefully to the threat of the President of the European Central Bank of Tricheta yesterday, which warned that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The marginal differences closed with the power and shares of the European bank fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical for the non-liquid market, which, although there is a decline, is recovered - but thanks to short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take a while to lose concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank cited us to regain the level of liquidity today, and tomorrow will have to revoke the fourth in two years.
The Bundesbank requested the end of the State debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and elimination of all exceptional liquidity measures within a period of time and unlimited access only for one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be predicted "minimum until March" and to follow a three-month auction with unlimited access to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity by at least June.
We also hope that they will continue to purchase debt in their program and even announce its intensification.
If the expectations are not fulfilled, it will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to keep the level of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the meeting in May, where they claimed they were not even thinking about buying debt, and there was a collapse in the markets - tomorrow history could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and durable.
This was reported by the pancreas farm in May on Monday and on Wednesday that it had already purchased a lot of them, causing further crash in the market.
Yesterday’s exchange rate for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
As the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, it reflects a change in the mood in the market, according to Trichet.
Allied and the Bank of Ireland’s losses were reported in Ireland.
The estimated amount is about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other 15,000 potential, by February they will have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be executed.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem has not revealed stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the assistance plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to obtain approval of the new budget by Parliament and still lacks adequate support, so that uncertainty will continue to rule in Ireland.
Angela Merkel relieves the tone of her speech to release tensions in front of the next EU top meeting on December 14, which requires a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others prefer Beethovenov's Ody for joy.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action that will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction in deficits, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to restore employment - to the ears of investors it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Tricheta and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as other European storms.
Unlike February, the responses of the government and the Spanish National Bank were quick and convincing - we are probably excited from the impact of surprises.
Today we have a three-year debt auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we hope there will be a great demand for it, which will help spread doubts about our refinancing ability.
Request a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we do not need - in El Tesoro there is 40,000 million cash available, three times more than in March - further high rates and market access would be closed to us.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Caesar's women's strategy - "not to be that, but also to be that."
We can do that.
Eulen Group President attacks Vega Sicilia's negotiations requesting his children
A storm in an open conflict in the family of Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, does not use.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after considering him as a "fully unimportant", El Enebro's 16th-month-planned legal meeting and required five of his seven descendants, to whom they should try to force their majority and power themselves with the help of the administrative authorities of the prosecution of Sidegas.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José are a legal group for a new chapter of their dispute on the control of a part of the society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not appear to be willing to resolve in his dispute on membership in the El Enebro governmental authorities.
Five of their seven descendants, who had been appointed predators during the stockholders’ meeting on 18 January this year and whose objection was made in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro court meeting planned for the sixteenth of this month, which was appointed by the Officer of the Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, again restored the triumph of the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is the only legal means to guarantee the appeal of the Commission until the dispute is resolved.
The last step of Juan Carlos, Pabla, Emilia, Marty, and Elvir Álvarez Mezquiriz, David Álvarez, is considered to be "a desperate means of his five children serving by means of justice and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the negotiations of January 18 which were completely invalid."
These arguments will serve as a basis for the reasoning of the legal assault of this act as "completely meaningless".
The protagonists themselves, who quietly quietly, have already tried without success to hold the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group of owners next to other activities Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls the seven descendants of David Alvarez’s 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires 51% of capital.
This issue is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when considering the matter of the court's appeal. The date of this appeal has not yet been fixed.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software suggests improvement in real-time vehicles.
Since Red Bull entered Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
Initially, no one took the chances of this new arrival team too seriously, and despite the rising trend of recent times, all waged on Ferrari’s triumph Fernanda Alonsa.
Without having to reduce the riding capabilities of the champion, German Sebastian Vettela, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 was born a legend - a "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winners team.
In fact, this is a powerful software simulating the proceeds that the German company launched on the market in 2007 for very remote car sports.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in energy plants and for high-precision devices.
Its aim is to reproduce the product loyally or simulate the process before it is actually created, avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s camera, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most convenient utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, the leader of Siemens’ Industrial Division, explains that using this software, Red Bull’s team has enabled to carry out “in a few hours, almost in real time” modifications and improvements that are otherwise detected during the race and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992 employees have an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform up to three or four improvements in one period.
The Red Bull team is currently working on 180 highly qualified young professionals equipped with performing information technology that analyze and propose any type of racing vehicle modification.
Siemens’ leader explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine that Renault is fully responsible for.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using a laser and highly technologically advanced autoclave.
The only limit of this technical asset is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that each team can issue for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up about 50 km from London’s high-tech race to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are limited to visits - especially to journalists.
Everything that is happening here is considered a “great secret.”
The list of participants in this project counts 580 people, including two pilots - Vettela champions and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's headquarters in Formula 1 is without doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
With the insufficient technology that the brand of energy beverages has invested in participating in the race circles, however, other protagonists whose help is invaluable, while no one knows it.
Steve Nevey, chief of manufacturing technology, says five years ago, it was possible to say that progress in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the merit of drivers.
Currently, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% success, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing techniques because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will create 20 own stores in two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in collaboration with his business partner Pont Reyes opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the network of 20 stores of a range of 80 to 100 m2 that this international company plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing business houses such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte Inglés.
The Spanish Vice-President of HP Helena Herrer has introduced as an example of a newly renovated store at the Barcelona Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has adopted a plan to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Russia) and in Belgrade (Serbia), the third store in Barcelona.
Herrer did not want to reveal where other stores will be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also leads HP’s personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening the trades will still be the same - using local distributors who have expertise and expertise in the sector.
The North American company here consults with the exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also concerned with ensuring the sales staff.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be franchising, and stressed that the exclusive sales network aims to "enhance customer service, service to small and medium-sized enterprises when shopping, service, post-season service and even packaging".
The Barcelona Shop is part of a world-wide pilot pioneer program that aims to address any problems with computer devices in guarantee.
Online service is linked to the Technical Centre of Seating in Maastricht (The Netherlands).
“So we will be able to solve problems that may take up to two days within 10 minutes.”
"This system is specifically designed for SMEs and ordinary customers, since large companies already have contractual technical assistance," Helena Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell bets to steal a million customers in three years
Jaime Guardiola, more optimistic than other chiefs, a delegated member of the Banco Sabadell Board, believes that 2011 will be challenging for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, which will, however, be attempted to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects he will be able to earn a million private customers in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and thus to survive under uncomfortable economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
In addition to survival without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, the goal is to get a market share by taking over a million new private customers - respectively 700,000, if those who are leaving the bank are deducted, as to date and the institution has rather been hitting small and medium-sized customers than small and medium-sized enterprises.
This year, the bank has acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share makes for private customers 3.5%, while it is more than 10% for corporate customers.
Another basic idea of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or it can also be said to be screaming, in order to reduce the costs of the bank’s challenges to present the results for the period.
At this time, few banking institutions will dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all global banking plans.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally three years, but the situation in the markets required extensions for further periods.
Customers who leave the savings will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "heavy and very important".
It is believed that the journey from the crisis in Spain will "be long".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very easy to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector.
And although he believes that the passive war - which reduces the margins - declines, the price of the risk that banks and savings pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity - is already shifted to the loan prices, compensating for the margin reduction.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will represent a pressure factor for loans.”
"We haven't shut down yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increase differential prices - see CincoDías from 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking is "now the reduction of commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not free of charge that in Spain "there will be required larger sizes."
“We won’t stay on stone next year,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "adequately reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions enter into red numbers.
And it indicates that FROB can accumulate funds on the market before a new capital measure.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive temporary market closing, it continues to be a serious problem with what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He recognizes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to receive short-term funding with the repo rates, which relieves the crisis.
CECA excludes another merger wave
The Director-General of the CECA rejected yesterday that another wave of merger would be savings, and resumed the speed of the reorganization of the sector.
When the process of association of Spanish societies began, there were several institutions ensuring that the first phase was unparticipated and waiting for the second wheel.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Spořitelen (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out that there should be a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, Cajasolu's inclusion in the Banca Civica group cannot be considered a second round, which is the conventions for what is happening."
"The majority is fully carried out; instead of 17 institutions, we can go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already finished and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, who worked very well in this matter," the Director said.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting (Association of Chief and Executive Officers of Aragon) Olavarrieta calculated that the process of concentration is carried out "with the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as it appears in the payments that the bank has been making in its time, not now, in business plans."
“Support from 45 assets with an average volume of 28,000 million to 17 to 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are bigger and thus falling in line with the Basel Treaty,” he said.
Olavarrieta admitted that "there are a number of unpleasant opinions on the slowdown of the process" which indicate "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank does is a reminder that we must be before the end of the year in the deadline".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most urgent financial system in Europe and "probably" even in the world, and those who doubt it condemned "a lack of knowledge."
The Director noted that in the present-day favorable economic situation "we can be quiet" with regard to financial institutions and the savings system which managed the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "with the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking industry was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and Red German Lines
Berlin decided to retain the euro, but laid down conditions for the entire Union.
The tensions in the markets led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, from reducing taxes for SMEs, through the regulation of private intermediaries or abolition of EUR 426 for unemployed, up to 49% of the AENA (Spain's Barajas Airports and Air Conditioning Management) – 30 % of the airports and the flight management – 30 % of the airports and the state of Prague.
With the support of former Prime Minister Felipa González, Vice-President Elena Salgadova joined the criticism addressed by Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to resolve the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
Be said in advance that Merkel’s opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is, which implies the idea of adherence to old traditions, which is kept by a large portion of other members.
In the face of the European resistance, Germany begins to speculate about three possible paths from the crisis.
The first of them is a strong eurozone, which would be part of Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is the return to March - although it can now be seen as a scifi, this version has a broad public support, nearing 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to German proposals, the euro reprocessing with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigidity, fines for criminal states, possible delays of payments for some of them, and the expansion of possible regulatory costs for the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a while, so now there is no space for drawings.
First of all, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled out of the hand of constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (the fiscal rigidity plans and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
Secondly, this Central European country showed when Merkel painfully excited decisions on the rescue of Greece.
It was already the subject of acute criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which was also published, were strong against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again appeared with a clear opinion asking the European Union to reform the Conventions in order to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time to have a private creditors’ obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, although slightly moderated, has been approved, and within the next few months we should follow the reform process of the Union, which should be able to allow these measures since 2013.
Germany has pushed a red line that is unwilling to cross.
And it tells all of us that although it is now necessary to take measures, which apparently disagree with, it will end with the old functioning of the euro from that date.
2013 will represent the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce delays of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to give ourselves a strict way of growth by increasing the rates of savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on claims and construction, with enormous downturns in the payment balance that Spain ruled in the years of the boome of growth, is simply not tolerating.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand that.
This is not only a recurring of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions we might be wrong with ourselves.
Hopefully these current turbulences will replace more calm.
Let’s take advantage of the opportunities they give us until the spring 2013.
It appears that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood it and his double statements (reforms promised after meeting large businesses from last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicate that through Merkel’s criticism, the path of thinking has opened.
However, the red line that Germany has pushed is here, and it doesn’t seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibilities that can be considered, the departure of the eurozone cannot be completely excluded from serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that he has warned us.
Sports and Overcoming Rules
The fines that Alonso and Ramos presented in the battle against Ajax show confidence, not intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonsa and Sergia Ramose) in the 23 November Champions League against the Ajax match has led to the ink sea of whether or not it is a non-sport behaviour and whether UEFA possibly should punish both football players.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won) nominated players were deliberately losing time each other at a time when the faul had to play in order to provoke the judge, and the other yellow card showed them.
In this way, both players will fulfill the punishment prescribed in the next match against Auxerre - while Real Madrid ends in their group in front - and will be able to continue to the next stage, freed from the cards.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Commission gave coach José Mourinho a fine for two matches, and the players were charged with a fine.
Production of yellow cards under similar conditions is no new practice, but is less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are not written but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case came from the fact that the Real Madrid team (which in his hymn praises honor and honour, and who has already punished his players for similar deeds), and also, as it seems, thanks to the drama led by Mourinho, which thus adds to his long history of the comedian and provocator.
In any case, the debate surrounds whether this type of action, which is not explicitly prohibited, is in contradiction with the principles of sport, or whether these actions are in violation of the law; it is in fact an action that respects the rules of sport, but the meaning of which it appears to be, is attempting to obey.
It is determined what kind of harm such actions affect the sporting spirit.
One of the relevant aspects of sports behaviour is the physical intactness of the opponents, which were not infringed in these cases, or had not occurred a violent game.
Another of these characteristics of the pure game is to avoid that players have an advantage to the opponent's team thanks to their offense - which is not there too.
The paradox for the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as a staircase or infringement of laws has not occurred to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but that behaviour should be as visible as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The other question is, however, what benefit will the criminals have from their intentional infringement.
It is necessary to note here that the competitor is not at a disadvantaged position, and that there is no benefit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have less players.
And that’s not even a useful strategy for another match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage is obviously that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, this is the advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and beyond that, players will refuse to be punished, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which to exclude only one card is less than in the first round.
So how the wheels will continue, it is not completely clear whether this is the advantage.
In short, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is part of making strategic decisions that will allow maximum benefits within the rules.
In the case of which we are dealing here, the players should not have the purpose of avoiding a penalty (which would be a clear case of infringement of the rules), rather than choosing to undermine them.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding the punishment or escape before it.
Although the limits between trust and respect of rules are not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly a trust.
It seems to me that polemics arose for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way the transmission of instructions to expel them from leadership.
Injury to sports principles by these events is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fight offers for organizing Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar will concentrate this year's reserves on 16 and 17 December.
The celebration of employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros is rapidly increasing.
Like the Turkish honeymoon or lottery, with the coming of December, Christmas partys are coming again, which continue to act as a oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis, they have emerged in the struggle to obtain customers by reducing prices: nearly everyone wants to spend the sector on 20 to 30 euros for food.
In order to complete the complication of numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when the Sunday day falled on Friday) requests for a week from December 13, resulting in a laminate of reservations for days in the top (16 and 17), while almost no traffic in the previous week.
As it has been since 2008, when the late years began, many companies have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave traditions, many employees pay out of their own pocket party.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices on the margin of profitability, says the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona restaurant, Gaieta Farras.
Representative of the restaurant facility patronage at this moment does not dare to predict what celebrations will be this month.
"People will think well before making a reservation."
“They want to go out, but when it comes to the price, they’re careful,” he adds.
Trades will go well to those “which offer quality and good service at an affordable price,” she says and reminds that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go down to a degree and most of the customers now want to spend around €25.
A survey in various facilities shows that the biggest effort for booking requests is on December 17th evening.
The Soteras Group announces a real booking boom on Friday, with the most demands to be paid up to €30, customized by the menu offered with a total price of €25 to €30.
In another significant company that is Andilana, reading 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda, etc.), has brought the specialty of this year's more early bookings since early November.
“We have made it possible to maintain prices last year, and our menus, each of which should be selected, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
In the AN Group, including El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after recording a profit increase from the second half and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas markets.
Sources of this company emphasize that December 18 will also be a challenging day as Christmas celebrations will be held among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they recorded the tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish bottled wine - transl.).
They also noticed that companies are already coming up that will again call their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is a bit bigger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Free Time Center in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that she begins to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "relivered", although customers "contract to maximum".
This impression didn’t even come up during Christmas celebrations, no matter who paid, indicates.
Pakistan’s nuclear program has emerged in the U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks confirms links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published by Wikileaks, confirms an extraordinary disaster that is stirring up the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and important details offered on the content of communication and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomatic diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two States in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "there is no departure," and that "the state does not depart from any state."
The specificity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled, but stored in pieces to relieve their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington’s caution.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in a report before visiting then National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, alleged dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
Increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and controlled shooting programs is no longer observed only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a spreading and representing reason to be observed.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with strict religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or controlled shooting programs," said an expert from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs Jurij Korolev.
Julian Assange’s biggest news documentation is the increasingly lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the issues of the dissemination of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
The Embassy issued in May, which qualified for communication with Pakistan as “frustrating,” says: “Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsive or are rejected.”
In a further report, Peter Lavoy, an employee of the national reporting services for South Asia, stated that "and through the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country in the world."
Ambassador Petterson also calls for Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani's Army chief that "Pakistan's army must end with quiet support for terrorist groups."
She's the boss of WikiLeaks.
Obama appoints a highly built worker responsible for fighting terrorism to avoid new information escapes.
Interpol issued a "red challenge" in order to track and determine where Assange could be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to find certain facts.
Interpol announced yesterday the "extraordinary challenge", i.e. red notice, to "localize and monitor the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classical detention order.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates to November 20.
It has no concern with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founder’s lawyer Mark Stephens assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang.”
It was November 20, when the International Police Office, headquartered in Lyon, France, issued this order on request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 countries of Interpol have guidelines on identifying or localising Assange "to put a temporary link to it and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person relating to the red challenge, many Member States, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called "red notice" to allow the detention to be made - it must be ensured by the national police - particularly when both states have an agreement on issuance should be detained as England.
This step has worsened Asseng’s lawyers who published writings yesterday, declaring that the founder of Wikileaks, a nine-year-old, has expressed his willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities using a video conference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to the legendary Lavrentius Pavlovich Bery, the chief of Stalin's security.
“This is a hon and not a legal persecution,” the letter says.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother is hateing the innocentness of his son - Assange is still in an unknown place, but not quiet.
On Monday, he provided via Skype from an unknown site interview to the head of the Time magazine - in this interview, he requested the demission of the U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton.
“If it proves to be responsible for the U.S. diplomats’ orders to carry out spying in the United Nations and violate so many international conventions that the United States has signed, it should resign,” he said.
His opinion was denied yesterday by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demand for demise as "laughter and absurd."
“I’m not completely sure why we should care about the individual who operates the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself entrusted a highly built worker responsible for fighting terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent further evasion of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to cease to add Assang to the importance contrasts with the views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chaired by the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber, has asked the Foreign Ministry to examine the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations, "to be able to interfere and strike anyone who would financially contribute or otherwise provide assistance to them."
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s adviser, said Assange should be “killing” and then revoked.
"Obama should write a reward on it or use a non-pilot plane or something like that."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a baptism priest, the former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever is in the government, whoever is responsible for evacuation of information, has been betrayed and any other punishment other than punishment would be too mild," Fox said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by "beating" on the Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on its settlement.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós has apparently found a recipe to fight the already several internal revolt in the ERC series (the Left Republican Party of Catalonia), unexpectedly due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture regarding the demise seems to be insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Roviry, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot absolutely make such anxiety as he had with other missing currents.
Hence, Levice’s leader will try to get new criticisms by killing, which will help him to turn to the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to secretly speak to its standing in office.
Using voting tickets, not lifting hand.
If the supporters of Caroda want to send a criminal voice to the President, they will be able to do it without fear of legal action.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid dismissal and deceitfulness of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered to be confirmed with half of the votes and one more, but added without specifying the percentage that there would also be no good outcome after Bulgaria.
Caroda’s staff demands more than to make their role available – which they consider is a gesture that does not have any weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body on the meetings.
But since they don’t have enough majority to force demises, they will try to make an executive reminder of the plan from now to May.
As a result, they are expected to participate in the drafting of a document on strategic reorientation, to which the head will be allowed to vote to the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise to move the Congress in autumn 2011.
The leader of the ERC stated that "multi-voteness" damages stability and that its aim is to make an organization able to wash its dirty clothes behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it appears to be a distinctive article signed by current adviser Josep Huguet on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós’ ideologist, this innovation adviser considered the finished thing that the leader would be confirmed "by exchange for several goals".
And he named five of them, two of whom are excellent.
The first is to "overcomposition" executives in order to represent at least 90% of members, which means that they also include new faces from the Carodovy sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC complete its completion through the meeting as a mechanism of functioning.
And so, he struggles for the reform of the provisions so that Congress can be held through the votes of the elected delegates.
The ending of the model of the meeting system, an exception to the Spanish political system, is the intended goal of Puigcercós’ team, who has already fought in this direction at the last two meetings.
However, the 2008 Criminal Assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on reforms of the Statute.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party reflected the resolution of this issue.
Now, without any critical sectors, it could be a good time to re-engage this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the newspaper MILENIO, Mexico has seen a decline of four cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders, there are three cases of women and a pair of separate bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, in Mexico, they have read about 390 murders, probably associated with organized crime.
Among the cases is found dead in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three shotgun wounds, further injury from grace to head, and had hands and legs stretched with the chain.
The next day, the body was found in the baggage area of the vehicle above the street of Mixtecas, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in Naucalpan district.
Earlier in the morning, on Thursday, November 4, the companions discovered the body carrying signs of torture and at least three deadly shots in the breast at Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal in the district of Villa Guerrero.
In addition to the body, the report was signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, a fifty-year-old man in Nezahualcóyotl was killed by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting waste.
On the seventh of November, two 30-year-old victims were killed by fire in the head in San Pedro Xalaxtoc, Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, a remote road in El Naranjo colony was found the corpse of a man shot in the head, and under the body was found a container from the weapon of caliber 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the wastewater channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
The rescue components conducted a thorough search for other parts of it, however, they did not find them.
The residents of the Tepotzotlan reported the finding of the body with the hands tied back and shaved head in the place of Pena Colorada.
The man was injured from the gun on his hood.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in a bed wash and left in the luggage area of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, as well, death-threatening reports.
A day later, it was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in Los Reyes La Paz district a carton box containing human head.
The rest of the body was found in a nearby colony, packed in a black plastic bag, with a report from El Incorregible.
On the seventeenth, two dead women were found packed in a bed wash in the Zoquiapan district of Ixtapaluca, and on the other morning, a man was found packed in a yellow-blue shelter, which was previously identified by the report the killers left with his body as Mario.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman without signs of life was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the skin of the woman was discovered the tattoo of the sacred character of Santa Muerte (literally "Santa Death" - translated) and also the necklaces with her pattern.
At the end of the month, in the village of Zinacantepec, a man with at least third shot wounds and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the car.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had a sharp belt were found, and the report was also found in the town of Puente de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victim, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, in which it said, "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
Two bodies were found in Ecatepec, carrying signs after torture and having a linked end, inside a left taxi at the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl districts.
The first one was complained and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed into black plastic bags, bound with a tape and had a report left with him; the second one was packed and found in a plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, agents and tickets were found with the report.
China’s goal is to reduce greenhouse gases
At the UN Climate Change Conference COP16, the representative of the country said its country had developed extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon traces, and said it would continue to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, said Su Wei, a representative of the country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
In its first public presentation at the 16th conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had developed extraordinary efforts to reduce the carbon trace and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past four years.
However, he said China would not change its goals and will continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategies are divided into the following four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support of pilot programmes.
All of these points have already seen progress, including the approval of last year of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities have cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their energy savings, efficient use of energy and emission reduction objectives.
In addition, as he said, various multiannual plans have been completed or have already been completed, which are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, it is a programme for efficient energy use that has been introduced over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations, government, and private initiatives.
The provincial project for climate change is also running, furthermore the project for saving lights exchange and the project for relief and adaptation.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert adviser on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were larger than they generally think.
For example, greenhouse gas emissions per population represent 6 tonnes in China, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and is expected to achieve further progress by 2020, he added.
Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party - translated) said that the former Chairman of the Party is entitled to request the National Ordinary Committee of its rights.
PAN President César Nava Vázquez assured that Manuel Espiny Barrientose’s exclusion had been closed and that the former president of this party was entitled to contact the National Order Commission and to claim his rights.
In an interview, which was filed before the opposition to the Governor of the State, Gabinem Cué Monteagudem, he said that Espina’s exclusion is, in any case, a decision taken at local level.
"This is the autonomous decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to contact the National Council in its case through a complaint in order to be a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that it is no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table for the alliance of presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will be reinforced from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December following which his successor will be elected.
"This (alliance in 2012) is a subject that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not at the moment, it was the intention of local elections that had succeeded and met its goal," he said.
PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and "we are not curing internal competitiveness, we are exploiting it and strengthening us," he added.
He said that the committee could choose the best president or president that the PAN deserves for the next three years, so that it can give the staff to the "who the committee appoints."
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, with the pride of transferring any of the five to the president of the party."
He predicted that the rise that the party recorded in the last July elections will be reflected in the future knocks, although "there is no time to think for 2012".
"It is now necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments with roots in the alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe will represent the flag and will be subject to observation throughout the country, because "they are put in many expectations and trials, and I am sure that Gabino is sufficient with these expectations."
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, translated) for his four-year speeches that he ruled, César Nava invited PRI members to think about the six-year periods of Salse de Zelatari and former Presidents of Erne Erne.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the government of Fox and Claderón, let them begin to defend them, let them leave their streets," he said.
He said that the federal executive boss has the right to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Audit, as no ruby or censorship is used in this country.
Obama promotes a law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you believe that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined his Twitter social network account with a contribution to national mobilization to support the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you believe that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and urge them to approve this law," Obama tweeted.
His short report notes the internet link to a wider document that requires the public to immediately join the senators as the vote on this law approaches.
"Because the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block approval of any law, unless the extension of Bush’s era tax reduction and government funding is approved.
Such blockage, announced by the signature of 42 Republican Senators, could affect voting on the Dream Act and other projects, such as ratification of a new nuclear-weapon deal with Russia, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman expressed his belief that as soon as the fiscal issue is resolved, it would be possible to set up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year."
I believe we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter at a certain point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters,” he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" regarding the Dream Act so that a proposal to legalize students without documents could be voted in the Senate since Thursday, although it is more likely to be next week.
The Senator's Dream Act, or the American Dream Act, would legalize approximately 800 thousand young people who came to the United States before completion of 16 years, lived in the country over the past five years and were admitted to a higher education institution or army.
However, candidates need 60 votes to approve the draft, which is why they need help from several Republicans, so that the organizations of their supporters carry out intense agitations to ensure the approval of this Act.
Democrats, mostly supported by the Dream Act, have 58 mandate.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, expressed his vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, MPs of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the most negotiations are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the departure senator from Florida George Lemieux, who complemented the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utahu and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but said they would no longer support it the next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed itself at this time.
Although the House of Representatives are appealing to another version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with the literature inserting the finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated " insert the finger in the wound" is the period of Czech "wrap the grid on the head - known.)
The second cycle of Enjoyment from the language was a promenade, where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... The finger to the wound? What's waiting for me?" said the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start the second cycle of Enjoyment from the language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in the Spanish language, and explained the question of the table as the table at this occasion.
The finger to the wound "will bring us into narrow," a literally Argentine writer told the audience, composed mostly of young people who went to the Guadalajara International Book Fair to listen to this debate at the tower table.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that was devoted to Gonzalo Celorie, and which Schultz later labeled as a great story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist who, in search of knowledge, goes from a doctor to a doctor from whom she does not receive the answer, although the foot of that.
The infectologist is convinced: “Patience is not my strong side, maybe it will be my wound.”
Finally, after frustration with the traumaologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalytic who reveals the mystery: "The wound represents it truly spread and therefore symbolically is the noise."
The protagonist slowly lifted up and concluded that "the wound she only managed to learn so much that she was really disrupted and that she does not exist", but she gained the conviction that pleasure and attention in the language must go hand in hand together.
The writer Valenzuel played with both of them.
Nicaragua Sergio Ramírez also came out with a lovely story, named Chloe of the invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but will appear at one point.
with the elements of magical realism he tells about the famous magician who played the clouds, brought back people who went far, or repaired the honour that one virgin lost, this story that then turned to speak the Americans, a great novel that overwhelmed the Divinity, in which the Divinity was missed from the beginning, and covered the feelings of his own divinity, who were divinity.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the fictional testimony that was presented in stories as a real, but in a different way he has never been able to tell the story of America with such an imagery that even lost the study."
Nevertheless, he emphasized, "they are crazy and liars who have greater imagination" and exactly where the facts and lies break up, where no longer knows what belongs to one group of stories, and what else, the fictional literature reaches its top.
This is called a "cervatish tradition".
"Thanks to his reference we have what we have."
Mayra Monter later emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the International Book Fair with her word Finger allowed to injure.
The Cuban-Portugal writer showed his finger on the big injury of social violence that passes through her country - and shares it by Latin America - and is a consequence of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think good literature, good poetry and good songs close a quiet compromise that of course is not thoughtful," she said after saying that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of a compromise that creates between the author and the reader - and in their "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "on this finger to the wound of a writer bound by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and consciousness control that overcomes dogmatism, it is forgotten that "they are hidden behind every approach, not small, and behind every reject is also small."
“To be the master of our thoughts and reality we need to color: and coloring means putting your finger in the wound many times and torturing those who are much more comfortable, because they think in caricatures, black, fixed and without coloring, and also torturing the authorities who prefer this black and white world.”
Romano follows his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, experienced good and bad during his career, but has already managed to achieve three opportunities for a decisive series.
In the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duo in the final, there are two different styles that characterize their technicians, teams that have a visible difference in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he experienced good and bad during his career, but has managed to achieve three decisive series at the time, but he has left with uncontrolled until now, and that’s why this chance is exceptional for him.
Argentina had to satisfy the silver medal, remained a step behind the winner and played curiosly with the same team the next final.
The Santistic Strategy, as a coach, came to his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament, when he was in the hand of the club Morelia, with which he held a total 4-2 against Toluce; then he again entered the decisive duel in the 2003 Clausura tournament and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the team Ray.
Already with Santos Laguna in the 2010 Torneo Bicentenario tournament, again against "The Devils" from Toluca, Rubén again suffered a defeat, although his team played against "The Officers" (a further surname of the Deportivo Toluca 4-player had the chance to win the win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win-win
Rubén has already lost two finals against the Red Devils from Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he could celebrate the title for the first time, although he says it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to laugh at statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm bound, and the title would of course be for me, but it's the most important first," the coach said when he was discussed about the numbers that talked in the final against him.
in the live memory of my previous finals, in which, as he confirms, a lot has learned, "we have taken the teaching that until the arbitration ends, we cannot celebrate, we have to be prepared for the action, as well as players, because last two penalties, we have already been ready to celebrate, and I think we haven't been able to celebrate this game."
He is not worried that this series could decide in criminal shootings, believes his players: "Never try to get into a series of criminal hills, try to end it in normal time, but sometimes there is no other way to be prepared for it, but it is necessary to be prepared for it, in the past tournament, we are ready for it, we are ready for it, we are ready for it."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second and taste the first time the titles bring.
The United States amends the rules for the sharing of visas
People will have to turn to the Centres of Service for Visa Applicants before an interview at the Consulate Department; costs will be lower and the waiting time will be shortened.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa negotiation process will be changed at the U.S. Embassy and consuls.
with the new procedure, most applicants will be required to contact the Centres of Visa Applicants Service (abbreviated from the English ASC) even before an interview at the consular department.
The ASC staff will receive the biometric information of the applicant and will be assessed by the consular department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total expenses for visa delivery will be lower, no longer paying the fees for the agreement of a meeting, the second for the processing of the application and other for the delivery of the document to the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only one fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa application (including a visa for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to restore their visa will not have to conduct a conversation with the consular official, but only turn to the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and will be picked up fingerprints.
Since biometric information will be collected in ASC, applicants who will require a second meeting at the consular department will spend shorter time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who will apply for a visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra charge for the service of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The U.S. space agency called for a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a break in search of alien life.
The U.S. National Office for Aviation and Space (NASA) will announce a astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of alien life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 p.m. by astrobiology, science, which is involved in the study of origin, evolution, spread and future of life in the universe, at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington.
When she invited the journalist, NASA assured that she would introduce a "disclosure that will cause a break in the search for alien life", which raised speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures living in unhospital conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and which could represent the possibility that they would once become intelligent creatures, such as human beings, if the conditions in which they live are improved.
It appears that it is a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemistic National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too jeopardy for any form of life as the lake is rich in arsenal.
Creation uses arsenal in some way to its life, and this is its ability to increase the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have an atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsen in their metabolism, it will be proven that "there is a different form of life, different from that we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real reach of discoveries at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrado, who studys the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who explore Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the perspective that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron cultivate opposition block
The reforms of the Congressional Act lead to the arrival of "bipartism".
The 60th parliamentary period has not yet been started, when the Congress founded an opposition block, led by MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech "Strana de la Democratic Revolution" - transl.), PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Strana de labour" - transl.), Convergencia of the "Partido de la Revolución Democrática"
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary session of Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo “warmly” against the reform of the Constitutional Act, as it denied them.
This reform, they repeated, begins "bapartism", because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will rule the Congress.
These four Members, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit by the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party") and Luis Cárdenas Fonspreneco's vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said that these reforms constitute institutionally a political marginality from the PRI party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and PAN.
He stated that the PAN and PRI representatives will talk to the PAN and PRI in the next few days to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be subject to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When I came here (the opposition coalitions), I look at it because we are separated from any decision, they don’t even want to consider the opinion of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, by Convergencia, stated that PRD, PT and Patrón are consistent, and therefore will form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow, to continue that the Congress, after it was monopoly, is now "dual".
The aspiration for the reform of the law is not to allow infinite bipartism to be in Congress.
This group begins with five legislators and its members now negotiate with other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, added Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by the PT explained that the Congress has now become a "coordinator" of two - in a strike on the PAN and PRI.
It was controlled by only one party before, and it was divided by two today.
Patron Montalvo asked him to respect the Member's personality so that he could be given a place at the negotiating table.
"To bring us five Members who are likely to be nine, but now see us in five, have not remained outside due to delayed agreements, each in a different group, we have agreed to find a place at the negotiation table, because the problem is that in the reform we have established and disagreed, we stand outside, and we stand out."
Another 200 thousand pesos is issued for the "supplier"
The municipality in Mazatlán will pay another cheque to the discussed owner of the company supplying electromaterials.
Another cheque for more than 200 thousand pesos was sent by the mayor Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount paid in this second semester by the owner of the company supplying electromaterial is expanding to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the view of the transparency of the municipality, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November this year, was exposed to the volume of 200,144,56 pesos and as its object was indicated "unsubstituted payment compensation".
Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for sales at high prices, another volume.
What has not been said is the total amount that the mayor still owes her, and how many cheques will be sent to the benefit of Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been purchased now, it only applies to her what we owe her as well as to other suppliers," he said in a interview.
The last checks "re-discovered" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last 16 November.
Although this undertaking has not yet been published in the Government Journal, as the law states in the case of companies verified by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent the use of their services by other administrative authorities, the cashier has ensured that it has not reused the services of the Provider of the Council.
In the previous period, after 25 July, the journal Noroeste published the checks reviewed by the Board of Directors, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year period of the mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camach Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 pesos.
It also conducted transactions with Jumapam, where it incassed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need maintenance
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the residence of Sáncheze Taboady in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the profound area of Sanchese Taboady, the tourism sector in Mazatlán requires the authorities to pay attention to the areas and places in poor condition, and not showing the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Traders in the Zona Dorada, reminded that they repeatedly asked to take the impression of the destination, the bad thing that tourists find here to replace it with new activities or routes.
He said that the poor state of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who pass through here and see irregularities, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
"Politicians do not know what it is to close a business for a day, and they do not have an idea of markets that avoid, otherwise they would not solve these matters for so long and without proper planning."
Hotel director José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the municipality.
"The council will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from repeating, it will have to take preventive maintenance, not only to fix existing defects," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve a clean residence, the municipality should change its city maintenance strategy.”
There are other places that look negligible and poor, he noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlán and El Venadito (monument, socha of fenea - transl.).
"In today's time, to come tourists, no matter only the promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city encompassing the purity of their beaches and streets where permanent maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
“It wasn’t given the necessary attention here, and these facts emphasize something that everyone knows is missing maintenance.
Speaking of a number of places to be arranged in cooperation with the mayor, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, but it will be necessary to arrange first to attract these places and to put them on the list we have to promote this destination."
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dālos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by taking the example of finding a better Sinaloy in the various challenges the state faces.
The parliamentary period is full of dignity and without agreements between the Parties and the State executive requires the entrepreneurial sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa stands out in grief and faces major problems.
The 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 members of the PAN, three of the Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and the last of the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
A list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they can implement good leadership, commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same pagean and paternalist patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dālos Zamora, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the recently elected 40 Congressional Members take great responsibility and be an example of the journey to better Sinaloo at various challenges facing.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their rights without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and become carnival leaders of governments and leaders of parliamentary groups."
He therefore said that it was necessary to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary clashes, which would move the government forward according to the order.
"We want them to carry out a decent job and be primarily committed to societies and sectors because they were the residents of Sinaloy who gave them their voice in the previous elections of trust."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will gather all forces in an effort to achieve economic growth in the country, as the current economic situation is very complex.
“The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way promote the creation of jobs.”
When it comes to tourism, he asked the new legislators to give him more weight in the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
“I learned that this is the second lowest budget ministry, which is insufficient because it is an important economic activity that brings currencies and investments that are also directly competing with agriculture.”
In addition, to grant funds to start-up tourist projects, Congress should help deliver state security and help with the alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for the Three Kings
Ladies, cars and bicycles are together with other toys on the wish list of children in the Coronad Valenzuel family.
For their parents, it will be difficult to fulfill their ideas on the coming holiday of the Three Kings, as their homes count exactly 12 people and one baron.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose the hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble residence in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, because his father has no permanent job.
"So sometimes we have it hard because our husband isn't lucky, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... in the afternoon I'm going out to sell with the 'bellbers' on the streets," said Cayetana Valenzuel, mother of children, Andrade.
Four-year-old Adelaida wants a lady or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like Barbie lady.
When it comes to the decade of José Alfred, he wants a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month brother, Jesus, Cayetana would want to wear clothes in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I would like this monster car', but I called him 'we'll see my son because it was very expensive'," Cayetan recalled.
For older children who were just in school, it would be the ideal clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, a 11-year-old, has a size of 12, a ten-year-old Isaiah, a size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel wears a size of 8.
José Juan, a 14-year-old, misses tennis, so he might have a couple of five, half, or six sizes.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can participate in the campaign "The Three Kings are looking for" and bring gifts or cash to the reception of Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
Dozens of surveys were conducted in Estria on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
14 people were arrested and faced various charges.
Surveys took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mainly in places serving for drug production.
"Around 750 potatoes of Indian cannabis, four pounds of hashish, money and equipment that served for production were fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, police spokesman in Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, of which both the boss of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to enter the court palace in Sherbrook after the arrest.
They could face accusations of producing Indian cannabis, holding it in order to trade with it, coping and stealing, among others.
These investigations were carried out after a long-term investigation, which took nearly one year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests," Ruel said.
The police operation took part in 70 regional police officers at Estrie State Police in Quebec, Sherbrooke State Police and Sherbrooke Memphrémagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The draft law of conservatives, which should regulate the problem of ships charged by illegal immigrants, will be obviously overwhelmed, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I'm very careful about the Charter."
"I'm right on the side of the party who built a yellow under your feet," said the Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by parliamentary members after a weekly du caucus meeting.
The Liberals insist that the draft law, as it is proposed, a law that would allow any person from the ship to retain up to one year, identified as a ship transporting illegal immigrants, to violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Chef of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he is heading towards the wrong goal.
“We are opposed and all opposition parties seem to be opposed, so we will see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
Olivia Chow, the NPD’s critic in the issue of immigration, rejected critics who want her side to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-democrats agree to take measures against the transporters of illegal immigrants and that’s what we consider to be the carrier of another bill, C-35,” Chow said.
"We don't support the draft law of conservatives because it bulks refugees guilty and engages children in prison for at least one year," Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition party.
“Canadians are largely telling Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that Canada takes to a man and acts with it as a pathologist.”
They expect Canada to take consistent measures, Mr Kenney responded.
The government did not declare the vote on confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
At the same time, a conservative said to the QMI agency that the government would ask for a vote to make every member who is opposed respond to his position in front of his voters.
New Unit does not mean unity
Despite the announcement, the possibility of establishing a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigative committee for this issue.
Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, seeks to keep this idea unforgettable: Quebec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation of New York in January.
Metropole has a permanent anti-corruption unit available since 1870.
The Tuesday announcement surprised one of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on October 29 last year, this measure was not discussed although Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, there was no need for public security critics, PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to evaluate this announcement as "the queen pulled out of the hat" and "the amateur solution on the knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the potential future of unity.
"It will satisfy the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the President of the CSQ, Réjeana Parenta, nothing can substitute for the establishment of an interrogation of witnesses in public convictions.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is convinced that he doesn't want to create this investigative committee, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," she explains.
“The only way to achieve the creation of an investigation committee is Jean Charest’s demise,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics at the Institute for Education of High State officials.
In order to get out of this blind street, he proposed Quebec to grant special power to the Inspector General to investigate corruption and corruption.
“We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General,” he said.
It also considers that Quebec could give the Inspector the same powers as Commissioners allowing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in Charest's letters.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This requirement would be based on the authorisation for the operation of Marteau (Kladivo), which informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the judiciary in this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some amendments related to this letter.
Although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested during the Spring 2001 operation, which affected a group of bikers.
Ottawa then allowed her to make changes to the Law on gangstership.
Rivers under strict surveillance.
Several water flows have been strictly controlled due to severe precipitations that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was an earthquake.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
This evening there was another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The roads are broken.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions have raged severe precipitations, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters.
More than 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
Cuts in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley have been most affected.
There could be a total of 100 millimeters.
If we count these rainfalls with the snow accumulated in some sectors, we can worry about flooding in some water flows.
Quebec’s rescue service announced on Wednesday night warning of the danger of floods for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The Greeks in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the forest of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become subject to flood preparedness and continuous control.
In the area of Lanaudière, some lakes were displaced, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a preliminary bridge was fired as a result of strong rainfall.
Two residents had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outaouais, some lakes from the shore have led to the closing of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and monitors the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
Quebec Flood Forecast Center issued on Wednesday warning against strong floods for several rivers, particularly Maskinong, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially congratulated
Quebec’s radio moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered partially infrequently before the Canadian Radio and TV Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as due to gross expression during broadcasting.
The Radio and TV Broadcasting Council judges that Mr. Dupont and his group of CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their opinions, but some statements contained "incorrect information on social aid and inappropriate negative relief of Haitians, which does not correspond to the broadcasting of the day".
The Council also concluded that the self-suicide discussions, including broadcasting the names of both people who have taken their lives, have not violated the rules for broadcasting.
The Radio and TV Broadcasting Council received several complaints regarding comments made during broadcasting, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after the complaint from the Common Front of the beneficiaries of social support in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts listed in the broadcast were inaccuracies.
The moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
With regard to suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed suicide was a gesture of despair.
The majority of the Commission members concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission believes that the controversial episodes of the "Dupont field reports" have touched the delicate theme in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no exit against him.
The last dispute concerns the statement followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort joined a media shooting that caused many reactions.
The mediator CHOI stated that he did not send any gift to help the Haitians because we can’t be sure that the necessary money would actually be received.
The Commission believes that these comments were not unauthorized, but that their cumulative effect creates an inadequately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already made my three-day delay of that thing."
"My record has been intact for a year and a half," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use hard expressions in broadcasting.
Anyway, CHOI-FM radio broadcasting worked "over its duties".
For the station, which will, inter alia, have to notify this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
You're the King of Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, originating in Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special time.
The athlete, who comes out in the "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in the kickbox and the Thai box, enters the tatami and rings around the world and searches for new challenges.
"I started with fighting arts such as kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who now lives in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals."
"In my case, I am looking for games so slightly everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person who works as a protector and assistant for UPS has just added bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I played the kickbox full contact and the Thai box, he added."
"I'm currently preparing to China for the World Cup in the Dream Shoo."
“The competitors were invited to end with the first four at the last world championship in each category.”
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
In 2005, I finished eight in Vietnam.
"In 2007, I ended in the fifth morning tournament in China, while in 2009, in Toronto, I ended in the third," he added.
“It’s interesting that I’ve made some progress in every competition.”
“I’m going to be the first year or the first year!”
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a discipline originating in China where the hits of foot and foot are allowed, as well as throwing on the ground.
The games are traditionally played on the board and rarely in the ring.
The most well-known boxer of this form of battle is the American Vietnamese Cung Le, well-known in the world of combat art.
No matter what Nacer Zemmal has to hold only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the Super Bowl "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's so slightly equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the final.
"Whoever defeated me was a real professional, analyzed."
"They are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the final of their categories."
"The winners of each category are then defeated so that one champion, King kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public competitions
Hydro-Québec agreed on a mutual agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this lavish more than 100 contracts, it is just a consortium created by BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most important contract, a contract to manage the entire project in total $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Energie gérance, was endorsed in 2004 in conjunction with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust its responsibility to the private sector for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energy gérance" won a lucratic contract without any announcement of the public competition.
For the Quebec party, a complaint to a company consortium poses a serious ethical problem that risks exclusion of competition and causes price rise.
“It’s a new way to implement columns and eliminate competition.”
"This means that people, no longer making side agreements secretly, are doing them openly today," PQ Member Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
Something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said he was harshly carrying how public interest could be sold in this way.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, said in the afternoon, rejecting the collapse contract.
"I have my own journey," she claimed and claimed that the PQ was "unexpected" and "was lost accuracy."
She said "that would be the smallest" that PQ would apologize.
A recipe for the creation of a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually an alliance, a time-limited, allowing two or more companies to gather their mutual expertise so that they can respond to the challenge of submitting tenders to a comprehensive project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of work.
The building is already running and must be deployed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition; it was a trade.
It is also necessary to admit that the formula of the consortium is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the formula of the consortium in engineering advisory is subject to government investigations.
If we fly over a business record of Quebec companies at the speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortiums, some of which appear to be created next.
This Dessau company operates in partnership with most of its main competitors; we name CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that is Dessau.
As regards the Energie gérance consortium, Normandeau emphasized in particular the fact that "la Baie James' territory is a typical special dynamic of labour forces and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The chief project patron of Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), made an explanation that forced us to overcome the fact that the project management contract was concluded after a mutual agreement.
“If you’re going to a public competition and if there’s few competitors, your offered prizes can be higher.”
“You have two options to choose: that’s to collect people who figure in the same contract as competitors, and that’s to say, ‘Let’s conclude an agreement satisfying and with a good price.’”
“But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the competence of people,” Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts for over $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Devoir accounted for 109 engineering advisory contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, particularly with laboratories conducting soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin collected 22 contracts, of which Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without participating in "Energy Management".
All contracts have been concluded.
A total of $449,783,344, including a contract with Energie gérance at $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal Party of Quebec".
Normandeau issued a report that PQ is also associated with companies that "financing it" before she stated that it was rather her managers.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not stimulate confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in "extraordinary" brands and environmental certificates, in order to control their choice of products.
The worst is that even if we buy ourselves in the media space that urges us and encourages us to consume more socially responsible, this media space calls for the lack of credible information, the failure of the obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, Barometer pointed out in the first article of the responsible consumer.
Although the consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, the inhabitants of Quebec, who are trying to sell them, do not believe them too much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t trust the promises of companies about the environment simply because the green advertising of companies is a measuring tool developed by the University’s responsible Consumer Observatory at Sherbrooke.
Other findings: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates applied to the so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are marked as environmentally responsible, Barometer states.
In the same way, political debate on this subject is taken as serious by only 14.6% of Quebec people.
However, the information on responsible consumption appears to be the first to stimulate this consumer site that is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and doubtful nature of information would relieve the excitement of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer at a higher price of these products.
Otherwise, one-third of the people of Quebec are unreliable with respect to the information provided about the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them go through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and particularly change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
All 61% of them preferred shopping from traders from their neighborhood and gave preference to buying food grown in their region, Barometer says.
More "green" and responsible - accountable consumption index has reached 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québeku is delighted to be presented as the king of recycling, striving for the least environmental impact possible by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and ecological consciousness apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebec people said they were using public transport or recommend using a car to drive at least two people, in the interests of nature.
The ride and bike also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive conduct survey that used this climbing.
State loan for the sale of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only to the amount of the loan.
The Developper company Angus et le Parallèle, who sought a $7 million gift from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinematographic complex at the Saint-Laurent bulwar and who demonstrated his mission as a lover of film art, did not get what she requested.
The Government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift proposed by the government of Quebec a loan, the amount of which would still be lower, was some of the original expectations, which could build the basis for a viable solution in favourable conditions and resources originating from the state.
The first action plan and demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebeca last spring, but requests for reduction have already been revised.
The proposal and action plan was sent by St-Pierre Minister President of the Society for Cultural Business Development (SODEC), François Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final message was sent ten days ago.
But the anti-government proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have the time to answer until 31 December.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must be really rejected.
Let’s remember that the Association of Owners of Cinema and Cinema Centers in Quebec was opposed to the state’s direct investment in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, suppressing that the Minister of Culture does not have to finance a real estate project if it did not do so for other cinemas.
But, on the contrary, a number of participants in the debate were demanding substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, entered his cinema in the course of ten years after financing the building of a complex, which could be the reason for change by the State Financial Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris managed to acquire a permanent client.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in its head, runs a campaign to release funds into the private sector, in the belief that it holds $700,000 to suppress the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to re-open all three halls on February 27 next year and showcase the most beautiful film of Xaviera Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember Le Devoir, and so he is ignored, thinking with his group about suggestions for reduction that are committed to him.
Increased tires in Canada as a whole...
The new U.S. diplomatic sources listed through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be a complex of Canadian minority against Americans, but reflect their feelings of superiority towards Canada last named.
The U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter is in the heart of Canadian-American relations when they are going to vote, and believe that the visit to President Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
Four new reports between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday on public disclosure, also provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The Communication dated 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, specifies in detail what point the United States is not part of the betting discussed by political leaders.
To the great admiration of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides a few explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian complex of minority, nearly solid, reminds potential political leaders to talk about internal bets, rather than to realize that these elections are also related to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign).
“The United States is therefore, in these elections, an unprecedented elephant: everywhere, but potentially too threatening to talk about them.”
The Ambassador means this “delicious silence” that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or even better the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to elections."
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be read in the report sent by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa à Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your way will help ensure the government's conservation of trust in the early February with regard to the federal budget to which Canada publicly recognizes its first deficit in more than ten years due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan," Breese said.
Never mentions that the government had to resign the parliamentary session so that it could not be defeated by coalitions and that the opposition parties are conditioned on their survival as the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington’s increasingly negative image, which throws drama series broadcast to the CBC in the United States.
The Ambassador is worried about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe not too confidential links to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnapping for the purpose of the CIA's violent hearings.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe is ready to accept some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but based on the principle of "a case approach".
In the conclusion of the meeting, he wrote here, "he sent some paper concerning Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, the state secretary."
"The secrets accepted by reviewing the folder."
Finally, let’s note that the people concerned with WikiLeaks are going to die.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said in the CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "devastated".
This was announced and Mike Huckabee heard about it in the United States.
World Lighting Restoration Plan
The UN proposed in Cancún yesterday a plan to renew domestic lighting, trade lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries in order to achieve greenhouse gas limits (GES), which corresponds to nearly one-third of the further limits that the planet’s climate needs to be stabilized from now to 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major specific projects that the United Nations wants to implement in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficultly implementable commitments to reduce on the side of industrialised countries.
According to the proposed plan yesterday, if burned lights, which monopolize further 50 to 70% of the market, replace with fluocompact lights or, even better, with electroluminiscent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), significant amounts of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) would be given to GES emissions from planets.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of emissions from the car park across the planet.
Last year, in Copenhagen, large countries with a significant share of emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have been involved in voluntary reduction plans that should allow global GES emissions to decrease from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But there will be more than 5 Gt to be removed from this balance in order to achieve climate warming stabilization at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020, so that it can be excluded that it will not be out of control.
In burned lights, 95% of energy spreads in the form of heat and residue, i.e. 5% is the product of light.
With fluocompact lamps, energy consumption decreases by 75%, and with new DEL lamps, we reduce this consumption again twice.
The fluocompact lamps hold an average of 6000 to 10000 hours.
The new DEL lamps, which introduced this week to the production of Philips - this company allegedly participated in the United Nations study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the burning lamp, giving us an idea of the possible savings with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lamps can also work with reostatic and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any rupture.
Several experts have expressed reserves for fluocomputing lamps because they contain rust and need to be classified as dangerous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries,but producers would create collections.
However, as the report indicates, the main source of rtuth emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact lamp, but rather thermal coal plants that release many rtuths needed to produce electricity frozen in burned lamps.
Only in the U.S. these centres offer a range of 25,000 tons of roast per year.
The report also specifies the benefits that each country would benefit from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, the construction of which would cost 2.5 billion.
The Elephant coast is patiently expecting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections on the Elephant Coast after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for an independent election committee to complete its work and immediately announce preliminary results," the spokesman of the United Nations said.
"It asks all parties to the Coast of Elephants and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are notified."
Despite the pressures developed by some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the latest date – Wednesday midnight – without publishing the results, three days after Sunday scroll.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, CEI’s president on television confirmed that the Commission “progresses at work” to announce results.
On Wednesday, challenges worldwide have been multiplied to make the CEI finally declare the name of the winner of the second wheel, between departing Laurent Gbagbo and Alassam Ouattar's opposition member.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for "fraud" votes in the north, managed by former rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failure of the state shift in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Elephant Coast Presidency Election Campaign, confirmed that the dropping of voters practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country dismissed the president's supporters from the Elephant Coast to go to the election.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council had taken into account the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country's Supreme Court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political allied of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who demented any connection with former rebels, condemned the resignation in the announcement of results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect them, but did not go so far that he would demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of results because he knows that he suffered loss and that complaining to the Constitutional Council after defending the election commission would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections held on Sunday was considered the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two-half years ago.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political fraction of the Elephant Coast that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round, October 31, as a winner of 38% votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolitan France (9.7% including offshore areas), according to the provisional data on the correction of seasonal deviations (CVS), published by the INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed people was 2,631 million in the city.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in metropolis and 9.7% including offshore areas.
The unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points in one year.
In a broader picture, 3.4 million people in the metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, whether they are available in two weeks to work, and whether they are looking for work or not.
The situation of current youth on the labour market has still emerged with a new increase in unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including offshore areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 unemployed youth were aged between 15 and 24.
As for seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), 482,000 people from 50 years old and 6.6% including offshore areas.
Only the 25-49-year-olds saw unemployment benefits at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Insee has no longer disclosed the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following the question of its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, is continuing to develop monthly statistics and announced on Tuesday the rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it was 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste processing companies and brother of the Board of Directors of Bouches-du-Rhône, was accused and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the case of public procurement investigations, allegedly allegedly acquired.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of abuse of corporate assets, abuse of public funds and public assets, secrecy, charges, acceptance of charges in order to influence the office and hold the shooting, the lawyer said.
"Alexander Guérini is fighting and is trying to explain to the judge all the questions he intends to ask, not any overlook."
"It's easy to trace him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," his attorney Florence Rault told AFP, ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini stated through his lawyers that he sent the judges before his hearing a short message to explain everything.
One of his neighbours, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his attorney, Luciena Simona, his client never did anything but ensured the functioning of the goods he had to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew anything like that, said Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of Services of the Aubagne Aglomeration, was charged on Wednesday for abuse of public funds and complot, and left free,under judicial supervision, to face the protagonists of the whole affair.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that are affected by him."
"The investigative judge is watching and leaving him free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Other four persons were charged and released on Tuesday night, with the fact that they were under judicial supervision for two of them, state government official Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General for the Elegancy of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is accused of taking charges to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officers from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one for "discrimination and abuse of society's assets", the other for "complot in abuse of public resources".
Finally, business partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of “secreting the abuse of the company’s property.”
Among the persons confronted with Mr. Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who has recently been accused of a concurrent case of fraudulent public procurement concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to get money from extensive gangstership.
The investigation was conducted within several open court investigations against X in April 2009 after the acceptance of anonymous letters relating to alleged fraud in the conclusion of public procurement, particularly in the case of waste.
From a source of close investigation, research focuses particularly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a waste in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from Marseille City Community (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: The Elysean Palace has overcome Syria's mediation
Within more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", unified opinions in France, led diplomacy to fighting and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All of this is carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
American documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, as he went so far that he gave them advice to manage such cases in Iran (a small group of travellers).
They show how the leading French leaders attempted to convince Washington that the release of young French was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavanda, an Iranian prisoner in France, and an American justice sought for submarine trade in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they undermine the way the French presidency attempted to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything for that.
The diplomatic telegram written in Paris on August 12, 2009 has the title: "Iran: French comments on how to resolve the case of rape".
The Elysean Palace’s strategic advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the director Quai d’Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of the American Allegrone Diplomacy.
It is explained by the French method.
They recommend that the Americans do as much so that they are transported back to their own country by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "continue to express in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "instant liberation".
It is necessary to bring a hateful Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it more, the more they ask you to stop.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "no silence will solve anything," Iranians are "masters of avoiding maneuvers".
Mr. Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is "Iran's family tactic: taking arms for the purposes of "political disguise".
The release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, on the day the French Embassy will provide her with an asylum) "is required to pay high financial amounts to the Iranians" (about €2300,000).
And he will announce that the Elysees Palace anticipates the cases of relief, a phenomenon that "will be strengthened."
“In the future, Iranians could arrest some 1,800 French living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, which the United States declares was thrown out for illegal trade in electronic materials sensitive to Iran, is released to freedom in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as many observers, asks about this anxiety.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian network to obtain material for the nuclear program, the release of Majida Khakavanda is a bad news.
Did France join the contract?
The Liberation of Iran for the Liberation of Young French?
In a further interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The palace of Elysee was not only "astonished by this judge's decision," but was also looking for an opportunity to fight against it.
“The conversations between the Presidential Office and the Minister of Justice took place” (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the judgment of the court,” he said.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" supervision of the French reporting service.
The Elysean Palace’s adviser will draw the phone number, suspend the phone headphone and then inform the US diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of the imprisonment of Klotilda Reiss in Iran, the Elysee Palace is developing efforts, negotiating through communication and organized "unites" in the media to convince that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "significant" and "influence" role as a mediator.
U.S. observes this activity not without irony and finds that manipulation bears its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
The telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French officials.
On what such a “gratitude” is based, expressed to Mr. Assado, the Embassy in Paris asks.
"And despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a shameful idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then addresses the reasons for the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
“Intensive communication is aimed at validating the policy of President Sarkozy’s opening to Syria,” he said.
Politics implemented in 2008 “was observed by many critical votes in France and abroad and marked as premature and unworthy.”
"How to overcome the Syrian role," Paris attempts to "demonstrate Syria's praises that he can earn when he plays a constructive role in the area."
It also aims to “seize the harshness between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Obviously, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is."
"We thanked them yet."
“This should at least bring about confusion and unclearness between Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it in the Elysee Palace.
In the communication, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our country.”
End of online games at midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government adopts a law called "Pecivalsky", which will prohibit teens from playing online games at midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight to persons under 16 years of age, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Families said.
“Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, chief agent of the ministry, said.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law.
The Government also assumes that it requires companies to restrict the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents are asking for that, by the responsible employee.
It also provides free programs for those who ask for it, allowing you to limit the time spent on the internet.
South Korea is one of the most "posted" countries and daily prints regularly bring different facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an uncontroversial champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
Full concern for corruption is established by the Fifa Executive Committee on Thursday of the host country's World Cup in 2018 and 2022, a highly politically motivated choice where the fight for influence and lobbying risks to pre-evaluate technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe , a traditional base of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, while the International Federation hopes that it will be able to gain a new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its prime ministers on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its invasion into the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities involved in delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, heads of government actors in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the entire economic and political world.
The negotiations in the zakulis are at the risk that they will take up to the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment reports, English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) documentation contains the best arguments as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for 22 members of the Executive Committee in an hour to vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelation, led to the suspension of two members of the CE/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam) may have thus destroyed the chances of his country, the copain, who had yet hosted the world championship only once a year.
The BBC set this on Monday, when she sent a document "which was enrolled on a spindle" by three influential CE members (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make the Fifa unsatisfied and bring the British leader to the distress with David Cameron in the first place.
The president hopes that he will be able to repeat the task that his predecessor succeeded as Tony Blair, who was able to win for the 2012 Olympics in London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to provide England with a new shine in its name to the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the two of Spain-Portugal lack trumps of already prepared stadiums, its celebration (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Proceedings against English and doubts about the eligible payment of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was outsider despite the missiles in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the President of the Government, Vladimir Poutin, decided that the championship would not move to Zurich and publicly declare "another competition in voting preparation", in speeches which only had little to blame the English press against the members of the European Commission.
"We're going to bloom after them, we're going to try to compromise them," Poutin said.
By 2022, it appears to be the logical favorite of the United States with its significant 1994 experience.
The world’s highest economic performance, headquarters of Fifa’s main sponsors, appears to have a large scale in front of Japan and South Korea, which separately developed a beautiful project.
But these candidates appear to be premature for both countries that together conducted a "test" in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 world championship of China, who wishes the Fifa, made Asian chances inaccessible by 2022.
With Katara, who pulled large eso out of the army in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand to new landscapes, but these two countries represent more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be punished for the chat fees paid by European countries, which constitute a hip power for FIFA.
Second mandate: clearance (security)
De Gaulle really wasn't.
Mitterrand woke up his feelings.
Values Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not even in the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
The mandate of the Elisha Palace calls someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But obviously, it is not in good agreement with the share of secrets associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it is necessary to do as if doubts continue.
In one and in the other sense.
In 2006, unwilling to believe this, Jacques Chirac’s friends had the right to not exclude the third mandate.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said he would "decide sometime in autumn 2011".
As he recalled before UMP parliamentarians on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the perspective of "two mandate" was a little warm.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
He wasn't far from that.
The President only recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year periods of functioning to two.
It was just a statement, not a notification.
It’s not the first time it reminds me of such a humorous tone of presidential elections.
“In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years before me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebel in May 2010: “Don’t think I’m thinking about the next stage.”
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the previous day; he will not make him a candidate or less.
If they make comments, that's due to the two truths.
Accelerate the journey to the candidate to the PS, on the one side.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèna Royale, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convince him.
This is because his 2012 nomination is evident that many in the PS want to arrange in the fighting compositions rather early than planned.
Bad survey on the other side.
First, right voters would prefer François Fillon's candidate before Nicolas Sarkozy's candidate (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidates and do not discuss this with UMP," the people from the nearest area of the government responded instantly and carefully.
"If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," said Alain Juppé, who is obviously balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its procurement of state securities.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year had the opportunity to clarify the conditions for exit from the crisis or, at least, a notice of the suspension of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be terminated by the end of this year.
The European Crisis is committed, and the Securities Issuing Institute will undoubtedly not be able to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration today’s situation already stressed on European securities markets.
In that case, the political price would be higher.
At the press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the hold’s active role played by the Central European Bank in the interests of the crisis of European countries’ demands.
She didn’t want to say if she thinks that the bank could do more, for example by increasing her program of purchases of supervisory bonds.
"I express my opinion for my European partners..."
In the evening before, in Brussels, in his interrogation by the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the Central Bank of Europe, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied with the fact that the programme of the purchase of state titles in the secondary market, as we "see" the secondary market, "as the secondary market".
The only certainty: the Central European Bank will protect its basic unchanged interest rate to 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the cash purchases made by the Central European Bank doubled to nearly 1.35 billion euros in the last week.
And thanks to the incomprehension of the market contracts, Irish and Portuguese bonds made new purchases yesterday.
The Eurosystem’s total central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt between market income anticipation for continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Economists do not expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have disappeared from the European Central Bank’s arsenal, the latter appointed bank shall access the unlimited provision of liquid funds under large conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine she'd change her program in a significant way."
“If not, it would take the risk of creating a short-term new voltage,” said Michael Schubert, an economist of Commerzbank.
"Progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions on the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds to revive the mild market," says Norbert Bräms.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to the markets with overwhelmed debt in the euro area, there is nothing more to choose than to maintain their presence on the market.
"It needs to replace the deficit of investors on the market at any cost and act in such a way to prevent the inflation of the paid performances of the countries that are among the most severe," the major bond manager said yesterday.
Because if interest rates would drop, States would be more troubled to reduce their debt than to stabilize it.
It is the saving of the euro for this price.
The government of Berlusconi's back in Italy
After the beginning of the week for Italy, a slightly disturbed situation, yesterday with the back flow of bond interest for 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy of the Regions, they said they heard Giulia Tremonti of qualifying the situation as "unresolved" and expecting a "unpredictable" weekend, which then dementialed the participants.
In any case, the deviation from long German interest on Tuesday reached a record of 210 basic points, and the price of CDS was up to 263 points, causing certain disruptions in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the deviation with German interest rates was more than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared himself "tough busy" with the "business of markets" and a possible infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Obviously and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal input, which goes hand in hand and exposes it to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecast for Brussels was a cold shower for the government.
The Italian growth is expected from now on to 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will represent another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (versus 3.9% of the expected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
From there, the reputation of a new summary of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after holidays, is EUR 7 billion.
"When necessary, new strict measures will be taken," Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
For the present time, Italy is supporting international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have repeated it for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, Italian member of the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because through its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilize Italy is less than the efforts required by other countries,” says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There is still a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal for the disrespect of the House of Parliament and then will be able to begin elections that will be counted on at the end of March.
This would start a period, which is unsuitable for decision-making in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking of strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde once again stressed at the Paris press conference: "I think Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday and night, they are obviously very solidarous, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is a relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion regarding interest on European national bonds brought water to millions of governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can’t talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's notation agency announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt record, targets which are most focused on various speculations.
“Because in May it is insufficiently transparent and obvious policy, which is mainly based on banking systems,” economist Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time runs slower than market time.”
With the knowledge of this interrupted context and the dangers that it hides, European countries intensify discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers, the most concerned with the problem, and in a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
With regard to the Eurogroup meetings and the Ecofin Group since the beginning of next week.
The European Central Bank meeting is held today.
The destiny of non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
As regards the European Finance Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, announced a trip to Singapore through Asia on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of this journey is not to increase funds, it will prepare soil security to achieve this goal.
The first ESF securities is expected for the next month.
The U.S. official said yesterday to Reuters that the United States would support potential increases in mobilised funds by additional direct involvement in the IMF.
The countries, which are primarily Portugal and Spain, are preparing for the adoption of structural reforms, especially when it comes to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms associated with strict measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid have not been used by Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid requesting international assistance at any cost even before they apply their own budget corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to gain a lasting trust again.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to accelerate the normalization process of markets with over-the-counter bonds.
On November 24, Axel Weber, on his journey to Paris, thought if it would not be €750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the Union would not hesitate to rebuild the stock of securities.
The Barclays Capital economist, who is an actor of the entire first European supervisory bond trading plan, judges that the surplus of about €100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct granting financial liquidity.
The fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is subsidised to this day by EUR 60 billion.
The Council has all the chances to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have worsened.
Snow and waterfalls: 24 countries have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations are still causing difficulties in transport, especially on roads of other classes in Britain, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties have an emergency from now on because of the risk of snow and injury.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined the 20 districts already declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the evening.
According to Weather France, significant snowfalls cause problems in the northern la Gironde and forest Charentes and weakly snow in Ile-de-France.
The snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places to 5 in the Paris region.
Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow springs are large enough to cause traffic difficulties and distort some economic activities, Meteo France predicts.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some districts prohibited transit of heavy freight - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The road traffic of the second-class roads in Britain is very difficult, and the police recommend that you go out with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and some trucks have been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned on Thursday in Picardia.
On Wednesday evening no special measures to restrict freight transport are envisaged.
The office calls on all drivers to be careful as much as possible on roads and to adapt the driving nature of the car.
The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on Paris Roissy Airport and 10% on Orly due to expected snowfalls on Thursday.
DGAC recommends to passengers using air transport services to connect with its company.
In the UK, Gatwick airport is closed to the south of London and Edinburgh, Scotland.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport to Ile-de-France in full-flow, billions have rain.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminded of 23 billion underground Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to launch this building, the State announced a grant of €4 billion.
Purely theoretically, it is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its dual-source funding for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first add-ons.
The 2010 Financial Rectification Act, which is examined by the Financial Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to ensure these funds.
There are two: creating a special tax on equipment and increase tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, let’s read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "in the benefit of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is said: “The extraction of this interest rate is €117 million per year.”
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists, "to be modernized to increase the revenue obtained from it and to affect this increase to Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Overhead.
This is not counted in the text.
We've got up to 4 billion.
“It is clear that these financial resources are connected to €4 billion from capital grants that will be mobilised by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” we read in a statement.
In SGP, this system doesn’t seem shocking to us.
“From the moment we created income (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the study for three years and then play up to 4 billion, explains here.”
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP believes that 4 billion will be assigned to the 2014 budget in 2013.
This mechanism, in which four billions of promises belong yet to missing subscribers, risks a slightly disruptive parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Fateful hackers and motivating fans
WikiLeaks is of double importance.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal, a scandal that appears to be a scandal, only faces the face of coverage that governs relations between states, citizens and press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at international level, and prefers the future of controlled regressions.
But let's do the order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every document made up of a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of a press release.
"Excellent revelation" by Americans about Berlusconi's sexual life reports them what everyone has read in any newspapers for months (all except these two Berlusconi's own), and the Cadhafi's caricature profile has long been the theme for Cabaret artists for scanner.
The rule, according to which secret documents should consist only of reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to the library dedicated to esoterical literature, you will see that every work repeats (from Graalu, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, Templars or Journals) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (not even knowing where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to occult believe only what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dana Brown's success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informator is lined, and lined (or a limited spirit) chief of secret services (and if not, it could, as I know, be a editor in the newspapers Libération), who considers it true only what he admits himself.
High-secret information about Berlusconi, sent by the US Embassy to the state resort, was the same that Newsweek published a week earlier.
So why have so many stories been made around the revelation of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, and that the embassy, at least from the end of World War II, and from the time the heads of state could call or fly on a plane for a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation of a transformer
Any stranger watching films about investigations knows very well that only from oversight it appears to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is repeated in public is deprived of the obligation of coverage and throws the bad light into American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can get the most secret information the most powerful country in the world is a hard strike, not a negligible, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "madefactors".
But let's go from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once, in Orwell’s time, it was possible to capture all the power, like a Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvel’s prophecy has been proven since then, thanks to the possibility of controlling every movement through the phone, every transaction, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, has become a totally victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it’s going now, that even “tombs” with the most secret information of power cannot resist any hacker’s intervention, the control message stops being one-way and becomes a circle.
The power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as a rival of a citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that the true secret is an incomprehensible secret (and the incomprehensible secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a truly incomprehensible secret, because it is extracted from the secrets of the public life, but it was like the revelation of the Wikilyard.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but made something big to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wound be so significant?
It is obvious that in the future states will not be able to send sensitive information online - it would be similar to its publication on a post on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies it is unnecessary to hope that it can be kept in secret a message on the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled with an airplane and joined some of his colleagues.
How can private and sensitive news be kept in the future?
Well, I know that for this moment, the prediction belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government agents who are carrying discreetly fulfillment of formality on uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that know memory or rather hide rare information in the support of shoes.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-closed shells: Overall, the Watergate spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph was a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a cable-based telegraph.
Videocases (analogs) allowed lovers to film movies step by step, move it forward and back and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to jump through chapters, i.e. after macroports.
We will travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while we will travel by plane and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not exceptional that policy and communications techniques return to cars with horses.
Last note.
Once the press tried to understand what happened in the secret of the embassy.
Now they are the embassy who seek confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to fulfil the promises of fast-blocked financing (speaking fast-start or early-start financing) implemented by developed countries.
And large French hacks were revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, advanced countries have committed to grant $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1.26 billion euros (this is 420 million euros per year).
At the start of the COP16, the EU has drawn a large eso to convince its partners about the reality of their commitment to fast start financing: a report clarifying the action of their Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, a distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued at their real value: advanced countries and civil society would like them to be equal to all advanced countries and civil society to equal accuracy.
The EU announced that it released €2.2 billion in 2010, leading it to the right path to fulfil its 7.2 billion promise in 2012.
But if we focus on the details, we will find that things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Copenhagen Agreement to ensure that increased burden is implemented without harm to the Public Development Aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement in what means "new and additional".
While the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, considered a 2009 reference: International financing has been maintained and adds 150 million more to it for three years of fast start financing title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and complementary".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of Public Aid for Development of Aid publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of support for France to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even reduce), it must comply with its commitment to financing "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and each chooses its own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, think that a borrowed €1 is equal to a donated €1.
Obviously, it is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for certain investments that are profitable (frequently related to emission reduction projects consisting of more efficient technologies), it is rich to present one euro that we get as an equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not understand it as a coin for the title of the country of our liabilities.
However, France can only give the following grounds: it "contains" its commitment of 420 million euros, making 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify it yourself.
It is the only Union country that uses the loan to this extent.
Germany demanded 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (including others) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the full majority of the European Union gives €1 in the context of fulfillment of its promise, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
Beautiful cockroaches!
To summarize, in its financing of "fast start" France operates with a double headquarters: on the one hand with the development of a share in time and on the other hand with real financial burden.
Although it only issued 36.1 million euros, it is able to convince it to issue 420 million euros of "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it appears to be Bercy who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (because Member States would continue to grant when only to borrow?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question, relatively short term, in relation to the series of climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of sand in a huge machine like UNFCCC.
Hopefully that's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to collect knowledge from this first year of early financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of conducting accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its obligations and dignity and justice with respect to other EU countries.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term funding deposits (other key chapter currently discussed): we will not avoid the question of "supplency" or how loans are incurred.
France should change its position to become as advanced in these deposits as with others.
Therefore, hopes are all included in the new Environment Ministry, Mrs. Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast startup and its vision of “suppleability” and the use of loans could lead to an increase in international confidence needed to be put forward in discussions.
A warning about pesticides that children will see.
A 10-year-old child will see 81 different chemicals on one day, according to a study published on Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Movement for Rights and the preservation of future generations).
Association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value given the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light food as a light meal for one child for about ten years in the supermarkets.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruits and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as sugars, were analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the table is devastating: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are among carcinogenous, possible or likely, and five are among clear carcinogenous substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as a interfering centre for internally mixed throats (PE), according to studies for several institutions.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each individually accepted chemical are not exceeded, we are well aware in our research that the reality in the exposure to consumers to contaminant substances is possibly carcinogenous, and/or PE is infectious,” the association says.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogenics, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, introduced in studies as a small pot, contains traces of six chemicals, including a prohibited fungicide in France.
The same applies to green Kenya faucets included in lunch, where the study found traces of strong insecticides forbidden in the EU.
In addition, mild meat beefs, tunics in potatoes, and even foams and mushrooms were sprayed pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the analysis, the presence of nitrogens and chloroform was revealed.
The steak from the loss to dinner was "the richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered and even the analysis of the plastic container used to heat food in the microwave furnace was inevitable.
The final risk for consumers of this "cocktail contaminants" is likely to be underestimated," according to the study.
Environmental Europe-Green Society (EE-LV) proposed to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "growing of civilian diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) examined the state of the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
