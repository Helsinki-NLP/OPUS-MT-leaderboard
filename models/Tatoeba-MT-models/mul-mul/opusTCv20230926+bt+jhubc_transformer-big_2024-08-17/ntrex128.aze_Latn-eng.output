Members of the Uels House are worried about being "replaced in the game"
Some Members are concerned about the proposal that requires a change in their names to the Uels Parliamentary Members (UPU).
This issue has emerged after a plan to change the name of the House of Representatives as Uels Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are concerned that they will be able to do so.
One of the members of the Workers' Party in the House noted that according to his party, it is like "Twp and Pwp."
Let's note that for readers who aren't from Uels, it's "Twp" in Uels, but "Pwp" means a thing.
Members of the Pleyd Party are not satisfied with this situation as a whole and have continued their proposals.
Uels' representative of the Defence Party said that his party's name change was normal enough, but it should be noted that this is a short verbal transfer on behalf of the Uels Parliament Member.
In this context, the word "w" in the word "Welsh" is similar to the word "u" in the English language Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is now preparing the draft law for the name of the Members of the Assembly, said that the last decision on the name to be given to the Members of the Assembly, of course, will also be of interest to them.
The Uels Government has given its power to change its name to the Uels Assembly in 2017.
In June, the Commission's House of Representatives published the results of the public consultation to appoint Uels Parliament and received extensive support by the mass change of the name.
The Uels parliamentary members (WMP) of the Commission, on behalf of the Members of the House, have been addressed, but have received the most support in public consultations with the MWP (Uels parliamentary members).
Members of the House also continue to offer open-end alternative choices, but they will prepare and submit a bill of law on changes within a few weeks to participate in the struggle.
Changes to the draft law relating to the council's work press will also be included, including rules relating to the disqualification of members of the council and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the last decision on the name change during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonians are holding a referendum on the change of the country's name
Elections will participate in a vote on the change of the country's name to the "Republic of Macedonia."
People's voting aims to resolve the struggle with Greece, a neighbor named Macedonia for decades.
For a long time, the name of the Northern Neighbor is the name of the country's residence and has repeatedly insisted that it is a member of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, said he wouldn't go to the elections.
But Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, including the referendum, has said that the change in name needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The calls of St. Martin's Church live a period of destruction as in the churches during the Battle of Harlem
"The elderly men I've been talking about were saying there is a bar and a church in every corner of the past," said Adams.
“There is no one today.”
He pointed out that it was a fact that there was no bars.
"Today people are socializing in a different direction," he said.
"There's no bars that people can't walk around around their homes."
When he comes to churches, he is worried that the revenue from the sale of assets will not be long as the leaders expected, and he said, "and they will have to return to the place they started before."
In addition, he noted that the churches could be replaced by buildings that were composed of property buildings, with people filled with people who would not destroy the temples around them.
"The vast majority of people who have houses in these buildings will be a network man, and therefore will accelerate the day of connecting churches together, because most people who are moving to these buildings are likely to be members of these churches," he said.
The two churches in Harlem were built by the Black Metropolis in 1870, and ten years after the Church of St. Martin.
In the 1930s, the Socialist Methodist Society moved.
The people of the Black Society who prayed nearly were called the church.
St. Martin's Church is conducted by the leaders of the 125th Street boycott group, considered to be the main streets in Harlem for the market for the work of blackmen or the deportation of blackmen, by the Con Hovard Conson's leadership of blackmen.
The fire that occurred in the building in 1939 hit him last severely, but they built plans to rebuild the building, they used the carriage.
The translator David Conson, the son of the father and the consort Conson, called his charion with a great pride in the Church of St. Martin, called "the call of the poor."
The expert who wrote the carriage in Jop gave him other names: "Madeware" and "unchangeable history music instrument."
Tiffani Nc, a member of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was a cartoon, first-time named by Dionisio A. Lind, black skin in the world in Riverside (Riversayd) Church 18 years ago.
Merivezer said that St. Martin wouldn't replace him.
In the last few months, every tool expressed in St. Martin reflects the confusion of architects and subscribers, some of whom were brought by church leaders who were not related to this profession, while others were brought by bishops.
The management body of prizod men, organized from non-professionals, reported their concerns to the bishop in July. Even though they did not participate in the work of the architects and subordinates sent to the bishop, they were also "referred to the management body of expenditure associated with it."
Some people were complaining that there was no transparency in the Bishop.
Injured 13-year-old boys who were injured in California.
Officials reported that a 13-year-old boy who had been injured in California was attacked by a 13-year-old boy who had been injured in California on Saturday's opening of the season.
The event occurred just before 7 a.m. in the morning around the Bekon Square.
Chad Hammel San Diegon told KSWB TV that he and his friends would be about half an hour in the morning of Saturday, when he heard that the child was shining to help the boy, and then a group of men began to walk away with him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel first thought that this was the kid's attraction, and then realized that "the kid's teeth on me!"
"He's kicked me!"
"He's totally warmed his chest," said Hammel, who took his son, that he was watching.
"I started to get out of the water for everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in Sudan," he added.
The boy was sent to the "Rady" Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his situation was severely appreciated.
It's the kind of assaulting dog.
The rescue team's captain Larri Cayls has shortly reported to the media that a few weeks ago the population was identified in the area, but that the species was not dangerous.
Cayls added that there are traumatic damages in the upper circle.
48-hour entry in Kasablad for investigation and safety purposes has been linked to the Svami entry in Esinitas from Ponto Cemetery to Esinitas Cemetery.
Cayls said there are more than 135 species of dog fish in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainbury's supermarkets plan to enter the U.K.'s beauty products market
Sainbury's expert aids, which consists of beauty products in the vitrines of the property stores, buys Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores.
Despite the tensions in the sales of fashion and home items, the UK continues to grow as an important step for the £2.8 billion beauty market, larger beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country's area and will be successfully tested in more stores next year.
Adding to the beauty area is sometimes the result of the search for ways to fill the tapes used for TVs, microwave clamps and home items.
Sainbury's reported that the number of its beauty products will be delivered twice to 3000, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more land than brands available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also releases its new cosmetic store on the market, so that most products will be suitable for the use of vegans, because this requirement is increasing among young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's stores, the first in the London South Bank store opened last week in Kroyd, and the second in the Seli Oak store open at the end of this year.
On-line shopping and daily local shops require small amounts of supermarkets to make more work to bring people to the market.
Sainsbury's chief executive director, Mayk Kup, said supermarkets will increase as much as the number of outlet shops appearing to be united by discounters who provide supermarkets with fine services and non-profit products, Aldi and Lid.
Sainsbury has placed Argos outlets to hundreds of shops, and has also offered a number of Habitat stores two years ago since they purchased both of them, which is said to have increased sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous efforts of the supermarket to renew the beauty and pharmaceutical horses were successfully achieved.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury had been unchecked with Boots, but this merger ended with the debates about the sharing of the income from the drugs that were opened in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after the sale of Sainsbury's 281 store dealership for £125 million three years ago, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical Cost to Selesio.
The four stores include La Roche-Posay and Vichy, adding a number of luxury leather slave products, said Lloyds would also be located in the plan.
Sainsbury's Commerce Director Pol Mills-Hiks said: "We have changed the atmosphere for our customers by increasing the appearance and quality of beauty products.
We have also invested in our special students who are willing to give their recommendations.
"Our brands have been designed in every form that suits them, and the charming atmosphere and comfortable places have now become a magnificent design of beauty as long as they are competing for the old-built style."
Holi Uillobin's cancellation of £11 million without the consent of Peter Consu
Television director Holi Uillobin's "Marks and Spencer" and ITV's new contracts to focus on his lifestyle brand without an agreement of 11 million pounds worth of £1 million.
Uillobin has no time for Truly, who branded them home items and accessories.
The company's business is similar to the GOP brand of the Qvinet Peltro.
"This Morning" (“This Morning”) announced that the 37-year-old manager of the program was separated from the Instagram account.
Holi Uillobi recently announced that Peter Consun left the business with the profitable lifestyle brand and focused on the new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that the "gold daughter" of the TV Marlou, when Cons reported the situation on Wednesday night in the business decision in Bukinshire, was quite angry - the new contracts worth £1.5 million reported that the Holi would be able to make a more home-time-access to the brands.
The company was similar to the Goop brand of the Qvinet Peltro, which would increase Uillobin's level of £11 million twice.
After the 37-year-old Uillobi announced he had left Truly on his Instagram account, Cons was sent to one of his holiday homes by leaving Britain.
According to the report, "Truly Holly is not within the priorities.
This will be the long-term future that will be able to ensure it in the next few decades.
His decision to resign was surprised by all of his colleagues.
No one believed that such a thing would happen so close to starting on Sunday.
There is still a full product in Marlow HQ that is ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the separation of the leader of the UK's most yielding stars "This Morning" program has been a shampoo and shampoo to the serious investments and products to the varieties of households and products that it holds up to wear, and to the company's delays to the market for millions of years.
This also means the end of long-term friendship.
The mother of three children, Uillobi, and his wife, Dan Baldvin, have had a good relationship with Cons and her husband, Tara Kap.
Uillobi built the Truly brand with Cap in 2016 and joined the brand's headquarters as a 52-year-old Cons in March.
Couples are going to rest in one place and Cons has 40% of money in Baldvin's TV production company.
Uillobi will be the M&S brand and will replace Ant Macparty in the I'm A Celebrity program of ITV.
According to a close source, Consa said last night: "We don't have a comment on her business issues."
"We talked to each other, and then we loved each other."
He denounced his opinions from the news media because some of them would consider the "non-presidential" behaviour and the positive attitude of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump have so much to do?
Trump said that he was watching the voice of the reporter who told him he was watching.
"I haven't passed away from anything."
He said that after the first meeting in Singapore in June, who was also interested in the second meeting, this was highly appreciated by Trump as a major step in terms of North Korea's nuclearization.
However, discussions on the process of reconciliation have been stopped.
After three months of the summit held in Singapore in June, North Korea's famous diplomat Ri Yon Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea's early disarmament acts were unable to receive "an answer" from the U.S..
On the contrary, he said the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in order to impose pressure.
Trump's speech was more optimistic about the issue.
“We’ve seen a great deal with North Korea,” he said.
"We're going to fight Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we've created a good relationship."
He stated that the development of relations with Who has demonstrated positive results in the implementation of missile tests, the release of turbines and the return of remaining American troops to the country.
And when he talked about his relationships, he defended his unfair attitude.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into a desert area with this guy, 200 people could have resisted," Trump said.
The island of Sunami and the island of Salt Lake City has been destroyed by hundreds of people.
For example, after Lombok was called, there was no need for foreign non-governmental organizations.
Despite the removal of more than 10% of Lombok's population from the territory, the country has not been declared a national disaster as a condition that facilitates international assistance.
"Fortunately, in many cases, it was quite clear that they didn't ask for international assistance, which makes the situation difficult," Mr. Sumbunq said.
Although the "Save the Children" team meets together to travel to Palau, we aren't sure whether the foreign office knows how to work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Agency for the Elimination of Flights, said that Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Paludaca to determine whether they are left to help international agencies.
If you are constantly looking at Indonesia, the country isn't ready to "read" nature.
Even if there are golden asylums in the open country, this is not a common sense for other coastal territories.
Despite the announcement, Paluda's sunami warning led to a clear conflict of people's lives.
In the best time it is difficult to travel between most islands of Indonesia.
Naturally, the logistics is still worse.
The Lombok hospital ship is heading to Pal, but it will take at least three days to reach its new disaster zone.
President Coko Vidodo has held the infrastructure in a heavy situation in Indonesia at the center of his election campaign and has allocated a huge amount of money to roads and railroads.
However, the disadvantage of the finance has made the Southern Coconut's administration difficult, and it is expected to repeat elections next year.
South Coko also faces the pressures of long-term excitement in Indonesia, where the ethics of the majority of Muslims are more protective.
Christian and Muslim supports have been killed by more than 1000 people and have been deported from tens of thousands of people's homes during the fight against the use of matte, spring, and other hard weapons.

A large part of the area of the cradle was "sleeved" from above, moving to the top of the door's top.
Finally, Kepa Arrizabalagan, which was put on top of the ball, passed over and fell to the door.
"I just tried to go to that position, get the ball, and players like Shake are always pushing the game as far as possible, so I have strived to create as much time as possible for myself," Starric LivepoolFC.com said.
"I saw Kanten coming, and I took the ball and shot without thinking much."
In the first half of the game, Chelsi was at 1-0 in the 25th minute, with Eden Hazard's arm thrown by the Belgique star.
At the same time, the attacker of the Chaldeans passed to Mateo Kovačić, fled to half of Liverpul, near the middle of the square.
The cowboys reacted and went into the middle of the event.
Then he got a beautiful shot and went into the hallway.
Hazard broke the defense line and the door of the Liverpool Alisson Bekeri shot through his left foot.

On Thursday, at 15:00 p.m. in London, the UEFA European League will meet with Videoton.
The number of Sunami victims in Indonesia increased to 832.
"The number of people who died in slaughter and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832," the agency said earlier Sunday.
"A lot of people occurred on Thursday and remained under the collapse of buildings distributed by the 7.5 honey-power waves caused by waves of 20 feet high," Sutopo Purvo said in a press conference.
In the city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people, the collapse of the buildings flying.

Parliament's last memorial victim in the "new history writers" building of Kromvel
Its "disturbance" would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban of many cultures and religious works of Britain carried out by the fanatic Puritans.
However, the Cromwell Society was appreciated to the proposal of the Southern Cricket as an effort to "rewritten" and "rewritten history."
Con Qoldsmiz, the leader of the Cromwell community, said: "In the current discussions on the removal of stories, it is impossible to escape that the building of Oliver Cromwell, located in the desert of Vestminster Palace, will be targeted.
In the British Civil War, no iconoclasm was ordered by Cromwell, nor was it carried out by him.
It may be that Kromvel's mistake was sacrificed for Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Southern Uilliam Hamo Sornekroft's introduction to Cromwell is a reflection of the thoughts that came into the 19th century and is a part of the history of the history that many still have come into being.
The Sunday Telegraph said: "Chromwell is honored by many, it may be that it was stronger than before in the late 19th century, and he was the defender of the monarchy against external pressures, when he looked at Parliament.
The fact that this is true is a matter of discussion in history.
It is clear that the conflict that occurred in the middle of the 17th century formed the next development of the people and Kromvel has become a well-known man who is part of it here.
As the Lord's guardian, his achievements are still being recognized and recorded with respect.

1-4 inches of rain will likely cause hazardous seals, breakthrough flows and riding in the desert.
The tropical air masses will be caused by a loss that reaches 2-3 buttons per hour, which will be observed in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Southwest, especially in most of Arizona, is expected to rain up to 2 to 4 pounds.
The rainfalls will make the situation worse because of the degradation of tropical rain.

More than 20 million people have been listening to the court of Bret Kawan
More than 20 million people on Wednesday night, Ali Makhmane's accused Bret Kavano and Kristin Blesey Ford, who accused him of sexual rape in the 1980s, watched his hearing on six television networks.
However, the equality of political opposition on Friday continued to issue a regular edition of the last minute change: an agreement offered by the Arizona Senator Ceff Fleyk to conduct a weekly investigation into FTB charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that it was 100 percent certain that Kavanon was trying to get it in a high school case and settle his clothes.
In his own statement, Kavana said 100 percent of the fact that something like this was not happening.
More than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday.
The company calculated its average number of reviews by CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately obtained for other networks including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem with calculating the number of people watching in the office.
Looking at the perspective, this mass number is similar to the number of football games or the number of "Academy" awards on the play-off stage.
The Fox News Channel, which strongly supports the project, has reached 5.69 million followers with all networks during the day-to-day trial.
The ABC has taken 3.26 million followers in second place.
According to Nielsen, CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, and CNN was 2.52 million.

Following the announcement that the Republicans on the scale of politics would vote for the Cavan line, he came to the CNN and CBS cameras when he stood up to listening to the court's lift on Saturday morning.
He was surprised to keep his eyes closed for a few minutes, and he was shown to be alive at the CNN.
"I'm here, I'm standing in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you know he's telling the truth to the country?"
He didn't say, "A lot of women are strong, you have your power."
Fleck stated that his party had made a declaration and that the lift was not connected, and there were more promises to be heard in the committee.
All cable TVs and live broadcasting networks showed the moments they voted live for the full Senate office of the Court Committee.
However, Fleyk said that the only thing he could do is to ensure that the FTB's fewer-organized Democrats will take a look at the protests in the next week.
Fleck's friend, Senator Kris Kuns, has been discussed in a conversation with the Democratic Senator.
After talking with a few senators and a few later, Fleck decided to make a decision.
Fleykin's election was strong because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have you for the approval of the Cavan's resignation.
President Trump ordered the FTB to look at the protests against Kavano.
The "political game" of Britain's Prime Minister May Brexit (the UK's withdrawal from the European Union) has been blamed.
Prime Minister Tereza Mey told the Sunday Times that the European Union was accusing the future of Britain's departure of their national interests from politics.
The British Prime Minister Tereza May took part in the Congress of the Defence Party, held on 29 September 2018, in the United Kingdom.
In response to a previous foreign minister Boris Conson Teresa's "development plan" for Brexit in a conversation next to him on the front page of the newspaper, the UK and the EU's proposal to collect recipes is "especially a fluctuation."
Uayd Sims laughed: Police arrested Dieteon Simpson, known for the death of an LSU player
The 20-year-old basketball player, Uayd Simsin, was arrested as a suspect in the murder of the LSU team.

The Department of Louisiana thanks the operational police group, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and regional citizens for their help to arrest individuals.
Co Alleva, LSU's sports director, thanked the legal and defensive bodies of the region for "security and justice."
Simmy was 20 years old.
The six-foot, six-number attacker Baton Ruqda grew up, and his father Uayn also played basketball in the LSU team.

In the city of Mexico, volcano storms
The popocatepetls of the volcano came to the southern province of Mexico.
According to the National Center for Disarmament, after the Mexicans were activated on the crater on Saturday, they were warned to stay away from the volcano area, and 183 gases and coal emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center observed numerous glorious voices and titles.
On social media images, such as Xoçimilko, the car seemed to be crushed around Mexico's city with a beautiful windshield.
In September 2017, geophysicians noted that after the flooding of 7.1 honey powers in central Mexico, the capital was 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the volcano.
The "Don Qoyo" volcano has been active since 1994.

According to local reports, it was treated for the small amounts that were received by fourteen people during the period.
A year after the referendum held on October 1, Madrid, the tension remains at a high level in the region in the independence demonstration, but this referendum is still recorded by the Catalan separator.
Elections have chosen the way to be independent, but the number of people who have participated in a large number of boycotts were few because of the departure.
According to Catalonia's officials, 1,000 people have been injured by stopping voters in the region where conflicts occurred last year.
Groups with the independence party are set down all night on Thursday to prevent the State Police's representation.
It's a lot of hope, but it's got a different reference to it.
The electrical engineer associated with separation with his partner said the 68-year-old Narkis Termes Catalonia had no longer hoped to win independence.
"We experienced one of the best moments last year.
"I saw that my parents were very happy when they spoke to me, and now they were shocked to us," he said.
Although the small victory won in the regional elections last December is important, this year, the parties, which are the independence party of Catalonia, are either self-conducted by the majority of the famous leaders of Catalonia in order to organize or organize the referendum in order to be announced as a follow-up.
The 42-year-old Xoan Puiq, who took his time with the support of the police, said that the conflict was disturbed by both sides of politicians.
"Whenever the situation goes, it's getting worse," he said.
Oriol Xunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in prison since the end of last Saturday, announced that he will participate in European Parliament elections next year.
"It's the best way to take the European elections in order to reduce the regression and repression that the Spanish government has shown to us in terms of democratic values," he said.

Livinqston Reyncers won 1-0 with his gun shot.
The first hand of Dolly Mengha won Livinxton
In the 18th game, Livinqston gave the Reyners his second defeat as manager of the Ibrox Club, Stephen Cerardan.
The Dolly Menga's arm, Qari Holt, proved to be different by lifting the side of Cybernesian to the second pillar.
This season, the team of Cerardan, who remained unwinnable in the Premyer League, will be faced with the leader Xarts who remained behind on Sunday with eight people.
Earlier, Reyners will host the Rapid Vyana in the European League on Monday night.
When Livinqston arrived last month, Kenny Mileri, who replaced Holta's defeat, was 6 in the league's defeat numbers.
Livingston hasn't been able to make sure
The Holton team had to go forward before they opened their account, their inter-play strategy created all kinds of problems for the Reyners.
Although Skot Robinson passed through the player, he remained injured in front of his arm, then Alan Lizqou passed forward to prevent the attack right to the door of Krey Halketin.
Homeowners said they would allow the Reyners to play in front of them, but they said they would be worried at some point.
And that's what he started with the shooting of the old arm.
The racers won a free shot, Livinqston's players were opened, Deklan Qallaqer and Robinson were joined against Mengha, who opened the right mid-door shooting account with the ball screw.
Although Reyncers kept the team's advantage, they were unable to secure the defence at the door, and the doorman Liam Kelli fell into the difficult situation.
Although Alfredo Morelos tried to prevent Kell, the game continued in the second half.
The king's door Allan Makqregor tried to keep Skot Pitma's wings with his hand, but Lizgou shot the ball with the wings of his foot.
The cruisers continued to cross Livinqston, but they were denied that Mr. Midlton's substitute was waved twice the penalty flag for the unregistered game of the People and the team's hand game.
"Fenomenal" performance from Livinqston - analysis
Toni Makaroni arena, Scottish actor Alasdair Lamont
It's a result of the performance and performance of Livingston.
And sincerely, they were great and they continue to keep their expectations on this path.
Although their style of play and stages have changed very little since they've returned to the top, Holta has been perfecting the team since the great prize has come.
He has a lot of heroes.
The captain also represented a good game and continued a wonderful defence, while Menga would prevent the ball from holding onto the feet of Konor Qoldson and Co Uorral.
However, the inspiration of Reynolds was insufficient.
Even if they were playing well as they were in the past, it would be behind their standards.
They didn't have a ball - they only once opened the defence zone - that was something like waking up for the Reyncers found themselves in the middle of the game.

The deaths and the deaths of hundreds of people in Indonesia have ended, and the number of victims is increasing.
According to officials on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of the large-scale slaughter and sunamic slaughter of Indonesia's Sulave Island, most of which have taken cloudy waves and thrown on the shore.
When hundreds of men gathered at the festival in Palu on Friday, the height of the waves reached six meters (18 feet) were thrown down on the shore, causing many people to die and spread everything that came to an end.
The offer was subsequently monitored with 7.5 honey beans.
"When people say that tomorrow is going to be in danger of sunami, they continue to work in the desert, they have not escaped, and as a result they have been victims of sunami," said Sutopo Purvo Nuqroho Cakarta's spokesman in a brief interview.
"Sunami didn't come alone, and he destroyed everything that came up with her cars, trees, houses," Nuqroho said, and added that Sunami was moving in the open sea quickly before reaching 800 km/h to the coastline (497 miles/h).
"Some people have been scattered into the trees to get rid of the sunny," he said.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated in the palace.
A number of scattered buildings and stores, dressed and flyed necklaces, and water, which was published by the agency for elimination of natural disasters, showed a large number of scattered buildings and stores.
After the flood, the city continued to run off the coast on Saturday.
In addition, there were 2.4 million people in the area.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the nuclear bomb was approximately 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb, which was released by the massive earthquake on Thursday during World War II.
According to the statement, the geographical position of the city located at the end of a long, hard bustle may have increased the number of sunami.

The Red Cross Society said in its statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and added that it sends their own lands and villages to the affected territories.
"It's already a disaster, but the situation can get worse."
On Saturday, the agency has been widely discussed as it did not provide information about how the sunami approached the Palace, but officials reported that the waves came when the warning was published.
In a social media amateur shooting, you'll hear someone warning people on the streets that the sunami approaches the building from the upper floor.
Within a few minutes, a large waterfall shoots off the coast and pulls down the buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the accuracy of the execution immediately.
There was a serious reduction in energy that led to the breakdown of the connection around Palu and sunami, which made it difficult to link the efforts of government bodies to rescue.
According to government agencies, military forces have begun to send help from Cakarta and other cities with cargo planes, but those evacuated still need a lot of trouble and other critical things.
The airport will be reopened only for aid work and will remain connected until October.
President Coko Vidodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Paludaka on Tuesday.

"They told me that many houses were broken down," he said.
That's very bad.
Although aid groups began to take severe measures to eliminate disasters, some of them complained about preventing the arrival of foreign aid workers with extensive experience.
According to Indonesia's laws, only if the disaster region announced the national disaster zone, it may start flowing from foreign countries to finance, supply and debt.
This hasn't happened yet.
According to Aulia Arrianin, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross Society, "This is still a natural disaster at the level of life.
"The government said, 'Yes, this is a natural disaster,' we can accept international assistance, but there is no such status yet."
On Friday, they hoped that on the second night in Paluda, the friends and families of those who were still lost would be one of the miraculous stories of natural disasters that fell behind their loved ones.
On Saturday, a young boy was removed from the channel.
The rescuemen rescued a woman with her mother's body for two days, staying under her tea stones.

Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he would never use military power against people because he was closer to the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against the country's students.
Lopez Obrador said on Saturday, "Tlatelolco Plaza will never use military power to pressure the Mexican people."

The U.S. government (Sunity Intelligence) has to increase its funding twice.
According to Google, Microsoft and Apple, investors and AI expert Kai-Fu Line, the U.S. should double the amount of funding paid to the research of this area as China has begun to become more active in the field of Chinese intellect.
Despite the lack of official AI strategy in the U.S., the U.S. government has received comments from various parts of the U.S. government.
In the same way, China introduced its plans to be number one in IT innovation by 2030 last year.
"Because other countries are farther back than the United States and we are expecting the next achievement in our IT field, the increase in the SIP budget may be a good start," Li said.
Li said this week, in an interview with the CNBC channel, that a double increase in funding can increase the possibility of achieving next major success in the United States.
Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishes this month the director of the Si Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Organization, Li, who is one of China's most famous companies in the field of SI, is the Chief Director of Sinovation Ventures Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on the Otellon, the strongest American player at Carnegie Mellon University, behind the IT system and was then executive of the Microsoft Research Team and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Li asked when the former U.S. government's Defence Perspective Research Projects adopted competitions such as "Robotics Challenge" and when the future contest will be held to determine the next visionary.
According to Lenin, researchers in the U.S. have to do a lot to win government clusters.
"It's not China, it's corporations," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have worked on the brightest models of universities to work on AI in recent years.
Li said that the change in migration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen the AI efforts.
"I think the doctor's degree of philosophy in the field of S.I. should be offered to the fields of auto-crypt cards," he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council introduced its New Generation Sunni Development Plan.
According to the line, the Chinese National Institutes of Natural Sciences Fund also provides financial requirements to people in academic workshops, as the National Sciences Fund and other government organizations allocate funds to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is low in China.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense, which planned to engage partners from industry and sciences, set the foundation of the United Union Intellectual Centre and announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Network Home Intellectual.
And this month, the Defence Prospective Research Project Agency (DARPA) has invested $2 billion in a contract called AI Next.
According to the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in its research year.

Macedonians voted in a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in a referendum on the adoption of the country's name, which has been a decade between the country and Greece, which can resolve the conflict between the European Union and its NATO membership proposals.
The Greek neighbor, a country called Macedonia, claims that the name of his country's neighbour in Greece is a claim to his territory and puts veto on his NATO and the EU's accession.
The new island, proposed by two governments in June, has basically joined the contract, but national leaders argue that this change will destroy the ethnic significance of the Slavic citizens of many organizations of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and the Baycot campaign raised doubts about the participation of at least 50 percent of the voters required to count the referendum.
In my referendum, the question was raised: "Do you want to agree with Greece for NATO and the EU membership?"
The parties to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a worthy price for entering the EU and NATO bodies to Macedonia, one of the countries created as a result of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I have voted for the future of the country today, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the "season" of the European Union, because this means a more safe life for all of us," the 79-year-old Skopje resident, Olivera Qeorgyevskaya, said.
Although there is no legal force, the parliamentarians have said that they will be able to meet the results in order to be resoluble enough to vote.
Two-thirds of the votes are required in the parliament for the adoption of the name change.
The State Election Commission has not been informed of the violations of the law until 13:00 p.m.
However, 66 per cent of previous voters voted in 2016, compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections, this time only 16 per cent of voters participated.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is Europe," the 62-year-old electorat in Skopje said.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his spouse Zorika and his son Duszko voted for a referendum on 30 September 2018 to join Macedonia, Strumitsada in NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene in front of parliament, and set stunts in front of the tents where people will set up a referendum.
"We are NATO and the U.S., but we want to join it in a sharp way, not from the 'end gate'," Kvadarkov said.
We are poor, but we have our lives."
If we don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can refer to other countries like Russia and China and we can become part of the European-Asia unity."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO unemployment rates will bring more than 20% of the need for investment in Macedonia.
I believe that the vast majority will be in line with this decision, because more than 80% of our citizens are side-by-side with the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that the result would be "because we're going to win."
Last week, a survey published by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that 30-43% of voters will participate in a referendum, which is lower than the required indicator of participation.
In another query held by the Macedonian Television, 57% of the respondents were scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for "because."
In order to be successful the referendum, the participants must be a 50% high voice.
Since the last year's failure of the referendum in May, western government will be the first to be seriously critical of the policy of the government.
See: Manchester's website player Serxio Aqüero Brayton's defence line has signed half-handed
Serxio Aquero and Rahim Sterlinq joined the Brayton team's defense line in the game wining at the Manchester City Stadium with 2-0 on Saturday.
The arm that Aquero shot in the 65th minute performed it in a simple way that seems to be ridiculous.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker agreed to transfer a passport from the middle of the crash.
Before he went out, he broke out between the three Brayton defenders and the three Brayton defenders.
After that, Aquero found himself in front of a four-year-old farmer.
He spread out from one of the defenders outside of Brayton's plot and passed through a few other players.
Then he went to the left side of the sterling.
The British attacker, with his first touch on the right edge, sent the ball back to Aquero to the right side of the door where Brayton's back door, Matthew Ryan, stood.
"He's fighting a number of problems on his feet," Manchester's club chief coach Pep Qvardio said.
"We talked to him about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happens.
"We've made it clear that he's got his hand in this article."
But in the Premier League, Sterlinq won the first advantage to the Coventri Site club.
That year came in the 29th minute.
In that game, the ball went to the foot of Aquerron in the area of Brayton, in the press position.
He went to Leroy Seyne in a beautiful way.
Seyn Sterlinqin kept the ball on his legs until he was headed to the side of the bulb.
The Coventri Siti (Sky Blues) club's attacker sent the door to the door without leaving the ball out of the line.
On Saturday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinshaym, Germany, the Manchester Site will meet the Hoffenhaym club at 12:55 p.m. at the Champions League group game.
Sherzer wants to participate in the game against Spoiler's Rokis club
The playoff race (the end of the season's solvent game period) didn't cause to take a new start with the Neyşinıls club that didn't leave.
But Sherzer, who has a competitive spirit, is hoping to participate in the game against Colorado Rokis club on Tuesday, but if there is a chance to participate in playoff games for the Rokis club, who has a game advantage over Los Angeles Dodcers in the Western League.
The Rokis club won a win of 5-2 on the Neyşinıls club at least on Wednesday night (without participating in any game, or in the event that they won the right to participate in the competition, a winning title card).
"Although we're playing any results without waiting for at least here, we're going to play together with Denver and other teams at the highest level that we're going to meet this year.
Why shouldn't I participate in this race?"
The Neyşnls club has not yet announced a starter for the game that will take place on Monday, but they are likely to allow Sri Lanka to play in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start for the 34th time, held training shootings on Friday evening, and would also be held on normal day of rest on Sunday.
The player shooting with the right hand in Washington is 18-7- with a line of 2.53 ERA (which the ball won against the team by the father, counted on the number of escapes in the game) and at 220 2/3 inninch this season (between baseball game) 300 straykauta (for failure).

"Everything we eat will be at risk in November.
It's one of the most important elections in our life for five weeks.
"I'm not doing anything, I'm not going to do anything, so I'm going to go anywhere to fight with strong fighters," he said.
Trump continued, "You see a radical Democratic group in this terrible degree, now you see what happened.
And they use all the means necessary to recover the power, you can see this humility, the dishonesty.
It doesn't matter who has hurt them to defeat their powers, who have to pass over them, but what they only want is power and authority, and we won't give it to them."
"The Democrats have chosen their mission to "exhibit a conspiracy and to protect themselves," he said.
"And you see what has happened in the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats angry, low, jealous and honest.
He emphasized the Senate's Court Committee, namely Diana Faynştay, which resulted in a loud hearing by listeners.
"You're in the answer?"
Have you seen that document?
Oh, oh, no.
"No, no, no, I'm waiting - it was really a bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
The Leyboric Party is no longer open to different ideas.
He is not tolerant to those who express his thoughts.
I wasn't surprised that I was going to be able to make a vote in my local party to make me feel a sense.
So I'm the last one of the members of the Leyborist Party, who are not well-considered because we voted for our free idea.
My colleague in my parliament, Con Rayan, has agreed with the same relationship because he has been strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I'm not going to agree with the boss, but I'm not going to agree with the boss.
Responsible economic policy, national security, European issues, the Ceremony has also fallen into the split of opinions with previous leaders, ironically related to such issues as the European issues.
In a statement of the Leyboric Party's announcement on Friday, "we want our announcements to be fair and productive."
As a representative of the local parliament of the Leyborist Party, a large part of the last eight sciences was also the general committee's vote on Saturday night.
It's sad that most of the myths today are not in this character, and the words that politicians say are "better, more careful" have long been forgotten, even if they really have started.
It is even more clear that in the Leyboric Party, it is not consistently accompanied by different ideas, and it is judged by the theory that any idea of the party's leadership has been accepted or not.
This, shortly after Cerem's arrival, I thought that I had shared the same political views before, my colleagues had started to change my thoughts hundreds of eight degrees and they would never start to agree with the positions in the marketplace in terms of security (million security) and in terms of aviation.
When I talked openly to the public - and there's no difference about what I'm talking about - calls for no vote on social media elections, long and serious talks are being spread to me, and I'm called Leyborists.
And I just didn't experience it.
I'm sure I'm more lucky because I'm going to have a lot more politically than I'm going to have.
I'm surprised to see the professionality and determination of my companions who aren't afraid of being exposed to many sexual and irregularities every day.
One of the most influential aspects of this era is the normalization of the different levels of mental force.
Last week, Ceremony Corbin claimed that the Leyborist Party should encourage the culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we are no longer open to ideas in a wide range, and each uncertainty moves to the party with a change in the rules of choice or choice.
I've heard a lot of stories that have encouraged me to get my head down and get out of my voice over the past two years.
But I didn't come to politics to do this.
32 years ago, as a schoolmaster, the fact that the word of our school symphony actually failed as a result of the Tetcher Government's inconvenience to join the Leyboric Party since I joined the Leyboric Party.
I've never hid my political views, except for the last election.
Nobody can't get into conflict with my political position and with the areas where I'm divided by the current leadership.
I will say to those who support that movement on Friday that if the UK leaves the European Union, it will harm the simple people, the business of the people, and our public services. In this case, my knowingly knowingly, I will continue to defeat the leadership of the Leyborist Party.
But really my message is not the moment, the representative of the Leyborist Party and my non-electioners: I am proud to be serving you and I promise that the threats and political resources to lose voice in the elections will be the best for you. I think it's the best for you.

Sections 38 - 17 Melrouz: It's up to the top of the no-defeat
The last two steps may have been the result, but it's definitely worth the victory of the funny Tennent Premyer League.
They are now the first to be the only unwanted team among ten teams.
As a result, the cause of the owner of the house was to make better use of the benefits of their superior defence line, and the coach Pitr Murchin has the right to be fully satisfied with the result of the race.
"We've come out of the tests in the games we've played, and we haven't been defeated yet," he said.
Robin Kristi, from Melrouz's team, said, "Now, they'd appreciate their chances better than us."
In the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's tournament, Frazir Klimo hit this tournament in front of the Ayr club, but the Scottish player Rori Hafsa, released by Uorriors, defeated Melrouza's yellow card and won the race against the team.
From the first half of the game's facility, the penalty officer attacked the Ayr club with a penalty summit, and turned his single-handed arm to the facility, opening his account as 17-5 in return to the Ayr club.
But Melrouz Club started well in the second half of the game. Patrik Anderson's district was handed over by Baqqot, and the account had a difference of five.
Ruarid Knotun was then a long facility with the severe injury heavily pulled out of the game. When the game was restarted, the Ayr club was re-inspired as a result of the turnover by Klimo of the club Stafford McDoual.
Then, Captain Bleyr Makferson received a yellow card, and again, Melrouz wanted to pay to another with the unchanged arm of Brus Kolvin at the end of the violent pressure.
The club who owned the house was revoked. And Struan Hatchinson received the yellow card for not having the ball in the arms of the slaughter. The MakFerson Ayr players were defeated in the contact form of a number of players to shoot the ball in the arms of the slaughter with the back of the motion to protect the ball in the arms of the slaughter.
David Armstronqun's footwear was collected by Climo Kayl Ro, and he shot his armwear as he restarted after sending the club's homeowner Henri to the interim for the fifth stage.
Still Game is expected to build a new career in the restaurant industry.
After the designation of the Ford Kiera's licensed restaurant company, Still Game will appear to be prepared to enter the restaurant industry.
Cek Cervis, a 56-year-old, plays the role in the popular BBC show, along with a long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
The actor's spouse announced that the final series will be in front of the nineth series, and appears to be planning a new life after Kiernan Kreiqlen.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
Although the actor refuses to report this, the Scottish Sun reports that Kiernan plans to be engaged in the business of the city's florising restaurant, according to sources of the news agency.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that judgment will bring them back to the Pacific Ocean
In La Pazda, the seafarers are patrolling the seaside.
At the beginning of the buildings, the flags of the ocean are flooded.
From the Titikaka Lake to the Amazon Sea Bases, the following are written: "The sea is our right.
It's our job to restore this."
In the 19th century, the historic memory of the coastline of Chile is still living in Bolivia that does not speak to the sea - like a desire to get back to the Pacific Ocean.
Following the five-year observation of Bolivia, the expectation of the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 shows that these hopes are the highest in the last decades.
"Bolivia has the driving force, unity and purity, and of course, we expect the outcome with positive ideas," Bolivia's diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Haag court will be forced to speak to Bolivia in a way that governs the sea after decades of the tragic work done in Haag.
Bolivia is hoping for the decision of the local president Evo Morales, who will take part in the re-elections in the next year, as well as for the decision of the court to be issued on Tuesday.
"We were very close to reaching the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is difficult for the judge to make decisions on behalf of Bolivia and to make decisions that will not make such a big change.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to go back to Chile, and this conditions it that this will not overcome the outcome of possible talks.
Only six months after the hearing of the judgment of the International Court of Justice, it shows that the issue does not have a particular character," said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law.
In the last four years, he resumed Bolivia's issue.
"The issue of speech to you has been used for political resources by the current Government of Bolivia," Zarate said.
He said, "The case of Morales's rhetoric has denied the good intention of Chili's roots."
Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks at any point, but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards.
These two countries have not been sent to each other since 1962.
Bolivia's former president, Eduardo Rodriguez Velts, has rejected the idea that the decision of the court would take place faster than normally.
"The next day, the possibilities to open a new era of relations with Bolivia with Chile will have a chance to end up 139 years of conflicts with mutual resources," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied the idea of Morales, one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, to use this maritime issue as a political tool.
"Bolivya will never go away from the right to leave the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This judgment is a good opportunity to see that we need to change what we have to do with our past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament until the U.S. rely on it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yon Ho said his people wouldn't be armed with nuclear weapons until he rely on Washington.
On Saturday, Ri was held in the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to take action in the summit between the leaders of the competing countries in Singapore.
U.S. government official Mayk Pompeon, North Korea's leader Kim Yon Un, was on the vote on restart of his nuclear diplomacy in an unexpected situation for more than three months after his meeting in Singapore.
Ri noted that there is nothing other than a fantastic feature that the U.S. will make for the U.S. declaration of the continued sanctions and the ending of the Korean war.
Washington insists that Pxenya should be able to give its consent to this statement if it does not see the first major disarmament measures.
The United States President Donald Trump also wants to set up a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism involving Pxenya's gravity as the only way to eliminate the weapon arsenal, which is considered to be the only way to guarantee security.
Pompeo will visit the city of Pxenyan next month for the organization of a second Kim-Tramp summit.
The Paris Fashion Show will show you the last round of your headwear in the closest Hay Strit (second street)
If you want to expand your main dresses even more, or you want to be completely saved from sunlights, then don't look for it away.
Designers presented a non-extraordinary series of headwears for large-scale SS19 collections in style in Valentino and Tom Broune Paris Fashion Week.
The non-practice main clothes caused a huge resonance in this spring Instagram, and these designers pulled out their stunning work.
Valentinon's most attentive work was the head of the models sitting in the heads, a part of which was in the beige color, dressed with a large scale like the creation.
Other large-scale accessories were included with precious stones, caduger head dresses and even ananas, but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Broune also represented the elections of a number of masks, and this is the case for Hellouin's celebration.
Many of the Rhingli masks also had super-built shells, and they looked more like the Hannibal Letter than "ot-cutur" (high fashion).
One of the new works looks like the oxygen balloon, the eye, and the snorkel, and the other looks like a married ice cream.
If you've got a good look, you can feel happy.
Those who are watching the style believe that the big head clothes will appear in the main streets near you.
The large-scale headwear makes a wonderful look with the shoes of La Bomba shoes, and the sharp headwear, which has two feet wide, appeared at all times from Rihanna to Emili Ratajkovski.
The cult label on the social media, widespread, non-practical headwear behind the podium, represented the next work on the podium - which means that the model, holding the bag in the hand, in the wear, is a very large-scale heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily heavily.
The refined refined refined bag, which will hold a grid to the top, has become the most careful accessory at the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitaj said to FEMAIL's dailymail platform: "I'm expecting that in the next spring I'm often expecting that large-scale garments and pockets will be used in the main streets - after such an impulse that the designer creates, there's no need for large-scale accessories."
Con Eduard: Language knowledge is very important for people at the global level.
Scotland's independent schools break records of academic excellence, and this will only continue with a number of attentionful examination results developed in individual sports, arts, music and other public efforts and collective successes in 2018.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (UNS) are trying to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools prepare for their students to grow up, higher education, to hold their places like their chosen careers and global citizens.
We observe that modern languages are popular in schools, such as an education system that can design and implement a personal school program, and that they continue to be a popular and desirable fan choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak with a person in a language that he understands, your words are focused on the brain.
But if you speak to a person in his mother's language, he is in the heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on the English language by building relationships and reliability with people from other countries.
We also see from the results of the last year's examination that languages in independent schools are at the beginning of rankings at the highest examination prices.
A, which is considered the highest price of 68 percent of all students studying foreign language.
According to the data collected from 74 members of the U.S. schools, 72 per cent of Chinese students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students received A price.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support children and young people's education of foreign language skills that are vital to life in the future.
Now languages are equal to the degrees of technology (science, technology, engineering and rationality) in individual school programs and other places as well.
In 2014, the UK found the causes of the efforts shown to fill the vacancies that employers announced by the commission of employment and skills. 17 percent of the vacancies were related to the failure of their linguistic skills.
Thus, the more important is the language knowledge of the younger generation to prepare for their future career.
These skills play an important role in a globalized world with more prospective business opportunities that language knowledge needs.
Regardless of the career a person chooses to learn a second language, skills such as this will gain real advantages in the future.
The ability to communicate with people from foreign countries automatically leads to the competition of a person who knows a lot of languages.
According to a YouGov survey held in 2013, more than 4,000 British adults, 75 percent of these people are unable to communicate a foreign language and only 15 percent can speak in just French.
Therefore, it is very important for the children of the day to learn language in our time.
Knowing more than one language, especially in the developed economy, will give children more luck to find better jobs in the future.
In Scotland, the languages that every school learns will be different.
A few of the schools, focusing on more classical modern languages, will learn the most important languages for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese and Japanese languages.
You will be able to choose the languages that match the interests of your children in independent schools where teachers work in their fields.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing their children with the preparation of their children and creating an educational education that will be skilled for future achievements.
In today's age, it can't be denied that languages continue to carry life's importance for the future of the country, so it should be reflected by this education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "International Communities Skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and excellence to young people in Sweden.
This must be done.
Con Eduard is the director of the Board of Independent Schools in Scotland.
LeBron will play its first game at the Leykers Basketball Club on Monday in San Diego
LeBron's Ceymes is now on the lookout for the first game in the Los Angeles Leykers club.
Leykers club coach Lyuk Ualton said James would play against Denver Naqqets club on Sunday in San Diego.
But it hasn't been decided for a few minutes to play.
"This will take more than a minute, less than 48 minutes," Ualton Leykers said on the official website.
Mayk Trudel, Leykers' club's writer, wrote on Twitter that James is highly likely to participate in the game within a limited period of time.
After this week's early training, James Leykers's six-game season plans were discussed with the graphics.
"I don't need a seasonal game in this field to prepare for my career," he said.
Trump's Clock in Western Virginie, YouTube Channel
President Donald Tramp started the campaign in West Virginia's Wheeling County tonight.
This is the first of the five myths planned next week, including those in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since Republicans are at risk of losing Congress' views during the vote in November, Trump plans to support the elections that will take place in the coming months in order to fill the validity of the Supreme Court's approval.
How many hours is the night of the trampoline in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, Western Virginia, will be scheduled to take place at 7 p.m., September 29, 2018.
Below, you can watch Trump's Western Virginie mitigation via YouTube.
During this week's investigation by the Federal Investigation Office, the Ali Court will review Brett Kavanao's report by the Senate's confirmation of the expected confirmation for a week in the court's trial of sexual assaults.
But the main goal of these myths is to help the Republicans win the speed of attack in the November elections.
According to the Reuters agency, President Trump's five-millions will take place next week aim to "power the majority of Republicans and parties to protect and expand the Senate and Non-Republicans' palace."
"Because we start the campaign season tomorrow, the president will visit as many states as possible as possible, Congress's supervision is very important for its day-to-day," said Reuters, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to name it.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this night's myth planned for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, "You can bring partners from Ohio and Pennsylvania and cross Pittsburgh media."
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, which won more than 40 percent of the population in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morris, a member of the Western Virginia Republican Senate, who will participate in the survey.
According to Reuters, Western Virginia University's political scholar Simon Haeder said that "the President's efforts to help him in surveys are not good for Morris."
Ryder Kuboku 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that it is ready to fight to continue its hopes of leading on-depth competitions on Tuesday
After a three-party event, Saturday's competitions may be what you need for this Ryder Cup.
The impulse of the injury is a concept that the players really believe and never have been in such competitions, fully adapted to the sport.
What's the point where the impulse is now?
"They've already had six advantages, and now they've already had four advantages, so I think that's why we're going to wear it like a small attack speed," said Jordan Spieth.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of crossing over four additional games.
As Spieth said, they feel that Americans lose their advantages and are inspired by Spieth and Justin Thomas to earn three honeys from each one of them, playing together at least all day long.
Spieth is shown as an example of gaining more people.
The further growth of these bulbs continued around, he and Thomas made a very important shooting while they lost two or two branches.
The shooter who won them in the 15th game was faced with the shocks saying that the American team did not believe that it wasn't.
"You have to work hard and think about your own game," Spieth said.
All of these players are left behind.
18 to make a difference.
In the past two days, the only players who gathered more than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
A couple who wins Europe's advantage, worthy of partiality, four-square, and that doesn't make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only single couple who won the race after Saturday morning, but they were fighting attacks at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday morning, Friday morning, and Friday morning.
In this round, it appears that their energy is defeated on Sunday and how the crazy mass impacts the players, and when Le Golf National is closer to the end, there will be no more famous players that will provide the possible victory of other Europeans than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Both of them are desired to be in different types at the same time.
It's still too early to talk about the victory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, together with Alex Noren, won Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning race.
In the previous nine tribes, there was no opportunity for the Spanish and the Swedish to get out of the situation.
No one will help you get out of the situation despite the day of Monday.
The mutual impact between the couples is incredible to observe closely their morning and day-to-day races in terms of the advice they give and what they don't give and how the strategy can change in a glance.
Europe has played better as a team to this day and has gained a worthy result to be presented on the final day, so that this day's race has been shown that the US team, particularly insecurity, has the power to fight in the United States.
The European Ryder Cup is at the top of 10-6 in the final.
In the European competitions on Saturday mornings and in the south, after 10-6 victorys in the U.S., Ryder is going to be more secure in the final of the Cup.
The couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have won two wins in the fight against Tiger Woods and have released their Le Golf National account in four.
Thomas Bjorn claims that Europe has kept the Americans in the Hazeltine competitions two years ago with a 3-1 account of the wrong techniques.
In the U.S. competitions, he won two games, so he couldn't match this account.
In order to keep Jim Furyk in the hand of a cockroach, he must win eight of the 12 matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood and Molinari, the first non-professional player of Europe to the back, won a week after the creation of "Molliwood", became the second partner of the first four games in the history of Ryder Kuboku.
After Woods and Patrick Reed were eight in the morning race, they were preparing for the defeated Woods and American non-professional Bryson Dechambeau to be defeated with 5-4 more effectively.
Woods, who participated in two games on Saturday, was playing with each other, but he was defeated at 19th of 29 games in the morning, south and backwards.
Justin Rose, preparing for the morning games, won Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 with his teammate Henrik Stenson in the competition in the south, and won a third ball in the world ranking.
In the south-east of Paris, despite the ruling of the day, the situation in Europe was completely different.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the difference between two Americans and two people on Friday.
They won 2-1 wins over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the morning, and they won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy's 4-3 accounts after they lost two matches at the start of their day-to-day competitions.
Ryder Kuboku's history had only been able to return to the game twice after four people's invasion, despite being forced to equate their accounts to protect Kuboku's parties.
However, after being the second in two days, the reverse attack appears to be something they can't do on Sunday.
North Korea says it's not going to be "released" without being "released"
In a statement, North Korea's foreign affairs announced on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions strengthened the insecurity of the United States and that it was impossible to refrain from the country's nuclear weapons jointly within these conditions.
Ri Yong Ho has seen an "important effort" to stop North Korea's nuclear and reactive tests over the past year at the World Organization's Annual General Assembly, to cut separate regions for nuclear radiation, and not to increase nuclear technology, including "important" action.
"We don't see a good answer to the U.S. issue," he said.
"We can't talk to the U.S. that our national security without faith can't be seen, and in this case we will never be the first resignation party," he said.
Ri said that the North Korean government would be awarded award-winning as part of the project's award-winning award, as a result of the fact that, as long as he had done in the past, it was a side-by-step complaint about Washington's contract of meeting complaints in relation to the past, as he had done in Pyongyang.
Ri, who promises to work in the term "Cleaning the North Korean Peninsula" and promises Trump to guarantee the security of North Korea on June 12 at its first summit in Singapore.
In the 1950s-53s, North Korea had been forced to end the Korean War in an official manner, but the United States said Pyongyang had to resign from its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also agreed to calls for the abolition of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is the first to put an end to our rejection of nuclear weapons, to increase the pressure from sanctions to achieve the goal in a challenging manner, and even to "exclude the ending of the war," said Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can break us is nothing but the expectations of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our independence."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump to be held in the United Nations at the beginning of this week.
In the past five months, Prime Minister Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae emphasized three strikes, and added: "If the issue of dismissal of these nuclear weapons was not the U.S., the Korean peninsula would not be disarmad."
Even the tone of Ri's death was so badly different from being in the United Nations last year. After Trump's "South-President Devil" Chimi suicide mission, the U.S. "missile man" was named after the head of the U.S. missiles in North Korea.
Last year, Trump, who threatened North Korea to "destroy naturally" in the United Nations, presented certain measures to take on the dismissal of some weapons, but that there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions continue to complete dismissal of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Saturday, "There's no time limit for this, it's not a problem if it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia are convinced that the UN Security Council has to award Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday the following: "We are also engaged in cooperative, defensive and controlled nuclear operations until the implementation of the security and enforcement of the Sanctions of the Security Council.
The Security Council aims to stop the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and has increased the sanctions that it has applied to North Korea since 2006.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.N. Headquarters and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again the month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo travelled to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said he had been injured for North Korea in just a few hours and accused him of conducting "class demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that the United States would see "contact action," as a result, a rocket area and a nuclear complex.
He stated that it is necessary to ensure the security of the "contact action" that he requested, which has promised Trump in Singapore, and thus that relationships with Washington will also be normalized.
Students in Harvard have a lot of time to take a break.
This year, the new course at Harvard University ensured that all the graduates of the university will be able to sleep more in order to fight the growing mass culture of all their "neighbours" who are preparing for classes using their cafe.
Students at a number of universities in the world have found that they have no imaginations regarding the basic issues of slavery to themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School of Sleep, and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, also said, introduced a course in this form for the first time in the United States.
He began to be inspired by the lesson he taught about the negative impact of insomnia.
"When a girl came to me at the end of the school, she said, 'Why do I have information about this only in the last course?'
She said she had never talked to her about the importance of sleeping, and that was a surprise to me," she told Telegraph.
This year's first-time course describes the importance of academic and athletic sleep skills for students and the extent to which their overall well-being is improved.
Dr. Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's healthcare service, said that after the students reached a serious difference in the week, the university decided to open that course.
The course combines a number of interactive tasks in itself.
In a section, there is a picture of the bedroom that contains coffee cups, pearls, teachers and caffeine, the impact of light, the impact of sports activities on sleep and the rest of the sleep regime.
In another section, participants are informed about the risk of long-term heart insomnia, stroke, depression, and stroke.
The map of the city of the university encourages participants to think about their daily lives with interactive spouses.
"We know that students will not change their behavior immediately.
But we believe that, as you have the right to know the effects of your cigarette smoking on your health, they also have the right to know," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, it is still available to "wake up all night," and it adds that increasing pressure on modern technology and students also causes the increasing problem of insomnia to become a daily problem.
Sufficient sleeping students are a "secret weapon" to fight with stress, fatigue and excitement. As they say that insomnia puts the brain into the hunger regimen, it constantly feels hungry, so it even leads to rooting.
19-year-old young Californian Raymond So, who studied in Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped her plan one of Professor Czeisler's lessons in Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and gave him a chance to develop the course within the university.
The next step is to require all graduates to pass the apparent teaching program before being accepted to competitive students.
Prof. Czeisler should also plan to install the clock when preparing for students to sleep, as well as to provide information on "blue light" information about the rhythms and problems of the human brain spreading from the screens or LED lights of electronic devices when awakening.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga Gerrard's team is defeated
Dolly Menga's hit, Steven Gerrard defeated his 1-0 account in Livingstone, suffered by Rangers without getting away from another tour.
The TIbrox team wanted to win their first wins since 4-1 in St Johnstone in February, but Gerard-married in the team as a manager in the team of Gary Holt's 18th team in order to depart his team's leads in the race of Labrokes Premyer League.
Seven minutes ago, Menga had been calling down, and Rangers wasn't fascinating to equate their accounts to join the ranking.
When the Rangers came into the sixth pillar, Livingston was in the third pillar with a pillar back from the Hibernian.
The judge Calum Spence had to be treated as a result of the destruction of the remote object, which in turn was an additional problem for the Rangers team.
Gerrard moved to Betfred Cup half-final in the back of the 8th round.
On the other hand, Holt gave Hearts advantage over the past week and equated his wife with Libya, 11 and he was pleased to be afraid of being prepared for the souls of his rivals.
Although the Rangers team had a ball, the Livingstone team gathered that they couldn't do it.
When Scott Pittmann turned to Alan McGregor's goal, they only won the race within two minutes, but used his semi-defensive chance until the end.
Keaghan Jacobs struck Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence companion Alan Lithgow only dropped a strong knife in the back position.
The Rangers took control of the team, but in the third final they had more hopes about the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought that the battle with Steven Lawless should be a penalty in the 15th minute, but judge Stephen Thomson came out without seeing this complaint of Colombians.
Rangers just shot two in the first half on the target, but Ibrox's former doorman Liam Kelly, Lassana Coulibaly, and Ovie Ejaria were openly concerned.
When Libya's 34th minute is going to be an open player, no one can deny what they have done for them alone and only for their hard work.
Rangers weren't able to deal with Jacobs' well-planned and managed game again.
Declan Gallagher, who was able to protect the ball's coolness and preserve it, did not react to Scott Robinson from the Menga team to finish the game.
During the Gerard process, Ryan Kent and Coulibaly were moved to change, and Morelos immediately showed this change his influence, but Kelly fled from his line.
However, with Lithgow and Halkett put the ball into long branches, Livingston teams were forced to play with the kind of game they enjoyed.
Holt's team could have extended its leadership in the last stage, but McGregor, Lithgow, had removed Jacobs before he had gone away.

Re: The Death of the Geiger
And now our "Monday Morning" page: on 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger opened eyes to the world in Germany.
Geiger, finally, created the device to determine and measure its authorized immigration, radioactivity, as well as recognition as the Witness.
Since then, Geiger, who has been regarded as a point of view of the scientist, has become a famous culture where unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play the lead role, as in the 1950s film "The Coronado Songs."
"What do they say in the world?"
Rogers said: "This is a Geiger Snake used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you attack these earrings, you can feel the atomic impact of radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "I think it's a science bomb ready for this explosion!"
"Hans" Geiger changed his world in 1945, only a few days to 63 years old.
But his name is still alive.
It is possible to learn how to see new cells in the immune system.
It is known to see new cells in the immune system and to teach them to destroy them.
As part of the treatment, Peyvond learns to identify the immune system with sensitive cells.
The method is carried out by removing immune cells from the patient, by changing their laboratory.
At this time, they see protein as commonly considered for a lot of cells and are re-injected into the body by injection.
The test test shows hopeful results for a variety of diseases in patients with a variety of diseases.
A woman who has been treated with pearl to learn how to recognize the body cells of the immune system has seen that the eggs are less than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of immune cells from a patient and the change in the laboratory for a protein called HER2, which is common in many types of cells, and then involves the re-injection of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the U.S. National Institute of Medical Diseases, located in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results are a very hopefully promising for us."
HER2 "reduces the development of a number of species of insects" includes diseases of eggs, eggs, oral and colorectal insects, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similarly, taking immune cells from the sick, how to "teach" them on the cells of the cells, worked in the treatment of the lechemia.
After showing himself in the SNL, he went to Diatribe, a Kanye West Trump's partner with his dressed MAGA hat.
It wasn't good.
After a statement, U.S. President Donald Trump praised, Kanye West entered the studio on Saturday night, and will be nominated to office in 2020.
In the evening, when the "American Ucalt" had voted for his third novel called the City of the Cabo, he told the Democrats a profound sweat and confirmed that Trump was supporting.
"When I'm talking to people on the web, they say, 'How can you support the tramp, he's a rebel?'
"You know, if there was a problem for me, I would have moved to a country outside of the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with the parish of Matt Damon, who expressed a jumoristic expression before the Senate's Court of Justice, on the sexual claims made by Christine Blasey Ford by Hollywood's studio Brett Kavanaugh.
Although this was not published, West-in's work was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It wasn't understood that Rock was going to West.
In addition, West complained to the developers that he had experienced difficult moments behind the back of his head due to the pope.
"They threatened me behind the scene
They told me I didn't get out of this hat.
They frightened me!
And then they said that I'm in bed," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see a bed?" he continued, "Write my superman head, because you don't know what to do to me. Do you want to go to the world?
Try to love."
Variety stated that his opinions were at least twice supported by developers and that the SNL actors were ashamed: "The entire studio was a dead silence."
West, a few days ago, was brought to the last minute to play his old lover singer, Mac Miller, instead of Ariana Grand.
The West Perrier Bottle was dressed like the West Perrier Bottle.
Candace Turner, head of the West TPUSA protective group, tweeted: "I'm going to be a member of one of the most courageous spirits: MOB's LOVE."
Karen Hunter, the leader of the show, said, "West looks just like it is, and that's awesome."
"But I don't want someone to choose that I'm going to have a bad ideology for my society and I think it's spreading it (by taking it's music or dress, or by supporting it's "art").
He's free.
"It's like us," he added.
Before the show, the reper changed its name via Twitter and reported that "it was already officially recognized as Kanye West."
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and Puff came from behind Diddy, known as Daddy, Puffy, or P Didd.
Reper Snoop Dog's previous scene was Snoop Lion, whose famous music character, known as Prince, changed his name as a symbol.
A man who was arrested in Belfast's restaurant was killed by a knife.
On Friday, a 45-year-old in Belfast was accused of pushing a man to knife in a restaurant.
The police said the incident had happened in Ballyhackamore.
The suspect is expected to be faced by the Belfast Court on Monday.
The Republican Prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington's series of taxt games highlights the stereotypes of people.
Kit Harington is renowned for the brave role of Jon Snow in Taxt games, HBO's medieval fantasy series.
However, when a 31-year-old actor is opposed to the stereotype, he says that such roles on the screen must be hard to think of young men to respect.
Kit, who interviewed the Sunday Times Culture, said he thought something was wrong and talked about how to solve problems related to men's stereotypes in the #MeToo century.
Kit, married to the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who recently agreed to Taxt games in the series, said that she feels quite ready to find a way to solve this issue.
"I'm personally ready to understand the stereotypes of our personality right now?" he said, "I'm pretty ready to find the answer to the question."
"What do we learn about the problems that we have seen when we grow up?"
The person we see on TV also believes that stereotypes have a role in creating this problem.
He said, "What are the things that are learned from birth and later?"
What are the stereotypes about being young people on television and in the street?
I think this is one of the most important questions we have to answer today - how can we change this?
It's because it's hard for young people to have stereotypes.
In the meantime, he told him that he was rising from battle scenes and horses, and after the next release, Taxt games would not participate in any entry and continued episodes.
From November to November, Kit, a filmmaker, and his son's brother, will be the film's film of Sam Shepard's Real West Racing.
Acter believes that dating his spouse Rose is the most beautiful thing the Taxt game series has put into her life.
"I met my husband in this series so that this series gave me my future family after my life," he said.
Rose revived Ygritte, who was a love relationship with Jon Snow, whom Kit married in the award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, she married Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports that the number of patients with this disease has increased by 14%
China, HIV and Citizens have announced an increase of 14%.
According to social workers, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new events were recorded in the second half of 2018.
Most of the new events have passed through a gender that has highlighted a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is rapidly spreading as a result of the transmission of blood in some regions of China.
According to the Chinese health officials at the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people caused HIV infection was reduced to zero.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has reached up to 100 thousand years ago.
Transmission of the HIV virus through sexual intercourse is one of the main problems of the LGBT community in China.
Since 1997, homosexuality has not been considered a crime in China, but it has accelerated the separation of homosexuality.
Surveys have shown that 70-90% of males who have sexual relations are married to women due to the country's defensive values.
The reason for the transmission of many of these diseases is that there is no inappropriate protection of sex in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal talks to the drugs necessary to treat HIV disease, even though it is part of the issue.
Maxine Waters reveals the information of workers about the Republican Party's senators, reports, "these lies" and "theories of freedom"
U.S. Non-Numbers on Saturday, Maxine Waters said that one of his workers, the three Republican senators in the United States, had personal information on the pages of national officials in Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles said claims were scattered by experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more deceitful," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information was reported to contain home addresses and telephone numbers by the United States Senators. Lindsay Graham, Utahdan, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from South Carolina.
This information was published on Thursday evening by an unknown person in the Capitol Hall, the Ali Court ordered Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing of the Senate panel of allegations on sexual behaviors.
The complaint came out after three senators were interrogated by Kavanaugh.
Hill, Gateway Pundit, and RedState have reported that the IP address, which determines the source of defeat, belongs to the Waters office, and that one of Waters' employees has published information.
"These claims are not entirely basic and unfair," Waters said.
"I have no responsibility for the disclosure of the identity, personal data, and security of my lies as a result of false and false claims.
These claims are not entirely fundamental and unfair but a liar."
Waters's statement also led the old news agency Ari Fletcher to the center of the network.
"That's a lot of angry," Mr. Fletcher said.
He said, "It continues to say that there is no desire to be a member of the Congress.
If anyone does not sin against them, they should not be angry.
They shouldn't show disobedience.
They should not ask questions about the purpose of the accused.
They must be quiet and quiet."
Fleischer compared the reactions of Waters' Democrats in the judgment on Thursday night, which was offended by the Judge Kavanaugh's judgments by appearing quite selfish.
In the interim elections, Omar Navarro, a Republican who had deployed Waters, also called for his thoughts on Twitter.
He said, "If it's true, it'll bring a voice."
In the Waters statement, it continued to warn the office of the authorities and the law enforcement bodies on the basis of these charges.
"You can be sure that we will reveal the Chinese," he continued, "that they will be legally responsible for the people and all my members of the community that they are acting in destructive and dangerous ways."
Johnny English Against Assault - Rowan Atkinson's Sword Parody
In the UK's approach now, it has become the traditional way to look for the importance of Brexit, and it can also be applied to Johnny English's back-to-screen film, which began to appear on screens for the first time in 2003 and returned to screens with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Do you want to show us how we're going to be an exhibit on the new export capabilities of our nation?
In any case, there was a license to restore the second time Johnny English's clean, refined, unexpected updated things that was a kind of funny creativity designed for non-english cinematography areas.
Of course, despite the strange beauty claims, he is a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a little bit secret at the opening of the 2012 London Olympics, which prepares a small record on the topic of the Alov's cars.
At the beginning, Atkinson has now been forgotten, and has played on the TV ads of Barclaycard about travelling and silly people from different countries behind the chaos.
There's a few moments to be presented in the last JE trips.
I liked Johnny English, who was dressed in a dressed and touched on a crash and approached the helicopter in the middle of the century.
Atkinson's physical comic ability finds its opposite on screens, but such humor appears quite weak and strange, especially in movies like 007 and "grave" films, comedy is already presented in a remarkable manner of content.
The humor of Johnny's English film is more than adults, and for me, the failures that passed by Johnny's English weren't like the Bean character of Atkinson's quiet-kino genre.
Currently, many important celebrations show that the UK is in serious danger.
Cyber-hacker has broke into the very secret web of Britain, and has put all of the British craftsmen who are currently at the start of the job in danger of the craftsmen who are currently performing their job – unfortunately, Kevin Eldon has been given a very small role.
This was the last drop of the Prime Minister's patience, who had a claimed and alleged personality, and who had already collapsed in the political population: Emma Thompson expressed the image of Theresa May very well, but there was nothing to work in the scenario.
His discovery advisers told him that after the identity of the prisoner in each task was disclosed, he was forced to go out.
This means that unqualified Johnny English now acts as a teacher in some well-known structures, giving other lessons about how a secret operation will be carried out: Johnny English casus learns some stories like a casus rock type casus academy.
Johnny English was invited to Whitehall for an urgent congregation and he meets Bough, whom Ben Miller revived, who is close friend for a long time.
Bough is now a married man who prevents his submarine commanders, Vicki Pepperdine's defence, showing himself happy.
Thus, because the Secret Service wasn't all right, Batman and Robin returned to their positions, and here they faced Ophelia Bhuletova, the woman's image in the beauty that was originally revived by Olga Kurylenko.
In the same way, the prime minister is under the influence of a foreign technology billionaire who claims to save the UK from computer statement: Jake Lacy revives Jason Volta's image.
English and Bough start with a smiling and fun trip: the flowers are buried in an office library at the French restaurant; they create a mixture by flying abroad in front of Volta; the English Virtual Reality listeners want to meet Volta's home.
They've worked hard for this latter movie, but there are many channels for children about all of these honest and fun things.
It's quite a matter of things.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't keep myself thinking: Didn't the British film industry Rowan Atkinsona really play a role that suits his abilities?
The working school refuses to plan to buy a five-day machine by working four days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party considers a radical plan for the British working five days to take over the labour rights of four days.
According to the party's report, the company's directors can add days of rest to employees through the intelligence system (SIN).
This means that the employees will have the same salary for three days on the weekend.
According to sources, this issue is in the economic day of the party and they are planning to convert it to the employees.
In order to benefit from the economic change of workers, the Trade Union Congress confirmed the transition to the four-day working regime.
Sources of the Big Labour Party told Sunday News: "The political agenda is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This is not something that will happen in a night, but the four-day economic regime is a means that balances the worker's position, and also a means that fits the party's overall industry strategy in equality."
The Working Party is not the first party to confirm the four-day work regime, but the Green Party promised the four-day work regime for the first time in the general election company in 2017.
However, it is currently not fully approved by the Workers' Party.
The working party's representative said: "The four-day working regime is not in line with the policy of the party, and this is not considered by the party."
John McDonnel used the Labour Conference last week to explain the socialist conversion in the economy.
The Chinese McDonnel said that the power in municipal companies was determined to get back from "individual directors" and "individuals."
Different cancers also claim that the existing workers in the water companies can't recover the mistakes, because the Labour government can take some foods, taking into account its alleged sui-istifate.
He also confirmed plans to establish a Internal Safety Fund for the inclusion of employees in the departments of the company and to deliver 10% of the private sector capital to employees, up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, said FTB's "60 Minutes" will not change their views and change their views.
The FTB Judge Brett Kavanaugh's investigation into charges against the Supreme Court, suspended his vote for at least a week, and revoked the support of any Republican Senator's findings, asking if he would not.
On Sunday, Scott Pelley issued a "60 Minutes" issue to Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether FTB couldn't find anything that could change their thoughts.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than the South Carolina side agreement.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I went and talked to the judge Kavanaugh.
When these claims came up, I called him, "Did you really do that?"
He was unclean, determined, and clear."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be stable.
"My thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh have been cleared and it will stand against strong accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I can say that: Brett made it seriously," Graham Christine Blasey added.
"Everyone who named him couldn't confirm that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and what does it do to reduce poverty?
New York will host the same mission of all stars on Saturday: the annual music concert that gathers together to finish the world's poverty, will host home to the Global Citizenship Festival.
For the seventh year, the Global Citizenship Festival has given tens of thousands of people the opportunity to enjoy stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes at the Central Park's Great Workshop, as well as the main objective of the action, which is to be linked to each other, was to stay in the world by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which has been held since 2012, is an army of the Global Poverty Project, a global defence group that hopes to end the world's poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against poverty.
If you want to get a free ticket (if you don't want to get a VIP ticket freely), the concert participants should take a series of calls such as calls to world leaders to eliminate poverty worldwide.
But how successful is the 12-year-old nationalist festival in order to be a nationalist?
Is it an original way that people will be able to sign petitions online, send a tweet, or change by gathering signatures, that is, "cliquidism"?
According to the Global Citizens Unit, since 2011, more than 19 million of its parties have been actively engaged and they are striving greatly to achieve their goals.
He said that these actions taught the world leaders to make statements about cohesion and politics, to help more than $37 billion in people's lives, affecting more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
According to a 390 statement, the group noted that the fund was accumulated more than $10 billion due to its activities in early 2018.
The group estimates that approximately 649 million people from around the world have funded money to date.
Some of the main challenges, which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help Glubal Citizens have received more than 4,700 tweets in the country after they have been able to make sure that there is more than $35 million in the country.
"The UK government, donors, national governments and the support of Global Citizens as well as you can find social injustice related to insufficient nutrition in history," said Ullmann of the Power Fund in London in April 2018.
After more than 5,000 activities have been carried out in the UK, the group also focused on improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has suffered 5 million women and children who are able to help the child with a cost-effective commitment, adding that the food
The group's most common questions on the website are asked, "What do you think you can end poverty based on this?"
The global citizen replied: "This is a long and difficult way - sometimes we're going to fall, sometimes we're going to lead to failure.
But we'll be successful, just as we have the rights of the former big citizens and the movements against the independence in South Africa, because we're stronger together.
This year, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman have Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and Janelle Monáe.
U.S. Navy can be blocked to prevent Russia's energy exports by using the U.S. Navy
Washington Examiner, U.S. internal affairs officer Ryan Zinke, said it would be able to address the military naval fleet to the world market, including the Middle East, if it needed.
Zinke argued that the Syrian industry, which was active with the invitation of the Russian government, was a challenge to investigate the new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their being in the Middle East is that they want to save energy like Eastern Europe, which is the central south of Europe," he said.
According to official information, there are ways and means to resolve this.
"Because the U.S. maritime routes are open and their energy will not be exported to the world market, he will use military navy for the purpose of blocking," he said.
Zinke, a non-commerce group in the U.S., and himself as the "voice of energy consumers," referred to the participants of the action that the Consumer Energy Authority owned.
He reported that they were equally effective by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran.
He pointed out that the country, which owns Russia's fossil fuels, "is just something that comes from its own hand," "the economic choice for Iran and Russia means a change in less or more degrees of fuels."
The aim of the Trump administration is to replace the Russian gas, which is the cheapest option for European consumers, by increasing its exports to Europe.
For this reason, U.S. President Donald Trump's officials of the Trump administration, according to Trump, Germany will "effect" Berlin Moscow, attempting to dismiss the "free" Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
Moscow has pointed out that it is a total project of $11 billion in the Nord Stream 2 square, which will reach 110 billion m3 twice.
The Kremlin stated that being against violence against Washington is simply due to economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak in Moscow, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, said in September: "I believe that I don't have a means to press the energy and that consumers are free to choose the investors."
The U.S. position again confirmed its loyalty to the state, due to Germany's reverse reaction.
The German Industry Federation (ASF) of Germany called for the U.S. to refrain from the European Union's energy policy (U.S.A.) and from the bilateral trades between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (ASF), said after the last meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: "The involvement of a third state in our energy supply is a major problem for us."
The Massachusetts state senator, Elizabeth Uorren, said the presidency would be "award-award" in 2020.
The Senate of the State of Massachusetts, Elizabeth Uorren, said on Saturday, after the interim elections, that the presidency would "respect the country."
Uorren Massachusets state has confirmed that the Holyoke City Board of Directors thinks to move forward during the general assembly.
According to the newspaper "The Hill," Warren said, "the time is for women to recover the defeated government, including women, including the defeated women."
"I'm going to take a look at the presidency after November 6th."
During the general assembly of the city council of Uorren, President Donald Trampa stressed his thoughts on "he leads this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm so sorry about what Donald Trump has to do with our democracy," he said.
Uorren, Donald Trump, and his Supreme Court, have expressed his opinions on Brett Kavanaugh.
"We need to be investigated by the Federal Investigation Office (FBI) before it is voted," he said on Thursday.
A survey released on Friday showed that most of Uorren's voters did not think they should continue their presidency in 2020.
According to a survey of the Suffolk University's Political Research Center/Boston Club newspaper, a percentage of the "probably" Massachusetts state's voters should continue to lead the Senate's position.
Twenty-three percent of the voters were supported by the vote.
The survey showed that 38 percent of voters' potential support and 48 percent of Governor Deval Patrick's support was further supported by the previous Governor Deval Patrick's support.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Berni Sanders.
The Associated Press agency reported that Biden had officially decided to make a decision by January.
According to Sarah Palin Donald Trump, the son of Track Palin's posttraumatic stress disturbance (PTSP).
The 26-year-old Track Palin has spent a year in Iraq after his appointment in September.
He was arrested on Saturday night and accused of domestic violence.
"I can get a relationship with other families and some injured people who feel the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSP) that my son is living, returning, and returning," he said.
Palin's self-detention was "named a pillar in the room" and, in connection with his son and other war veterans, "they returned a little differently, they returned as excited, they returned and gave to the country the honor of all other members of the army, friends, pilots, and other members of the army."
According to the representative of the Wasilla Police Administration Dan Bennett, he was arrested on Tuesday in Alyascat, in Wasilla, and accused of having been prosecuted for domestic violence against a woman in a violent situation and interfering with a document of domestic violence.
18 states, the Colombian region supports the call for new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the Colombian region support a legal call against a new U.S. policy that denounced the need for refugee victims from the band or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 states and region representatives were chosen to support the person seeking asylum against politics on Saturday in Washington, Washington, Amicus curiae (the court expert).
Grace's full name of the complainant at its sessions claims that the U.S. Civil Liberties union, which claims against federal policy in August, has not been discovered.
He said his partner and members of the Sanctuary Band that his sons had made him a sushi-istifate, but the U.S. officials fulfiled his asylum requirement on June 20.
He was kept in Texas.
Countries in El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, which have addressed many US refugees for supporting Grace, have described countries facing major problems with bands and domestic violence.
U.S. Refugees from domestic violence to take new asylum policy cancelled the 2014 Apellation Council decision.
In a statement by the Prime Minister of Colombia, Karl Racine, on Tuesday, said the new policy "is not subject to state, federal and international law, which has persisted over the last few years."
"The federal law requires that all requirements for asylum be assessed according to the specific facts and conditions of the requirement, and that such a bar principle is violated," he said.
In short, lawmakers reported that the policy that denounced the acceptance of immigrants was higher, the likelihood of being owners and providing "subsidy" was harmful to the U.S. economy.
Attorney Chief Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to provide more asylum to victims who escaped the violence of the band in June.
"It is possible for those who leave refugees, religions, nations, or any specific group to be members of the country because of evil or fear."
Asylum seekers haven't planned to solve all of the problems they face every day around the world.
In order to find the left, the number of deaths increased twice as a result of the desperate rescue efforts in the Palace.
It was more scary for those who were left right.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said, "She feels very excited when she's relaxing her boyfriend in the evacuation center in the city of Palu."
"Every minute ambulance was brought.
It wasn't clean water."
When the people returned to their homes, collected their watered things, and found everything they could, they would be trying to save them.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals injured by 7.5 honey power were demolished.
Dwi Haris, who suffered from anxiety and heart disease, remained in the desert of the Palu Army Hospital where patients were treated in the open air because they continued to have strong necklaces.
He was very sad when he was talking about his feelings when his wife and daughter shared with him on the fifth floor of the hotel.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Haris, adding to Associated Press that his family was in the city for a toy, said, "I think I've stayed close to the broken walls."
"I heard that my wife was crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what you're doing to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. airline is accused of compulsory Chinese advertising.
A week later, a four-page announcement of the U.S.-China trade revealed the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade. The U.S. driver was accused of using the American message to spread Beijing to advertise.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday night, accusing China of participating in the elections at the U.S. congress on November 6, called for the daily payment supplement in the Des Moines Register - the most selling newspaper in Ayona.
Trump's allegation of trying to confuse Beijing's U.S. elections, Reuters' U.S. officials said it was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to promote trade, advertisements are currently being placed in a growing trade war that has seen the levels of taxes on each other in the imports of Beijing and Washington.
According to Chinese and U.S. experts, during the early trade war, Chinese response rates were intended to strike exporters in countries such as Ayova supporting the Trump Republic.
The U.S. driver and former long-term governor of Ayova, Terry Branstad, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said he had damaged Beijing's American workers, farms and businesses.
On Sunday, Branstad wrote a comment on the Des Moines Register: "China has doubled its level of burden by publishing advertisements in its own free news."
"When the Chinese government publishes its advertising, it is used to use American free talks and free news by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register," he said.
"On the contrary, you will find limited different voices in the streets of the newspaper in Beijing city, and you will not see the true opposite of the various views of the Chinese people about the problematic economic tractor of China, because the media is under the hard head of the Chinese Communist Party."
Despite the fact that he didn't say what a newspaper he was, he added that he didn't accept the proposal to publish the article "one of the greatest newspapers in China."
Republicans faced women's elections with Kavanaugh Debacle, analysts warn
Many Republicans in the Ali court, Brett Kavanaugh, defending against sexual assault claims, said the analysts would see a reaction from especially women during the nearby elections.
The feelings that contained them were last high and most Republicans show that they want to move forward with voting.
"These things can't be backed up," said Grant Reeher, a political scholar at Syracuse Maxwell School University, to Hill for the article published on Saturday.
Reeher told the FBI that Senator Jeff Flakein (R-Arizona) had doubted that he would do enough to calm down natural voters in the last minute.
According to Washington, D.C., "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it in the morning and November," said the MoveOn Group's chief advisor and national representative Karine Jean-Pierre on Friday.
Representatives voted on Friday morning, saying "November is coming!". Republicans who managed the Court Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported on the Senate's corridor because they decided to be executed by Kavanaugh's order.
The party's political analyst Stu Rotenberg reported that "Democracy will be on the outside of the graph and motivation."
"People say they're already high, that's true.
However, in particular, women in the city and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age may be more among those who don't like the president.
Ford has announced that it has prepared sexual assaults against the Ali Court, and analysts have reported that Republicans will see it back when they are confirmed.
According to NBC News, last week, President Michael Steele of the National Committee said "This has become a confusion for the GOP."
Guy Cecil, a U.S. director of priorities, a group that helps the Democrats to choose, said by pressing the news channel, "It depends on how the Republicans have won it and how they are referring to it, not just to the committee or last voice."
But by believing in the words behind Ford and Kavanau, Americans are a little bit more closely combined with the last one.
YouGov's new survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents would believe in Ford's statement, 35 per cent would believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of Kavanaugh's witnesses are likely to say that he is a liar or only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
"After being accused of Flake, the FBI is investigating Ford's allegations and at least another accused Deborah Ramirez," Guardian said.
Ford said last week, speaking to the Senate in front of the Court of Justice, that Kavanaugh had been attacked at the age of 17 in a severe manner.
Ramirez claims that in the 1980s they studied in Yale during a party they attended, the Ali Court had exposed their sexual bodies to themselves.
World Wide Web publishers plan to start a new Internet to participate in Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Li, from the World Wide Web, is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrup, the most recent project of the technology industry, is Berners-Lin's open-source platform Solidini.
Solid users can choose where the data is stored and what personal data can be accessed.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Li has already achieved the goal of the "world dominance" of the Interruption.
"We are forced to do this now."
"This is a historic look."
These applications use Solid technology that allows people to create a "personal data warehouse" online.
This can consist of contact lists, lists of things to be seen, recording, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature in the online storage of personal data is that how to obtain the data is completely dependent on the user.
The company calls it "personally strengthening through data."
According to the company's executive director John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is to bring resource, process and suitability to the company by providing the use of Solidin by everyone.
Currently, Berners-Li, Bruce, IBM, IBM, is composed of a number of employees and affordable codes that are contracted to work in the field.
From this week on, people who develop technology around the world can create their own focused applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said they had not talked to Facebook and Google that all of their business models would be fully improved at night.
“We do not allow them.”
In an article published in the media on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inruptun is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the new web content and quality built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Li, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created the Internet by the World Wide Web Consortium.
In the last few months, Berners-Li has been an effective voice in the clear impartiality discussions.
Even when the intervention begins, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Fund and the Institute of Open Data.
Berners-Li said, "I'm incredibly optimistic for the next course of the Internet."
Bernard Vann: Victoria's Cross Church won the fame during the First World War.
As a warrior during the First World War, the only church in England that won the Victoria Cross was celebrated for 100 years.
Lt. Col was awarded by Bernard Vann on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
But four days later, he was killed by the snayper and never knew that he had lost the highest British military force.
The memorial stone was opened on Saturday by a parade by two substitutes of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his names, said that the award-winning defeat of his father was "unclear symbol" 100 years later.
According to London's newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann "followed his batallion with a heavy fire under "Canal de Saint-Quentin" with very narrow seeds and fields and pulemies.
Later, the firefighter fled to the line, and caused the line to be lifted in a hurricane before three people were thrown into the ground with a single hand, and three people were thrown out of the support.
Lt. Col Vann was killed by a German snayper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said that his father's actions were "what I know I can't live without."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were dismissed after the parade was managed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Group.
Michael Vann added that he is "more proud of participating in the paradise, and that the heart of support is demonstrated by the true hero of many people."
In order to watch Bellator 206, the MMA teams stayed in sleep all night, instead taking Peppa Pigi.
Imagine that you're here to watch Bellator 206 full of the night to stop watching the main event.
San Jose's office consists of 13 battles, including six of the main cards, and was displayed live during the night in the 5th channel in England.
In the morning at 6 p.m., Gegard Mousa and Rory MacDonald were amazed at changing the apartment as Peppa Pig.
Some weren't affected, especially after waking up until early hours for fighting.
On Twitter, a partying child's transition to the film as "a kind of patient benefit."
When asked about transfer, Vice-President of Marketing and Communications, Bellator Dave Schwartz, said, "The government's regulation must pass into the child's program because it's not compatible with this content in the morning at 6:00 p.m.."
"Pappa pig," he said.
Bellator's head Scott Coker said they would work on their own planning work to include UK followers in the future.
Coker said, "I'm sure I'm going to think about what I'm going to do."
But there was 6 a.m. on Sunday morning and we wouldn't be able to do this until Sunday.
But we're working on it.
There were a lot of texts that were moving backwards when I was opened, and no one was comfortable.
We tried to fix it, and we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I promise you won't happen next time.
We tried to do more than six battles as usual, and we didn't care about it for the Azerbaijans.
This is an unsuccessful situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels worthless about gender.
The Olympic wave, Tom Daley, told him that he had grown up because of his gender, and he felt worthless, but it gives him motivation to win success.
According to the 24-year-old, he didn't know that "anyone was like me" until he went to school.
The first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne also announced that he had a conversation about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also told him that his parents had to pay less attention on the topic of winning the Olympics.
The long-lasting show, Kirsty Young, has been allowed for several months for the cause of the disease.
Daley, who appeared as an escape in Laverne's first program, when he grew up, felt lower than herself because "it's not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He says, "Today, it has been real things that give me strength and strength to make me feel lower or feel different to me so far."
He said he wanted to prove that he was "something," and he didn't say anything when he learned about sexuality.
The two-time Olympic winner has turned into a high-level LGBT campaign and has made use of it to refer to many countries by decriminating homosexuality in the first Australian Games.
According to him, he said he was happy because he was able to live in a clear way and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013, said he loved a man named Lance Black - "I was surprised."
Daley said he was married to his 20-year-old Oskar, but he didn't have any problems with the age difference.
"When you live a lot at such young age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died after three years of age - he said it was hard to find someone living the same experience at the same age.
In June, her husband had a son named Robert Roy Black-Daley, and Daley told her that her whole perspective had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's because I have to win a gold medal."
"You know, there are things that are bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
"I'm the golden Olympics, Robbie."
His son was named the same year after he was diagnosed with a brain disease in 2011 and his father died at the age of 40.
Daley asked if he didn't accept his father's death and if one of the last things he wanted was getting tickets for London in 2012 - he wanted to be in front of him.
I couldn't say, "You're not here to come back."
"When he breathed, I kept him from his hand, and he continued until he actually breathed, and finally admitted that he was unrealized," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a win.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life – it wasn’t a better feeling to go in front of homeowners at the Olympics,” he said.
He was also inspired by the choice of the first song - I was proud of Heather Small, he was stunned with the Olympics and amazed everyone.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m. Monday.
Mickelson remained in the shade of a watch player in Kuboku on Saturday.
The 47th Ryder Cup game, which will be played by the American Phil Mickelson on Sunday, will be required to change the game's progress from the unpleasant return point to be released.
In a two-year-old race, Mickelson, who played to steal record 12 times, was included in the ranking of the player of the best matches between the matches by Captain Jim Furyk and taking from four.
As he often played in the United States, instead of being in the center of the race, he split into two places, working on the next game with the hope of being a friend of his day, and being a winner of five times.
Even at the top of his career, Le Golg National isn't the ideal age for the hard race paths that result in the 48-year-old short-sighted roads for the most honest competitors.
Although the process itself is quite terrifying, Mikelson's 9th game, which will be held on Sunday, will be confronted with Francesco Molineri, who is the open UK champion, and who is playing in a team with the new player Tommy Flitvudla, and the goal is to be won as much as three other games this week.
If Americans jump into the only 12 game that will be transferred to four games, Mikelson's game will be converted into a solvent game.
Furik expressed his belief in his player and noted that he couldn't say anything else.
"He realized his importance as a player today, relieved me, and told him that he would be ready in the morning," Furik added.
"He believes very much in himself.
He has a lot of money, and he has made a lot of money to the team this week.
I'm sure I couldn't imagine he played two games.
I thought I was looking for more, and that's the way we were looking for and we've got to do it.
He wants to be here, like everyone else."
Mikelson will update the records of most of the Ryder Cup games in the games held on Sunday.
He couldn't even update his own personal records, which could be the indicator of the end of Ryder Kuboku's career.
Mikelson had 18 wins, 20 defeats and 6 equality, but Furyk thought his existence had brought great success to the team.
"Furyk said, 'He's a funny, clever man, he understands the Chinese craft, he likes to enjoy people, and there was such a big thing in his team's room."
"I think, like this week, the young players are happy to talk to him, and it's very nice to see it.
He has more than just one player's contributions to a team."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great success will be shortly.
From the experience of European captain Thomas Bjorn, leadership in the Ryder Cup's last single games can be easily converted into a failure.
The Danish Tomas performed a debut at Varderrama in 1997, while a team led by Severyano Balesteros was ahead of five American teams, but a very small difference was 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You probably remember that our Valderrama had a large population; we had a large population in the Brooklyn and we won in the Valderrama, but Bjorn, who set a half clear after depicting the leader on the Gong on Sunday in his 2018 games, said: "Tomorrow comes to 5-3, and tomorrow Mill is 10-6."
The story will show me and everyone in this team that this isn't the last.
You're going to be very tired in the morning.
Get away from there and take the right steps.
This won't end until you get the indicator on the table.
We have a goal, we have gained this goal and focused on all our attention to this issue.
I said I'm focusing my entire attention on my 12 players, but we know very well who the side is - they're the best players in the world."
Bjorn, who remained satisfied with the successful performance of the players on this difficult course, added: "I couldn't walk away from myself in this game.
In the morning, the situation is even worse.
In the morning, we're going to get a new job, and this is our other job.
It's a wonderful feeling to be there when you're in the business rule, but if you're competing personally, you're all watching like a golf player.
This means that in the morning you have to compete with all players and show up your power.
And now you're going to get both the way, and you'll have to do what you can."
Unlike Bjorn, Cim Furyk will look for players with better activities as much as individuals as well. However, Cordan Spit and Castin Tomas, which gather three of the four branches, are the exceptions.
Furyk himself had been on both sides of the last day tournaments, and he was won in the games called "The Miracle at the Temple" in Europe, which were defeated from the race in Brussels.
In response to the questions about how to motivate the players of Ben Krenshou, Captain in 1999, to play the last day, he said: "I remember all that he said."
"We have 12 important competitions in the morning, but you have to move on with a quick start, as you see in Brooklyn and Madonna.
After this temp has fallen into work, it has great pressure on the median level games.
We've built our strategy in a proper manner, and we're encouraged by other young people to join our strategy, in the idea of creating a miracle in the morning."
Tomasa was led to the battle, and in the main game they met Europeans like Rori Mcllroy, Paul Kazey, Castin Rouz, Con Ram, Tommy Flitvud and La Poulter.
Bjorn said, "I have put my choices in this rule because I think that this method includes everything."
Germany's new military ships were re-entered.
According to the report of the local news agency, the newest ships of the German Navy Army in 2014 were planned to replace military ships from the Cold War era, but it would be at least due to the disadvantages and very expensive in this system.
According to a military statement in the Die Zeit newspaper, "Rheinland-Pfalz" - the new Baden-Württemberg-based military ship's leading brand sample was released until the first half of 2019.
These vessels had to be added to the army in 2014, and issues arising after the shipment had negatively impacted the request of this alleged project.
In 2007, four vessels of Baden Vürttemberg were ordered to replace the vessels from the ancient Bremen sink.
It is known that their main characteristics are the ability to defend against strong artilleria ball, air and water attacks, at the same time reducing radar infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long-term sustainability, for example, you can save the newest generation military ships out of port to two.
Die Zeit, who allowed Germany to carry out the power project on seas, noted that, however, constantly shows delays that modern military vessels have been elderly before use.
The German Army officially rejected the use of this ship and released many news about the failed F125 military ships returning to the Blohm &Voss event in Hamburg last year.
It was the first time that the ship returned to the ship after it was deported.
There was very little known about the reasons behind the conquest, but the German message noted that many important "software and apparatus supply defects" dropped the fighting vessel into a disadvantage when used in the battle mission.
The software was particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg's ships were managed by 120 vessel buildings - it was just half of the workforce in the former Bremen ships.
At the same time, it appeared that the ship was severely heavy, which reduces its work capacity and limits the future increases of the fleet.
The 7,000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" were believed to be double-weighted by the Germans during World War II.
From the supply of fixed apparatus, the price of the entire project – including the training of the project – also turned into a problem.
According to the report, from the first 2.2 billion euros, 3.1 billion dollars (3.6 billion dollars) were reached in Europe.
Germany's reduction in the power of the navy was more important when it comes to warnings on the newest freights.
At the beginning of the year, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, stated that the Navy "is actually consuming ships capable of deployment."
According to official information, this issue has expanded even more over time, because the old ships have gone out of use, but they have not been replaced with new ones.
He unfortunately noted that Baden-Wuerttemberg couldn't join any of the numbers.
The National Trust Organization is listening to the secret life of the founders.
The main purpose of a new study conducted in the mountainous areas of Scotland is to find out how the plants use the nature of their foodstuffs.
It is hoped that these findings will keep new light on the behavior of unlikely flying defects and will help their future protective activities.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Trust Organization of Scotland will include widespread children's breeds (soprano pipistrelles), at the same time, the long-term breeds of coffee and Daubenton's breeds in Wester Ross's Inverewe Gardens.
In order to monitor the activity of the creatures during the season, special sounding devices will be placed in the main locations around the property.
The National Social Service will conduct mobile research with hands-on detectors and employees.
The analysis of all the voters will determine the speed of the voters and what kind of voters they are doing.
Then we will create a map of living and account to create a broad sense of their behavior.
Rob Deuar, adviser on the protection of nature working at the National Test Service, hopes that he will also reveal the results, the most important areas for the breeds, and how they are used by each type.
The creation of this information will determine the benefits of the work of managing the natural area of living, such as the best way to preserve the beasts for the species, the beasts, and other related species.
The number of books in Scotland and the UK declined significantly as compared to the last century.
They are threatened by the enlargement of works that affect the rejection of landscapes, landscapes and habitats.
Smoking turbines and lighting can also cause risks such as some chemical products of smoking papers and construction materials, as well as attacks of pets.
There are no fears in fact.
However, in connection with their night breaks, it is more useful for their ears to keep their ears as long as they keep their eyes.
They use multidisciplinary eco-location technique to determine the place of obstacles and insects on the flight path.
The National Test Service, responsible for the observation of more than 270 historic, 38 important links and 76,000 hectares across the country, is very seriously involved in the work of the historical and historic.
He has 10 trained experts who are constantly conducting research, root checks and sometimes rescues.
The organization created the first and only special protection of Scotland in the Triv in the city of Dumfri and Qallouey, which owned eight of the ten species of Scotland.
Malikanna manager David Tompson notes that malikanna is the ideal area for them.
"We've got a great deal of interest here in the Tribute," he said.
"We have our old buildings, many old trees and a good place to live.
But there are a lot of things that are unknown about the benefits, so the things we see here and in other assets will help us understand more things that are needed to expand them.
He emphasizes that it is necessary to check the roots before the cleansing of the property, because the destruction of a single birth tunnel without knowing it can kill up to 400 women and young wounds, and maybe the entire local generation may be devastated.
It is lawful to protect and kill them, to worry, or to hurt them, or to destroy their bodies.
The Scottish Officer, Elizabeth Ferell, from the Living Guard Organization, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We have a lot to learn about our creations, and we don't know how many of our species are multiplied."
Ronaldo rejects the allegations of the assault and makes his representatives judge the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo said, "They want to introduce themselves," and deceived his allegations against him, such as "the news."
The German newspaper "Der Špigel" has been prosecuted by its officials.
In 2009, Portugal and Yuventus were accused of raping an American woman named Ketrin Mayorqa in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to "Der Spigel" on Friday, he paid to the woman $375,000 for keeping the event secret.
Following the release of the claims, Ronaldo, 33, said to 142 million followers of the claims that "live news."
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
"They're noting that they're saying today," said Ronaldo, who won Ballon d'Or five times.
"They want to use my name to introduce themselves.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but this is part of their work.
"I'm very happy and I'm very good," he added to the laughter.
According to Reuters, Ronaldon's representatives are preparing for the court for allegations that they call "the unpleasant account of doubts in the field of privacy."
Christian Schertz said the player, in recent years, maybe one of the most serious cases in the field of violation of personal rights, would require compensation in an appropriate amount to the level of this illegality.
The alleged event claimed that it took place in a set of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to Ronaldo and Mayorga, after they met at the night, they returned to the room where the players were exposed to an anal attack, as well as the documents filled with the Clarrk District Court in Nevada.
Majorga, after the alleged event, falling on Ronaldon's knees, leads to the fact that "99 percent" is a "good boy" and "one percent" is a mistake.
The film shows that Ronaldo's sex is in contact, but it's mutual.
In addition, Mayor and the police also argued that he had taken pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later because he was afraid of being exposed to "the revenge of the opposite side" and "the public dispute."
The 34-year-old woman said she would continue to live in a trauma due to the alleged event, and she said she would change her place.
Ronaldo was on the basis of the alleged assault from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this autumn passed through Yuventusa, where the Italian governments gathered a 100-euro income.
Brexit: The UK will be "excited" because it loses its car owners
After Brexit, the loss of a world leader in the automotive sector "will make Britain a great deal of money," Greg Clark said.
He continued: "This is related to saying that Toyota will leave the UK, the BBC, without getting any resolution, to stop the production in the nearby Burnaston factory," he said.
"We're going to have to get a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer noted that the impact of cross-border plants in the event of Brexit could be overwhelmed.
The Burnaston factory, Toyoto Auris and Avensis, has produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which has been exported to the remainder of the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll see that production is stopped in our factory," said Toyoto CEO Marvin Kuk in Brussels.
Other U.K. car manufacturers are afraid to leave the U.S. without finding out how the border trade would be, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW said, for example, that Brexitin would connect a monthly mini factory in Oxford.
The main concerns that car manufacturers have noted is that there are risks of supply supply at the event of Brexit.
Toyoton's production line is managed with a "seventh-time" field, and parts are shipped every 37 minutes both in the United Kingdom and from suppliers in the U.S..
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on March 29, it may cause disturbances that can lead to unconflict, as it is said in the industry on the surface.
It is unlikely to keep inventory in the Toyoto Derbishir factory more than one day worth, so the company noted that the production will also be stopped.
South Klark noted that Tereza Mein's plan for future relations with the EU has been fully calibred to stop these cheques on the surface."
"We need to get the chances. We want to see the best job to get the job, not just to win success, as I said, right now," said BBC Radio 4 in the program "Today."
"Not only from Toyota, but from other manufacturers is evidence that we are forced to continue something that consists of fully high-level supplies."
Although Toyota couldn't say how long the production would be stopped, it warned the long-term additional expenses would reduce the factory's competitive capacity and resulted in spending on work.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who worked in Burbnaston for 24 years, and is a factory's Union lawmaker, says the company's representatives are quite worried about a matter: "My experience is generally not coming back after these things have gone once again."
He said, "We have made a precise and reliable plan for our future relationships with the Mother."
According to the network's reports, Rosenstein and Tramp's views can be resumed.
According to reports on Tuesday, Donald Trump's chief prosecutor Rod Rozenstein's high-risk meeting with the Supreme Court representative Brett Kavanaf could "release a week after the fight."
Rosenstein monitors Russia's electoral intervention, relations between Trump and Russia and the potential barrier to justice by the president, the special adviser Robert Mueller.
If Trump's chief prosecutor failed to release his office and thus could threaten Mueller's independence, Washington has increased his codes for a few months.
In early this month, according to the New York Times, Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of taxing the device to take note of the Trampla talks and expel the president by way of 25th correction.
Rosenstein has denied this information.
But last Sunday, he went to the home of the network for the reason for his duty.
Meanwhile, a meeting with Trump in the United Nations in New York was announced on Friday evening.
Trump told Rosenstein not to "refuse" his job, but then Kavano and one of the women who committed him in sexually violent acts, Dr. Kristin Bleysi Ford, was a court hearing to dismiss a meeting with the Senate's court committee.
On Friday, Trump ordered the Senate to vote at the Senate's plenary session to investigate the FTB a week later.
Trump's news agency Sara Sanders was on Monday at the TV channel "Fox News".
Rosenstein said in an interview with the questionnaire, "The date for the show was not defined, and it could take place this week, but I could provide a weekly finish of the game, taking into account all other events that I am going to court.
It's time to show it, and I'm always glad to tell the message."
Some journalists don't agree with this idea: Sanders hasn't organized online brifings since September 10th.
Kris Uolles asked why.
Sanders noted that the lack of brifings came not from the "public game" antipathy, which added: "I will not focus on the idea that their tribes are."
He then proposed the development of a relationship between Trump and the report.
He added that "the president is taking more S&C sessions than he wanted before," "we're looking at those numbers."
Sanders stressed that brifings would continue in the previous rule again, but if the news has a chance to address some questions to the president of the United States, it's without saying that it's better to talk to me than to talk to me.
We're trying to do this often, and we're going to replace this news brifing in the last few weeks that we've been witnessing that we've been doing it again and that we're able to talk to the president of the United States in case it's possible to talk to the president of the United States."
Tramp as an agent answers questions at news conferences when he leaves the network or when he attends open sessions or when he comes out of the network.
Solo news conferences are rare in cases.
This week, the president in New York has probably pointed out why the collected journalists were sometimes free and sometimes strange.
The Ministry of Social Affairs in Scotland writes to EU partners in MSX about the Brexit plans
The Minister of Social Affairs has referred to the EU employees in Scotland to express gratitude to the state and to wish to stay there after Brexit.
Cin Friman MSP has sent less than six months before leaving the UK European Union.
The Scottish government has already charged the expenditure of EU citizens working on the status of their own state services.
Mrs. Friman wrote in his letter: "During the year, talks have continued about separation between the United Kingdom and the EU, which would result in the expected results.
However, the United Kingdom will strengthen its preparations if it is not possible for the United Kingdom to agree.
I know that this time is very funny for all of you.
For this reason, regardless of the nationality, I would like to point out to the extent to which the contribution of each member of the country is highly appreciated.
The U.S. and the members of the United States, which are outside of its healthcare services, benefit the people and the sick, which improve and strengthen our healthcare services, and the valuable experiences and skills that we provide.
The whole of Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christie Abercrombie was released after his death.
Michael Organ, a tennis player, reported that after taking immediate action in the game, he took off after he took off the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday 31-27, half defender of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Kristi Aberkrombi.
The chief trainer of the Tennessee state told reporters Rod Rid that he had been injured to leave the facility.
"It's closer to the sideline and it's thrown down there," Rid said.
In addition, trainers and medical professionals have given oxygen to Abercrombie on the side lines before they take it to the next stages.
The official of the state of Tennessee, Nashville, told Chris Harris, WSMV TV channel in Tennessee that it was not operational at Aberkrombi Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/degree of the plant yet," and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the plant is taken.
The second-learning student of the Red Village is in his first season after moving from Aberkrombi Illinois to Tennessee.
Before he left the game on Saturday, he had a total five attacks, which has reached the result of his season 18.
In the U.S., non-movable property habits will be acquired higher state funds than foreign buyers.
New plans based on Turin's homelessness, with extra money used for helping homelessness, will be acquired higher state funds than foreign buyers during unmovable property habits in the United Kingdom.
This step will neutralize the performance of the Corbin's young electorate.
The U.S. government will be charged with taxpayers in the United Kingdom.
For the purpose of helping homes, the company estimates to collect money up to £120 million a year.
Tereza Mey will today announce that with additional funds used for homeless aid, the UK will receive higher state funds than foreign buyers who have unmounted property in the UK.
This step will be appreciated as the goal of the Cerami Corbin to neutralize the performance of the community to meet young electors with the promises of ensuring more relative conditions.
With additional funds, the Government will be held by physical and legal persons who are paying taxes in the United Kingdom, which stimulates their efforts to combat homelessness.
Two years ago, the higher-level payments of second houses and houses delivered to the market, including higher-level payments, can be up to 3% of the additional payments that are added to the current state asset.
The company is expected to increase the cost of £120 million a year with this step.
According to calculations, 13 per cent of newly built London property is obtained by non-United Kingdom residents, which creates difficulties in the construction of food pills for the first time in the UK.
Most of the country's possible regions, especially the capital, most of its time spent outside the country, were converted to "cabin cities" due to the majority of foreign buyers spending outside the country.
A few weeks after Boris Consun's call for a reduction in the state's budget, many young people were invited to get their first homes.
He has committed sins in keeping high prices with unmovable assets using land-based construction companies, and has called on Ms. Meyi to resign from quotas to relative buildings in the United Kingdom with the purpose of correcting the "conventional structures" of the United Kingdom.
The South Korean government has announced a remarkable series of settlement councils, which are proposed to be excluded from the building and to be controlled by the courts, without any reason.
He also wants to have more powers to build new buildings.
Mrs. Mey said: "I told you last year that I'm going to give my prime minister's job to restore the wish of the British people - life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what we're going to do with the sharp market.
The UK will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work, and live here.
However, it is not right to say that those who don't live, as well as foreign-based companies, should have the same ease to have the same ease as to have the United Kingdom residents who are busy working.
The desire to have a homeless place for many people has been unreliable and the reduction of homeless people remains a poor reality."
C. Ross: "My main goal is to manage Scotland."
Chef of Andrelendin, Cek Ross, says that his "personal goal" is to be a Scotland manager at any stage.
The 42-year-old Scotland is now enjoying the creation of a Northeast club in the third quarter with three national privileges.
Last season, after returning St Mirreni to the Scottish Premier League, he moved to the "Light" Stadium this summer.
"I wanted to play as a footballer for my country.
I was given the B pocket, and that was true," Ross said at the Scottish Sportsound.
"When I was a kid, my father and I grew up in Hempden, and that's what I always heard.
But this opportunity will only be possible if I will be successful in the management of my club."
Sanderlendin's managers include Ross's winners Dik Advocate, Devid Moyes, Sem Allardays, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kin, Gasa Poyet and Paulo Di Kanio.
The former boss of the Alloa Atletics club, who was a member of Barnsli and Ipsviç Taun, reported that there was no sense of concern about the continuation of the resignation of such famous names in such a large club.
"I'm going to be grateful that I'm going to be able to get this club back to Premyer Liga.
He stated that, based on the structure and possibilities in this club, he is unconditionally applicable to Liga Premyer."
"It's not easy to get to that level, but I'm sure I can only think of myself as well as I can get back to that club."
After being a boss assistant in Dambarto, and after 15 months at the Hearts' coachship, he started his career.
Then, after he was defeated by the Alloa club until the third level, he helped them rise again, and in the next season he rose to the level of the championship victory from the defeat of St. Mirreni.
And Ross notes that he now feels more comfortable than his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical clubs.
When he said, "I think it's a good idea," he said, "it's a good idea."
"I thought it was the right choice for me to manage more than toys.
It sounds weird, because I've done it well, I've earned it well, and I've benefited from some logical advantages.
But toys can be difficult.
There are many things you need to do on the basis of the week.
I'm still living with it in terms of stress and stress, but I feel more free.
I've always wanted to manage it, and now I'm trained with it, this is the moment I've felt the most comfortable during my entire lifetime."

The impact of air and main social and sports events from home remains the biggest factors.
Despite the continued price pressures due to the annual calculation of sales by 4.8% will be even more painful, it is not surprising that the group of restaurants continues to fight.
The long-term warm spring food operators couldn't come in the worst time, and it will show that the more moisture temperature we observed in August will ensure that this is the most important facility."

The online advertising of the cameras that compare their mothers with injectors creates a difference of ideas.
Comparison of the company's mothers producing the apparatus, the Internet advertising has differentiated the ideas of online advertising.
"The world's first silently dressed apparatus," said Elvie, who is trained by the manufacturer of use technology, is an ironic video advertising burrica in showing the freedom of the new apparatus to improve when the mothers of the use technology are trained to promote the new apparatus.
The four true mother of the songs in the earliest songs are the words: "Well, I trust myself, but you won't see a building," and "If you don't see it, it's not like it, it's my dogs."
"I will feed my children, I will feed my children, I will cleanse my children, I will cleanse my children."
However, the company's Facebook page has caused changes in the online advertising site.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, video viewers have not been met together, even the majority noted that this milk industry illuminates the "spirits."
"It's a very unconventional decision to advertise this product by using foods.
One person wrote that they should be pregnant and be born, just like us, but unlike us, their children are taken from their hands a few days after the birth of them."
Elvie's invisible apparatus is located in the invisible mother's bustkeller (Elvie/Ana)
Another said, "Mom, it's clear that it's traumatic for the child, too.
Why shouldn't they be used in the advertisement for mothers who continue to feed their child with mother's milk?"
Another person added: "This is a way away from reality."
A woman said she thought she'd be "deceived," and others had the right to make her publicity.
"I think that's a simple idea.
If I were still feeding it, I would have found someone.
Healing the device made me feel the same way.
It's a little bit funny, but I think it's like it's me.
Someone wrote that this is a product."
Another commented: "This is an advertisement for mothers who feel like "eternal" (often at workplaces and toilets) and who feel like "eternal").
This is not an advertisement that promotes the milk industry or promotes it."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that all of them were invisible to the work of their survivors.
The concept of the campaign is based on the idea that most of the women who are deaf are feeling self-esteem.
However, the Elvie Südgadan apparatus is completely soundless, there are no symbols and pipes, and is located in a non-visible manner for mothers who give milk, giving freedom to move their children, even keeping their milk and walking.
Ana Balarin, a member of the BK's partner and mother organization, said: "Elvie Südsağan's apparatus is a product that is worthy of a powerful and provocation offering.
While taking into account the parallelity between the women injectors in Südveren, we wanted to heal milk and illuminate all its difficulties, at the same time showing the incredible feeling of freedom that the new apparatus will look good and close to the heart.
This isn't the first time that the Elvie Südband applies to the news headlines.
During London Fashion Week, two children's mother-in-law designer Marta Jakobovskiy was shown in the podium during the use of the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to tentfalls on the Texas border.
Despite the fact that the number of migrants that have passed over a month has remained unchanged, the number of migrants has remained unchanged, the number of migrants that have been deployed with hard rhetoric and political sponsors.
As a rule, most of the sponsors were themselves and took steps forward, demanding children, fearing to threaten their chances of staying in their country.
In June, the potential federal government sponsors and their family members have to submit bargain tracks and the risk of sharing this information with officials on immigration has increased.
Last week, the senior executive officer of the Immigration and Immigration Service, Metyu Olbens, confirmed before Congress that the agency had arrested individuals who were dealing with them with the purpose of being sponsored by those who did not reach an unexpected age.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the detained were not sentenced beforehand.
Sponsors or nearly 80% of their family members have been dismissed in the country and are criminal criminals.
He said that we are continuing to follow these people.
Officers are trying to deploy the child's settlement process, not 60 days after some of the detained as before, according to asylum workers' information, applying new rules that require them to avoid trial within a month of detention.
Most of them will be made to the judges in front of the immigration work, not personally, but through a video conference to make claims about their legal status.
Those who are deemed not to have the right to request aid will be deported in the form of assault.
According to the words of asylum seekers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children survive in court, the more likely they are to be in an attractive and low condition, which can lead to forced explosions and imprisonment defeats.
The photographers noted that the child's struggle with such problems increases in the situations that are more intense than Tornilo, which are experiencing the size of the continent.
They added that the trauma that many already have led to fighting children can deepen even more because of the time they don't give them to emotional preparations and friends when they are sitting in the tent.

He told the participants of the Assembly that "they must immediately and unconditionally escape from our lands."
The Muslim said that 300,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011 and millions of people have left their homes, "that is, war with terrorism has ended."

There are more than 1,000 soldiers in France in the lands of the war.
Muhammed said that the conditions for their return were good and that he had sinned in the "irrational spread of fear" which forced some Western refugees to stay in their country.
"We are calling for help to our international public and humanitarian organizations to bring refugees back," he said.
"It's just a matter of humanity that they're politics."

The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack on the region where three million Syrians live, supported by Russia.
However, Mualim emphasized that the agreement was "accurate date" and that military operations hoped to fight fighters and fighters related to Al-Qaeda, and that they would be "destroyed."
The UN diplomatic representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that they will call on the first meetings of the new committee, which will soon include government and immigration, to prepare the after-military operations for Syria and lead the right to the elections.
The Syrian government has unveiled its conditions for participation in the committee and said the work of the Commission should be restricted by "the review of the provisions of the existing constitution" and has warned the intervention.

The money from abroad is the most stressful result of the next election.
It is not surprising that the 17th role of Pennsylvania has been exposed to the re-organization of the financial flow of issues in the Congress for the same place, which the two parties have been fighting for the same place.
This is the role of the newly drawn Pittsburgh Environmental Representative of Democrats, against Konor Lemb, who won on other topics in the next summer elections.
Lemb is currently struggling against the Republican Kit Rotfusa, who represents the 12th-year-old Pennsylvania, which appears violently with the new 17th role.
In January, the Federal Court of Pennsylvania declared that the old rules were not in accordance with the Constitution, and the maps were resumed after the Republicans were counted on behalf of the Republicans.
The financial frameworks of the main parties for the financing of the race campaign on 17th issue led to a financial struggle between the Congress Committee of the Democrats Party (DPKK) and the National Committee of the Republicans Party (RPMK).
Lemb was recognized as the winner in the next elections held on March 18th in Pennsylvania.
For more than ten years, this role has been in the Republican office, and President Donald Trump will win in the city with 20 branches.
Political experts have given a great advantage to the Democrats.

The diplomats pointed out that they have already met Beijing with the awesome pressure of Washington.
In June 2017, the President of Panama, Xuan Karlos Varela, had a sincere meeting and the partners were there to expose the Trump Organization's administrative story.
At the beginning of this month, the Department's news reporter, Hizer Nauert, said that officials of the State Department had decided to call back the leaders of the US diplomatic mission in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to recognize Taiwan."
In 2017, however, sanctions were based on Salvador, including $140 million, including drug abuse, development and economic support.
The sanctions offered in the visa issuance, including reducing targeted restrictions and financial assistance, would be difficult for the Central American country and its high-level unemployment and crime.
Based on the project of internal meetings, North America and Central America officials attended a high-level conference dedicated to economic development and security that immigrants were challenged to prevent the immigration of the United States in a year's defeat.
In mid-September, however, the high-level officials of the administration clearly stated that they would like to implement the conference by suspending the application of sanctions against Salvador.
According to diplomats, at the conference planned in mid-October, Vice-President Mayk Pensin was appointed to address the identification of administrative tasks.
And three American ambassadors from Washington returned quietly to the Republic of Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without a new, hard news distance and sanctions.
Mr Bolton has refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to continue internal discussions under the condition of the protection of privacy.

The next step is the report of Robert Mül, a special observer on the possibilities of obstacleing Trump's justice in the public information that is now very important.

The history runs around such a period of time, and the unsafe march of democracy is overwhelmed or overwhelmed.
The Americans are now meeting a few of these points.
If the person who is responsible for the investigation of the Tramp is responsible – what should we do if we differ from the position of the chief prosecutor Rod Rozenstein?
In the last year's newspaper, Rosenstein's secretly suggesting the president's listening and thinking that it's useful for his presidential post, he's ahead of him after the release of information.
The "The Times" isn't right.
"If the newly requested FTB for Bret Kavano is not entirely or fair or sexual compulsion and false accusations are convincing, how will we react to it in the Ali Court?
And, most importantly, are we going to vote in the next way on the congress that will be responsible for the Trump?

Maybe we could do this at the end of the game, but I don't think it was a fair result.
It may be that they were better in the first part, and we were better in the second part by showing better results.
On Friday night, this is another big night in Europe.
I hope that we can win three games, but this will be a difficult game, so that the competition has shown good results in the last games, but I'm sure, taking into account the mass that supports us, we can get rid of and musical results.
It was very difficult for me to take into account the changes in my club and the changes in it last year, but now there's a natural factor to win a degree.
There's a good game and the players are enjoying it, and the training is good.
I hope we'll be on the back of the last season and we'll be successful."

In January 2016, the family force against him was charged with weapons storage materials in connection with the incident and the report on family force against him.
The girl claimed that she had shot him.
In 2016, Sarah Peylin's veterans were denied by the group because of her child's post-traumatic stress disturbance in Iraq.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of people who have been in need.
On Friday, at least 384 people were required as a result of a call on the island of Sulava, Indonesia.
It has caused sunamia in 7.5 honey power and has scattered thousands of homes.
The number of deaths in recent days is expected to increase in the number of electricity and rabbit lines cut.
It is close to the center of the Sulave, located in the capital of Indonesia from the north-east of Cakarta.
There are videos on social media that are in the opposite direction.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu.
The federal prosecutor in New York is looking for a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist act.
The Federal Prosecutor's death resulting from eight people in New York's terrorist act is suspected of a death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, who is known as the state's death sentence, which has not been applied for federal crimes since 1953.
According to the 30-year-old Saipoz, in October, he used his truck to sell it from the "Home Depot" company to trace markets and bicycles along the West Sayd road in Lower Manhatt.
The prosecutors have to prove that the victims of eight people have been killed "deceased" and "deceased" by "deceased" according to the death penalty requirement in the state of New York City.
According to the court's document, the two possible charges contain the death penalty.
After the attack, the federal great jury issued a 22-second charge on Saipov. This judgment, as a result of the federal prosecutors, is also the purpose of helping the offence that is used by the federal prosecutors in special crimes.
The prosecutors said, describing the practice of Cyprus as "manufactured, inconsistent and unconventional," they require significant planning and preparation of the attack.
"Sayfullo Habibullayevich Saipov Dieqo Enrike Ancelini, Nikolas Kleves, Ann-Lure Dekat, Darren Dreyk, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruci, Hernan Dieqo Mendoza and Alexandro Damian Panyukkon's family and friends has caused harm, injury and violence."
The victims are five tourists from Argentina.
It has passed 10 years from the last trial in New York's Southern Court of Death.
He was accused of killing two drug suppliers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last held in New York in 1953 for the married couple Julius and Etel Rozenbergs. This couple, two years before that time, was accused of undermining the Soviet Union for a hidden purpose during the Cold War.
Both of the Rosenbergs were conducted by electric chairs on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documents, there was no regret in the days and months following the attack of Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan.
The police said he didn't feel bad about his actions.
According to the accused, Saipov told the official authorities that after watching ISIS's videos on his phone, he was excited to carry out the attack.
According to the police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in the hospital room.
He admitted that he was an accusation based on the 22th anniversary.
One of the federal public defenders representing Saipovu said he had heard publicly blamelessly according to the court's decision by David Petton.
"If our idea does not accept the sentence of life imprisonment without being allowed to leave freedom, the decision to apply the death penalty will simply extend the trauma of these events to anyone who is affected," Petton said.
The defence court asked the prosecutors not to apply the death penalty before.
Tori said that Brexit talks should be responsible for NAYCEL FARAJ.
Today, Naycel Faraj Tori has promised "to visit the former army."
The U.S. Independence Party's strong leader said politicians should feel pressure from the European Skeptics - because Tereza Mein said one of his parliamentary members should be appointed as a person in the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Boun Boun, a member of the Protectors Party, said that if he had been a Southern Faraj Brexit officer, the United Kingdom would have gone out until now.
However, the tragedy that came into being in the process of establishing an agreement between the deep of May was particularly emphasized by Tori, who were also the remaining parties to Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep a compromise plan between Brexit partners, Alihtars and the EU attacks.
In spite of the opposite reaction, the protesters said they would continue their efforts to make an election between the Europeans and the Leyborist Party and the "xaos" package.
Boun Solihal said he wants to go out of the cheekers in the myth "Wake up is to be separated."
He proposed that Pharaoh should be appointed lord and that he should be devoted to formal talks with Brussels.
"If he had been a man, we would have gone out so far," he said.
He added: "I'm going to support Brazil, but we're going to have to leave Chekers."
He said, "We haven't shot in the world wars to make a defeat.
We want to create our own laws in our country."
After the 2016 election, Boun did not accept that public opinion changes: "The idea of changing the idea of the British people and wanting to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
The Brexit partner Andrea Cenkins, who was on his way, said to reporters: "I just say this: the Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There's no rage between the people, there's no rage between the people, there's no rage between the people, there's no rage between the people, and there's no rage between the people who walk in the streets, first of all our activities, and even between the party.
Let's start listening to people and listening to them."
He added: "When the prime ministers keep their promises, they will remain in their duties."
Faraj said that if politicians who participated in the referendum were allowed to make a decision that was taken during the 2016 referendum, they should feel pressured.
“This has already become a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political symposium,” he said.
"They're trying to make Brexit clear, and today we're here to say that we won't allow them to remain unpunished because you're doing this."
He added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political symphony on which you're going to make a speech.
We are visiting the nation's army of this country who wins Brexit, and we will not stand up until the defeat of the United Kingdom becomes independent, self-governmental, defeated."
At the same time, Brexit leaders walked in Birmingham before spending two hours of lunch in the center of the city.
After the end of the week, a group of activities voted for "Toriers Against Brexit."
Lord Adonis, the Leyborist's talks, put the defenders in charge of the security issues that the party has experienced with the application of the party.
"They are people who are able to implement all technology and IT systems in an efficient manner in "Canada plus" in Ireland, an unwarranted boundary, free trade without dispute," he added.
"That's a total distortion.
“There is nothing else until Brexit,” he said.
U.R.P. plans to "reflect" the presidency's appointment.
The U.S. Senate, Elizabeth U.S., said that after the elections were held in November, the presidency's appointment would be held in detail.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democratic from Massachusetts on Saturday talked about the future of the meeting at the Serbian Massachusetts building.
President Donald Trump's representative, Uorren, who frequently introduced Trump's election campaign in 2016 in the Massachusetts, resumes his nomination against Ceff Dilla in November.
He is at the center of the events that will be able to win Trump in 2020.
The event held in Holyok on Saturday was the 36th meeting that Trump met with the electorates on the basis of the building's shape after being elected president.
One of the participants asked if he had planned or planned to take his appointment to the Presidency.
In response, Warren reported that it is time for women's defensive government to go to Washington, and that there is also a woman who is in high position.
The LSU player Simsin was arrested as a result of the murder of a woman with a gun
On Saturday, Baton Ruj police told Louisiana that a suspect was arrested as a result of the murder of Ueyd Simsin, the LSU basketball team's player.
The 20-year-old Deyton Simpson was kept at the news conference at 11:00 p.m.
They asked for help to determine the identity of the person who fell to the camera by spreading the video of the armed attack on Friday.
The 20-year-old Sims was killed by gunshot near the South University in the morning.
"Ueyd Sims was injured with a smile and died as a result," police officer Murfi C. Pol said on Saturday.
Ueyd was confused with the issue to defend his friend and Simpson laughed at him.
Simpson was arrested and admitted that he was in the place of a gun event, Ueyd Sims has fired.
Simpson was arrested without an accident and was controlled by the police officer of the East Baton Ruj House.
The young Sims, who grew at 6 feet (1.98 meters) in Baton Rujda, played 32 games 10 times in the last season, and earned an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 pounds and 2.9 rikoots in each game.
Russia's Qran Prize: After the team's tactics helped win Sebastyan Fette, Lyuis Hemilton approaches the world championship
On Saturday, when Valtteri Bottasin was released before Lyuis Hemilton, it became clear that the team's tactics will play a major role in the competition.
Bottas took a good start from the shop, and it can be said that Hemilton was very behind, so he protected his position in the first two cycles and caused Fettelin to pass the attack on his teammate.
Fettel first entered the pit-stop and allowed Hemilton to go at the end of the trail, which had to be a solvent element.
"Mercedes" then also hit a round and came back to Fettelin, but Hemilton, "Ferrari" followed the risk of continuing to keep the driver's third day, not asking to leave, after many close movement maneuvers.
Max Ferstappen started at the back of the start line and was at the seventh end of the first round on the 21-year-old day.
Later, he went forward with a large portion of the race, because he took a quick finish of the turtles and kept Kimi Reykkonne in fourth place to pass.
In the end, he arrived at the 44th time, but he didn't get rid of his speed in the remaining eight times because he was at the 4th time.
It's a hard day, because Valtter had done a good job all week and was one of the real ways to let me go.
"The team has done a lot of work to have two figures," Hemilton said.
It's really a very bad language.
President Donald Trump, in a statement held on Saturday, called Kristin Bleyzi to the Al-Ford's Supreme Court, immediately rejected Senator Dayan Faynshyn, for saying that he did not dismiss the letter accusing Brett Head of Court in sexual imprisonment.
The President, who spoke in the myth held in Western Virginia, did not address the statement of the Senate's Court Committee, but said that people who were taking place in the Senate were nobody, deceitful, and liar.
"You've seen a good thing that can happen in the Senate in the last few days, and you've seen a good thing that continues, anger, anger, wrath, namerrd, deceit, and liars," he said.
"If you're looking at the information that's outdated and outdated, then I didn't do it.
"I didn't do that."
Is it in your mind?
You're still in love, aren't you in love?
The answer is in my footsteps... are you scratching the document?
No, no.
I didn't distort it.
Well, wait a minute.
"We're not, we're not, we're not, we're not," he added.
In July, Ford's charges against Kavanaugh were sent to Faynştan, which was dismissed in early September, but denied that Faynştan's dismissed information came from his office.
The Hill reports that Faynştan's committee said: "I haven't hid Dr. Ford's charges, I haven't denounced her issue."
"He asked me to keep this secret, and I kept the case secret as he wanted it."
However, his accusations seem to have been unpleasant to the President, and the President told him at the meeting on Friday night: "I'd like to tell you what really is a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst part of my body I've seen."
The President, who has been accused of sexual abuses by three women and who continues to defend against the Ali Court, claims that Democrats use these charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the powers they need.
You can see bitterness, fraud, such as they have suffered, the power, and the authority, it's not interesting for them as they have suffered," the "Mediaite" site wrote in the words of the President.
Elite Liga: "The Dandy Wolfs" 5-3 "The Belfast Rivers"
Patrik Prayayer shot two hands in the game against "Dandi"
The "Dandi Ulduz" won the match on Saturday in Denmark with a 5-3 account, instead of the game that Elite was fighting against the "Belfast Rivers" in the Liga on Saturday.
The "Girls" have won the advantage of a man with two hands in the game with the wipes of Patrik Praeyer and Francis Bovilyen.
Prior to recovering the advantage of the "Nouns," Mayk Sullivan and Cordan Kauni's homeowner team arrived at the level.

Hundreds of people on the plane were killed to ensure that people were rescued.
Once an airplane expert in Indonesia has been destroyed, he has been presented as a hero when he ensures that hundreds of people carry a plane on the ground safely.
On Friday, more than 800 people died after a powerful call on the island of Sulashi and exiled tsunami.
After the earthquake, the strong disaster continues to cause problems in the garden, and many people remained connected under the mountains in the city of Palu.
Unlike those who escaped to save their lives, Entoni Qunavan Aqunq Palu, a 21-year-old, did not leave his place in a terrifying contest at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He didn't take place to ensure that the airplane "Batik Air-6321" on the plane at the same time was safely flying.
Then he jumped down there, thinking that the contestant was split.
He later died in the hospital.
The Australian ABC News channel's office, Johannes Sirat, reporter of the Indonesian Air Aviation Service, reported that the decision could have rescued hundreds of people.
We built a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost the helicopter this morning before arriving in the palace.
"We're very sad to hear about this," he added.
At the same time, officials are afraid that by saying the country's reduction in the risks of offences, the agency could limit entry into cities of Donklag, Siqi and Buton, the officials are afraid to reach a number of thousands of deaths.
"While most bodies have not been found, because most of them are still under destruction, it is believed that the death rate will still rise," reporting agent Sutopo Purvo Nuqroho said.
Waves up to six meters have destroyed the Hall that will be held on Sunday's mass deep season.
Military and proprietary aircraft provide assistance and support.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told the Sky News channel: "The car of medical assistance brings crashes every minute.
It's hard to find clean water.
They've found mini markets everywhere."
Yan Qelfand, head of the office of the International Red Cross Society in Indonesia, told CNN channel: "The Red Cross Society in Indonesia is trying to help the leftovers, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a face, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Coko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Tuesday and said to the country's army: "I ask you to work night and day to complete any requests related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
In the beginning of this year, more than 550 people have been killed in Lombok as a result of the calls that occurred in Indonesia.
Micronesia's airplane crash: Now he says a man has fallen down after the airplane crash in the airplane lake "Air Niugini"
After the airline that manages an airplane accident in the Pacific Ocean lake in Micronesia, said that all of the 47 passengers and the aircraft had been safely evacuated from the plane, a human being has now fallen.
The Air Niugini publisher said that the person relying on the day of the day was unable to determine the location and situation of the person who was relying on the day of the day.
The company reported that it worked with locals, hospitals and researchers to find that person.
The company did not immediately answer questions about its age or nationality.
The local vessels tried to enter the aircraft's Truck Island airport after falling into the water, helped rescue other ships and ships.
On Friday, the officials said that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said 6 stars stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were stable.
It's still unclear why accidents and incidents have occurred.
The company and the U.S. Army Navy reported that the airplane had been flying outside the airline.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had been flying.
The U.S. police officer Bill Ceynz said the plane was very downstairs.
“It’s very good,” Ceynz said.
According to Ceynzin, he and the others were able to move in such a way in the water as he and the others were to be baptized.
He said that the people on the plane were encouraged to get rid of their heads and to get rid of their heads.
The U.S. Army Navy's nearby maritime sailors helped to rescue people from ships to sail before they landed to the depth of about 100 feet (30 meters) of water.

When the woman was burned up, she was ready for a night's death.
On Saturday, the prosecutor initiated a woman from Mississippi in 2014 to re-examine the work of a person accused of prosecution.
Pol Roulet, an investigator of the U.S. Department of Justice, has expressed himself in hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation of the discovery information.
He explained to the jury how Queenton Tellis, a 29-year-old, and the 19-year-old victim, Cesika Circle, used his cell phone letters to gather his death at night.
According to The Clarion Ledger's newspaper Roulette, he received information from several mobile phones showing that Circle died with him at night, and where they were, and that is what Tellis' earlier claims.
The information received showed that his cell phone was in a place with the Circle phone – he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time – and the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford said he wasn't in the city on Saturday.
When the prosecutors questioned that Tellis said that night that he was in Sanford's car, Sanford said that he was lying, he said that the car was in Nesville.
Another inconvenience was that Tellis said that he met Circle about two weeks ago during his death.
The mobile phone records showed that they had been met just a week ago.
According to roulette, a while after Circle's death, Tellis deletes his messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the girl from his life," Heyl said.
It is planned to start the defence policy on Sunday.
The judge said that the jury would be sent to the jury at the end of that day.

New York City's president is sentenced to court for his wife's release from work after a "release" message
The New Yorker, after receiving the wrong-oriented message from his mother who complained that he was "a different blackmailer," sent his wife to the court because he was freed from work for a separate choice.
As a result, the couple are convinced that they are indigenous as they are.
Linsi Plasko-Flaksman, a two-child mother-in-law, was encouraged to learn that she was black on the first day of Jizel Morisin's first working day in 2016.
"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending this message to Mrs. Moris, she sent it twice.
According to the New York Post, after the mistake, Plasko-Flaksman released Morisi from the job, saying that he didn't see the work of their African-American originals who left their job well, and that he was waiting for someone in the Philippines instead.
Morisis had the right to work a day and called for a taxi to Uber home.
Now Moris, due to his release from the job, makes his marriage courts and requires $350 compensation every day, as previously held, but uncontracted, to stay in the workplace.
He said in his press interview on Thursday: "I want to show them that you don't do such things. I know that this is a separate choice."
The couple, fearing that they would not be able to rely on him, said that the end of Morisin's work was an appropriate step, saying that they were irrational.
"He sent a message that he didn't want to say.
He's not an Irish.
"We're not Irish people," Coel Plasko said.
"But if you're wrong, would you give your children into the hands of someone you're treating?"
Your newborn baby?
It's good."
As the Plasco claims, "Sanity," he said that the wife only brought a child to the world two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Do you want to pursue such a person?"
This isn't a very happy step," the investor said.
Although the court continues to work, the public judgment immediately denounced their partner's behaviour and reasoning on social networks.
The new letter reveals that "Paddinqton" writers were afraid that the readers couldn't understand the word of the moon.
Bondun, the girl who came to the world, Karen Yankel, said: "It is hard to imagine someone in a place that reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It's very nice to understand what we know about the great success of "Paddinqton" now."
The girl who said she could be optimistic about the unacceptance of her father's work as a cinema operator on the BBC channel before she was inspired to write a child's book with a small toy moon, wrote that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was sadly confused after she died last year.
Karen, who talked about Paddinqton, said she was very proud of her father's last success.
"He was a very quiet man and he wasn't in the camp.
But because "Paddinqton" is very real for him, that means, it was something like having a child of an old man who has something: even if there is no truth, you will be proud of him.
I think he has seen the success of "Padinqton" in this way.
This is a matter of fact, and it is a matter of fact, but it is always a matter of self-respect."
I'm going to tell her that she's dead, and I'm going to tell her that she's on the phone.
When he arrived on the ground, his daughter was promptly taken to Nizza's Louis Paster 2 hospital, where doctors tried to save her life forever on the ground.
"Nad often called to say that it's really a bad thing to expect him to do so," said Ednan-Laperuza.
"Later, Nad called me to tell me that he would die in the next two minutes, and I had to thank him."
I did it.
I said, "I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs given to her to keep her heart attacking will slowly disappear and leave her body.
He died for a while before, and everything came to an end.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to know all this was happening.
I was in such a situation that I couldn't do anything in the eyes of my family or my family, either in the morning or in the morning.
All of these feelings have to be completely shattered.”
As Mrs. Ednan-Laperuza, who has lost her daughter so far, has forgotten this difficult trial that he has gone through, even though he is trying to fly alongside other forces.
He said, "No one knew.
I had to shake my head down and my eyes stopped.
It's hard to explain this, but I felt that when I was on the plane, I felt like I was on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her daughter.”
Females are trying to get rid of suicide.
Two women who lose their love as a result of suicide are trying to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sheron Deyvis and Keli Hamfriys have put in the Uels Tower the open phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Deycis's son, Thailer, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want another parent to feel what I'm feeling every day," she said.
Mrs. Deyvis, a 45-year-old in Lily, said he was a brilliant overwhelming over the future of his son's laughter.
"Everyone knew him for his laughter.
They always said that his smile was the room that he wanted.”
But he left work before his death, because he was really in a place of darkness.
In 2014, he was a 11-year-old brother who found him after he murdered himself.
Mrs. Deyvis said, "I'm always worried about the impact of this."
Mrs. Deyvis made these statements so that people who can go around and can talk about it – it's a friend like that – could know they are.
“Don’t sit quietly – you need to consult.”
Mrs. Hamfriys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Deyvis for years, resigned shortly after his 15-year-old mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt bad, sad, or how he felt," she said.
"We saw a change in his situation two days ago from the holiday.
On Christmas Day, he was underneath the circle – when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them or anything else.”
Hamfriys said that this death was a great trauma for them, but they should come from this passage: "This destroys the family.
That's a shame to us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

The FTB is in danger of the future of Brett Kavan
"I thought that if we had achieved something as he really wanted – when the desire to be carried out in a limited form from a quantity point of view – we could, perhaps less, create unity," she said, noting that on Saturday, Fleck was unable to protect the rooted parties.
Why did Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FTB to resign?
The reason for their inadequacy is not completely timed.
The interim elections that will take place on November 6 will only take five weeks - if the situation of the Republicans is as bad as expected, they will seriously weaken in their efforts to ensure the country's highest court is elected.
Corc U. opened the phone to call the Ice Senators, and talked to them to support the Cavanate that works for Ice at the Network and, through it, meets his partner Eshli, who is a personal partner.
What's going on after preparing the FTB?
At the moment, 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the Senate.
It is still unclear that Vice-President Mayk Pensin will not gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow him to infringe equality and confirm his leadership to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea is "defeated" under the rule of the
South Korean politician said the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined after Kim Chen Ian came into power seven years ago.
Park Byonq-seuq said, according to the information obtained from the South Korean ministry of unification, that in 2011, compared to 2706 people, 1127 people fled from the country last year.
According to the park, the severity of the border control between North Korea and China and the high prices imposed by human refugees are the main attributes.
The officials did not make any clear comments on the issue of Pxenyan.
Most of the South Koreans escaped from the northern part of the country.
Seoul officially reports that more than 30 thousand North Koreans have crossed the border illegal since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people cross the Armed Forces Zone (HZ) that is seriously defended between two Koreans and cross China, which is the longest border with North Korea.
China isn't a refugee, it's an unlawful refugee, and most of them are forced to return to their own countries.
The relations between the North and the South – technically still in war – have improved significantly in recent months.
In the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pxenya to discuss issues that were rooted in negotiations about the destruction of nuclear weapons.
This took place in Singapore in June after a large-scale meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Con In took place in Singapore to work on the target of denial of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yonq-ho said that there were sanctions imposed by the U.S. because of the lack of progress since then.
"We will not be able to rely on our national security without any reliance on the U.S., and in such circumstances, on the contrary, we will not put our weapons first," Ri said in a statement at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
She calls the "hysterical" sheet, saying she isn't fit to serve in the court
The minority leader in the palace called Brett Kavanu "sterik" who was appointed to the Supreme Court, and said that it was not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi reported these ideas on Saturday in the Texas Tribunal Festival, which was held in Ostin, Texas.
"If a woman had ever acted like this, they would say she was willing — I didn't know that thought from my brain," Pelosi said on Thursday about the relationship that the Senate spoke to the Court Committee.
Kavano, when they were teenagers, accused Kristin Bleyzi of sexual assault in Forda emotionally.
Kavano was very emotionally speaking during the opening statement, sometimes it means that he talked excitedly about wintering and his family, while he was reading in the school for years.
He also denounced the Democrats in the committee's allegations for Hillari Klinton's 2016 presidential elections, calling the Democrats a "great and linked crime" organized by the enraged liberals.
Pelosi said Kavanah's statement was proven to be unable to serve in the Ali Court, because this proved that he was contrary to Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself by means of these statements and by means of the way of the Clintons, the Democrats," he said.
In case the vote was confirmed and the majority of Democrats received in the House of Non-Democracies, when Kawanu was committed to prosecuting before the court, Pelosi questioned whether he would not be injured.
"I'm going to say this - if he tells Congress and FTB the truth, then it's not appropriate to stand in such a case as to be in the Ali Court, no matter what is in the present case," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Justice.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is very worried about the potential courts against the "Rou, Island" Act, or the Cavan's Prosecution Act, because he is considered to be a protective judge.
In the hearings of confirmation, Kavano issued an answer to the questions regarding whether the Court would cancel certain decisions or not.
"It isn't time for a poor man to go to court and to say, 'Isn't it good for us?'" Pelosi said.
Women should use it.
It's a good idea that the anger that has been swallowed for months and years is unable to get it out of the soul without crying.
"We're crying in anger," Mrs. Staynem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a bad thing, isn't it?"
She continued: "A woman who worked in a job of executioner in a field helped me very much. She also told me she was crying when she was angry, but she created a way. So when she began to cry and cry, she thought, "I could feel sad because I could cry.
But I'm angry."
And then he just kept on talking.
And I thought it was good.”
The age of eyes is permitted, shortly, as an outbreak of anger, because it is basically misunderstood.
In my first place of work – one of the memories in my most steps in the men’s office – when I was crying angry at a time that would not be expressed, an elderly woman – a little cold manager I’ve always been afraid of – was to push me down the sticks from my neck.
"Never let them see you crying.
They don't know you're angry.
They will think that you are sad and will be satisfied, because they are angry with you."
Patrisia Shroyder, the Democratic Congressman from Colorado, then worked with Qery Hart as president.
In 1987, when Hart was deported from a "Monkey Business" vessel in a neighborhood relationship and retreated his appointment, Schroyder was deprived of great dreams and thought that he had no reason to investigate the idea of conducting his appointment within the presidency.
"This wasn't a good enough planned decision.
There were also seven other candidates in the Presidency race, and it was the last thing they needed to have an additional person.
Someone called it "Your Sister and Seven Arrows" - he laughed at me 30 years later.
Because it was late for the campaign, it was back to collect money, so he promised he wouldn't enter the race until he collected $2 million.
This was a struggle that couldn't win.
He realized that some of the supporters who gave him $1000 would give him only $250.
"Do you think they're going to get me?" she wondered.
When he announced that he could not start the official campaign, his feelings – the gratitude to people who supported him, the collection of money and the representatives, were so angry with the system that would make it very difficult to deal with the electorates – were so angry with the separation and sexual opposition.
"You'd think I've been in trouble," Mr. Schroyder reminded him of how he was in a relationship.
You'd think my corporate sponsor was "Kleenex."
I didn't think I couldn't think about what they were going to do.
"He's crying?"
The U.S.-China trade war officially can be useful for Beijing
The opening fires of the trade war between the U.S. and China were harsh, and experts believe that although it is far likely to end the battle, the country's dispute official may be useful for Beijing for a long time.
U.S. President Donald Trump, including solar panels, steel and aluminum, first warned China's main export goods by imposing taxes on the main export goods.
The most stressful, this week, with new rates that affect goods at $200 billion (£150 billion) effectively impose taxes on half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Officially, Beijing has met in the same form every time, and lately put tariffs at 5-10% to $60 billion from the United States.
China has promised that it would fit the United States in the same way, and it is not true that the world's second-largest economy will soon return.
It's important to move out of Washington's idea, but it's more difficult to move out of the U.S. to openly move to China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that the official investment in Beijing could be well appreciated, reducing the pressure of trade war with the United States by reducing the mutual dependence on the two countries' economics, China can safely support for a long time.
"The fact that in Easter Washington, even if it is possible, that the political decision to be made in Peking is more dangerous than what followers have previously experienced, is actually more dangerous than what they've done before."
Minister of Foreign Affairs says Syrian refugees "return"
Syria says it's ready for the repatriation of the Syrian refugees and is asking for help to re-establish the country that has been distributed by the war for over seven years.
Minister Valid al-Muhammad, who spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, said that the conditions in the country were improved.
"The situation in the country today is more stable and safe due to the fight against terrorism," he said.
In order to restore the normal situation, the government continues to deploy the territory of the terrorists.
There are currently all the conditions for the mutual economic measures that are deprived of their daily lives and their means of living, as well as for the resignation of refugees to the countries that they have to leave due to terrorism.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million people left Syria after the war began in 2011.
6 million people in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualim said that the Syrian regime has been rebuilt in Syria with the help to rebuilt a devastated country.
However, he emphasized that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the supporting countries.
Europe strengthens the victory of Rayder in Paris
The European team was won by the 2018 Rayder Champions League by defeating the U.S. team of 10.5 nationals, taking part in the Le Golf National in the outskirts of Paris.
The U.S. has been a sixth consecutive in Europe and has not won the Rayder Championship in Europe since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Byor's team has won the 14,5th of his victory once again to win the US.
In most parts of the tournament, U.S. club Fil Mikelson introduced his first shooting to Francesco Molinari in the 16th valley of Par-3.
Italian golfer Molinari has shine in all rounds as one of four players won 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Cordan Spit was defeated by Torborn Olesen, the lowest-level player in the European team from Denmark.
The world's high-speed player Dastin Conson Rayder also won the 2nd and 1nd British Ian Polter, who played his last game at the world's Conson Rayder Championship.
The 8th Rayder Champions League veteran Spanyard Sercio Garcia's career became the most victorious European to date for 25.5 months.
"I'm not crying, but I can't be judged today.
It's been a heavy year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
"This is the issue of the team, and I'm happy that my help touches," the Guardian said in an emotional manner after the European victory.
He gave the young man Con Reme, who won the 2 and 1 accounts in a single game that was held in the U.S.'s first-class goalkeeper's Tayger Vudsu on Sunday.
"I felt incredible pride when I was defeated by the Taygar Vudsu, and I am growing up following this person," said Con Rem, 23 years old.
In France, Vud has won all four matches and now has 13-21-3 accounts for Rayder Championships in his career.
It's a strange indicator for the person who is considered one of the biggest players of all eras, a second person with 14 important titles after Chuck Niklaus.
The U.S. team, who played high-level balls throughout the tournament, called for the whole week's struggle to find "fairway" except for Castin Tomas and Toni Finau.
After the U.S. captain Cim Furik's performance, he said: "I'm proud of these kids, they've been fighting.
This morning we've been pushing to Europe.
We've been fighting.
Congratulations to Tom.
He's a good captain.
All the 12 players played very well.
We will be regrouped, working with the PGA American and Rayder Championship Committee and moving forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud that I'm serving as a captain.
You have to congratulate yourself.
We've gone out of the game."
Innovation in the Red Creation and Stretching: Pinella, Menati and Sarasota decreased concentrations
The Florida Fish and Living Nature Commission (FWC) last report shows that in some parts of the Tampa Bay area, red-dispersion concentrations have been generally reduced.
According to FWC's information, Pinella, Menati, Sarasota, Sharlotta and Kollier apartments have been under-seasoned in the areas – this indicates that concentrations are reduced.
The red-wheelchairs extend to approximately 130 miles (209 km) along the coast from northern Pinella to southern Li apartments.
These subways can be seen in a distance of about 10 miles (16 km) from the coast of the Hillsboro apartment, but are less than last week.
It is also possible to observe the red light on the Easter.
The middle concentrations on Pinella or on its coast, high concentrations on the coast of Hilsboro, high concentrations on the coast of Menati, high concentrations on the coast of Sarasota or high concentrations on the coast of Sarasota, high concentrations on the coast of Sharlotte, central concentrations or lower concentrations on the coast of Li or left of Li
Pinella, Menati, Sarasota, Li and Kollier are continuing to complain about the irritation of the pathways in the apartments of the Pinella, Menati, Sarasota and Kollier.
Last week, there was no complaint about the injury in Northwestern Florida.
