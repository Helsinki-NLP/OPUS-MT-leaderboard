Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The degree, medal and $1.4 million check will be given to him for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The head of the White House as well as his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a loaded program.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose it in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple’s plan will then provide an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will experience its summit in the afternoon during a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. President to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee’s office itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the prize prize.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is running a war in two countries at the present time.
He reinforced war effort a few days ago by sending additional units in Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about €1.1 million).
He is a gift to good deeds, but he has not yet decided which.
His programme will then be conducted, along with his wife, to a banket, including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of the government and 250 other guests.
Obama was quite relentless at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling that he did not deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself, but for all who defend the same values as he.
From the announcement, he said it would be a "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of chanting
Litoměřice Police accused the president of the Litoměřice Association Society of Nature Protectors.
Repeatedly last year, he appealed for several construction workshop procedures and demanded money from investors for her personal profit in exchange for her appeal withdrawal, said Alena Romová, police spokeswoman of Litoměřice.
The Chairman of the Litoměřice Nature Protection Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and risks up to three years of imprisonment.
Waste selection bags are not perfume in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort their drinking packages, while in the villages of South Moravie you fall on benches of selection at each corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before finding the appropriate benches.
I don't mean we wouldn't get waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal advisers of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of the waste order not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially the number of waste tanks dedicated to it.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle into the city center?
It is a science that requires mostly time and steel nerves.
The only place I found for the moment is the Moravia place in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me, but it seems very little to me.
Without talking about the fact that in other neighborhoods of the city, it's not a synecure either.
Finally, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
That's crazy.
It's gonna make them a bit of a bitch to get up to the pitch.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw some glass bottles and PVC.
Except I have not seen any Kounicova street color bar.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overwhelmingly.
It is after all the center of Brno, who is supposed to represent the best city, isn't it?!
It is likely that ecology and claiming aestheticism are not too interested in Brno’s socialists.
They prefer to buy in the city a first hockey league place that makes the city shame throughout the country, instead of buying some extra beans and offering the selection of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m happy to have been able to comfort my impression with official statistics after taking a moment on the internet.
According to the company data EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek budget removed from retirement and disease leaves
After the left has increased, despite government opinions, farmers or officials may lack money for retirement, illness leaves or housing savings.
But also for interests on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When Social Democrats and Communists imposed an increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would loan for sensitive expenditure, retirement or illness leaves. "It's just putting the problems back later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is necessary to know that on the loaned money interest rates are increasingly high and that it will be refunded sooner or later.
The state really has no choice to know where to get money.
If it does not reduce social aid or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those left has now increased: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and shouldn’t be afraid of their retirement or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger state loss – next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cashes, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, debt will grow more and more rapidly, and with it, interest-related expenditure.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficiency package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of railroads and railroads due to the transfer of money to a few electorate groups.
It is mainly a decision-making and start-up of projects that cannot be modified to reduce costs.
Keep them at least, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major farms, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to a warning by Karel Hanzelka, spokesman of the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very well - it will get in the ČEZ dividends (provider and distributor of electricity), which the state mostly owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividend is never certain and that it is not in any case a bottomless pit.
Last year, there are 18 billion who have been shipwrecked from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividendes are serving to pay off environmental damages, to complete pension accounts or still serve as a reserve for preparing pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GDP in accordance with EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the carnival transfers.
The budget for various damages to victims of communism and crimes, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is unsure that the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, Janota notes.
The minister will then have to save on the side of the department or, in the worst case, touch the government’s budgetary reserve.
There is also a lack of 100 million in the two-billion state cash project, which must be able to track online the expenditure of each administration.
The first step will start in January.
If the Minister of Finance had no money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would have taken place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to move from one operating system to another by pressing one button.
The projects that have been revealed seem to be promising.
Just one button and you move from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is exactly this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personnel and professional
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones does not belong to fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced a test version to journalists, from a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously runs the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full rise.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to current devices in 2012.
Snow shortage in the mountains traces hotelers
Desert tracks are only a problem for lift operators.
The lack of snow disturbs people from booking their skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
For this reason, it is always possible to denial free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users search for deals, ask for prices but do not dare to make a reservation for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or snow at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, who operates the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to worry about booking.
If a priority is given to savings and the quality of accommodation is only coming afterwards, then you can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in Špindler currently only offer a weekly stay for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to place them for a while, but they'll also give them and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease,” Jandura said.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency Ingtours also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week is most interested in us at the moment, it is not completely sold.
We're still free, let's say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That is why we have already prepared a few cheaper last minute Christmas stays,” Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert said.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February are departing well, the remaining winter stays are selling on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are recovering during the week, Christmas will be complete too,” Schiefert said.
On the contrary, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We have a few last places for New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of Polish and February also sells well,” said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking area of Jánské Lázně is also complete to eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent Jánské Lázně hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of employment at the moment.
February is slightly lower for the moment, but as soon as the snow falls, the interest in stays in Krkonoše will certainly continue to grow, said Hotel Director Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Nevertheless, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
It will make it fresher on Thursday, and if there is precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather is expected to warm up, reports Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec station at the Czech Institute of Hydromeatology.
U.S.: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It becomes even comic, the asylum effort with which Barack Obama, president of the wise reputation, repeated his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he considered himself very simple.
When he finally left his doctrine so warmly awaited, he proved that he had recovered it into carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not happy to use in the text even several times the term "like in Iraq", he did not hesitate, which is, to use the title of the January 2007 Bush speech as the title of his own speech: "A new path forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraqi consumer of civil war as "unresponsible and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
However, the following months have shown that Bush’s strategy, which emphasized campaign commanders’ recommendations, was the only possible and likely to be so successful that current newspapers are not talking about Iraq at all.
This has not improved Bush’s reputation, it says, objectively speaking, left his successor a much more favorable final situation than we could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated in Afghanistan
The campaign commanders again asked him to increase the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House’s remarks despite the customs of subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president has been upset for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he has defeated at least 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to withdraw the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even if it was in the original 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to remove Afghanistan’s army within 18 months and complete all this process within three years, and the entire Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt the fact that a half increase will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - one cannot rely on a person and no treaty is respected.
Under these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change from leadership to day by day according to what they arranged.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only the dust behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity in relation to reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "speed state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
Obama's strategy's temporary horizon makes it disturbed by his volunteerism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the edge of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumultuous of the war in order to "break back home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will consider it as the indirect blindness of American defeat.
NATO’s last summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is toward the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically changing the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions have no effect on Iranians, Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem by using the military force.
For example, it will be necessary to respond when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of Afghan troops.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic reverse of the Afghan situation.
The only rustine for Obama is that it remains three years before the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time to plan on a new strategy, in case it would be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs Bank leaders will no longer receive cash prizes
Goldman Sachs’ top-range employees will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced it to respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leading leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to sell before five years.
Actions can be withdrawn to the leaders if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is the leader of the effort to connect wages with long-term performance at Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the global sense to be taken, former investment banker Douglas Elliott at JPMorgan said.
The concern is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after sharing nearly $17 billion for premiums in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political subject in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it was expected to afford a single tax of 50 percent of the bonuses of bankers exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prize in all areas other than physics.
These are five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prize in technical and literary disciplines from King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in chromosomes with their compatriot Jack Szostak.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize for Economy, American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have won this year was physical.
This award has now been given to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently based on all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the acquisition certificate of the pecuniary award.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category (about €1.1 million)
If one of them has many winner, they will share their reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been handed over this afternoon to U.S. President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he recognized the controversial nature of his award as he was only at the beginning of his journey and is also the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To discharge his policy, he added that in some situations war is essential for peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as he was voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and maybe the position of Janota in the office will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too important, which increases the public finance crisis.
This is the President’s spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his post on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should manage a shortage of 163 billion crowns.
However, the House of Deputies validated on Wednesday left-wing proposals for money transfers and increased official wages, social services operations and direct payments to farmers.
The government rejected the Social Democratic proposals that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left, the government, Klaus and the right, on the other hand, a disagreement that questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
The critics affirm that the budget, as voted by the Members, eliminates the savings package past the Fischer Government and that, according to him, has to distort the State's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but which does not require anything, said today during a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long overlooked the “serious problem” of the “unreflectable deficit” of public finances.
Now, he believes, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make improvements if it could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, according to the President.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget was exhausting and that the government should question its subsequent existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ODS, the ODS and the Greens is no longer working clearly.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
Chief of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek responded to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is exhausting and that it will exceed $200 billion.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the state budget for the next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood’s new film
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Invaincu film will expose a lot of things to the world about the country, its struggles and its victorys.
The story talks about sports, relationships between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an American award-winning Oscar actor, incarns the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, infamous fighting against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said he was a 18-year-old Mandela who asked him to incorporate it into the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I have to incarn you, I should be able to see you personally.
The 70-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of the boxing has, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery became himself a slave, a president of the fictitious U.S. people, or even God's life in the film Maencore's all-Power
The former South African state man was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of the apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaded and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the real story of Nelson Mandela's joint efforts and the South African rugby team captain François to unite the country. The newly elected president Mandela knows that his country remains still and always split racially and economically after the apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people by sport and decide to unite the rugby players who are among the world-class outsiders.
The South African team will end up progressing in the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman has worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story on a big screen.
“I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way to close it closest to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be in colisions before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to put his hand on him.
I realized that when I close your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits itself, and I felt as if you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he was six months old to prepare for a role in the hard middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me, and the first thing I told Francois Pienaar was: "I look much bigger in the movie."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the head of the director Eastwood received positive opinions and even talks about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarised his appreciation in the words: “It’s a very good story, a very well-directed film.”
In the reviews of films on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive ratings.
The mystery of Aura in Norway is resolved: Russians tested a missile
A strange lighting phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense has only admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile far from the Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the Bulava-type missile that initially had to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the cauchemar of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during missile tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she was damaged in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't steal"
A missile that doesn’t fly but is shining
This 13th trial took place at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the device.
It is obviously the engine of the third floor of the missile that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired from a moving and immersed ship
That’s why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been defected by a “Bulava”.
The Norwegians have no doubt for a moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generals argue that this time, we can’t talk about failure.
The first two floors of the rocket were resistant and the avarey only touched the third.
In previous cases, engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches had occurred without acronyms, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of nearly fifty percent employs the generals of optimism, and therefore they always claim that one day Bulava will fly without any problems and that it will even bring ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with the Moscow CSKA
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will appear again in a professional match at 51.
The former champion of the world, the Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup, will give strength to his team at the CSKA Moscow in need and will likely get its entry at the match of Friday against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career for forty years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to deal with some details about the form, said coach of the club Sergey Nyemtchinov, cited by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mind of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, the legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and gained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he won gold twice at the Olympics, seven championship titles, and won the Canadian Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected the honours in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the famous hockey temple since 2001.
Hyundai listens to trade unions and cancels all additional hours
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all additional hours.
This is just due to frequent additional hours that trade unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Petr Vaněk, spokesman from Hyundai factory, confirmed this.
However, the leadership wants to continue to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday working again this year.
We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, that’s why additional volunteer hours were offered on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
Sedmička.cz said the company offered a 400 Czech crown bonus to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a postteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Or they receive the supplement for additional hours, or they can place a replacement leave on 28 December and thus extend their last year holidays indicated by Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for lunch.
Given the fact that the additional hours were the most urgent and warmthful point in the comments and claims of trade unions as employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all additional hours for December.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory were forced to work almost two additional hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The trade unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the car factory and the trade unions must take place on Friday afternoon.
Union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday they were ready to stop the strike state in case they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The factory’s situation ended Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously struck because of an additional incessant hours.
They also protested against the bad conditions of salary and bizuta claims.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work in addition to fulfilling the car production requirements.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, trade unions also requested that employees who have stopped production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The trade unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in additional hours to a minimum.
In addition, they want a salary of 5,000 krones (209 €) this year.
The Hyundai automobile factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started production in series last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles by September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV "durable" viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top of the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at the moment.
However, the life of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the repression of this multiplication has an effect on the development of the so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Prague VŠCHT and the Heidelberg University opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarborane act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborates are a bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt assembly.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way of all medicines used so far and therefore they can overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of molecular mechanics of their bindings on the virus proteins.
The metalocarborates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protein is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV proteinase, there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV proteinase is stopped, the spread of the virus will also be stopped in the body of the patient, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In their works published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked to a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little smaller but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteinates has been tested in testing as well as on its resistant variants obtained in HIV-contaminated patients.
On the common version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarborates is not as strong as on clinical medicines, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common medicines are often ineffective.
Metalocarborates, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to be examined further in order to address the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Řezáčová.
Disputing around the budget. The ODS takes it to Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Democratic Civil Party), Mirek Topolánek, has qualified as "ejecting" the budget ratified for the next year, and according to him, the Prime Minister’s government, Jan Fischer, should question his existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the ODS’ speeches of drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokeswoman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative office supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether the House of Deputies should take support for the minority that is concerned to fight the growing deficit, or whether it is concerned to remain in its positions with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however, the proposals for amendments of 12 billion crowns included in the left.
The House has increased the money for employee salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grief towards the proposals of the Social Democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion dollars.
The ODS left the room before the vote, so obeying the government’s desire as a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of inutility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still consider the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave its functions in the event of ratification of amendments, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota took a meeting with Prime Minister on Monday after his passing to the government:
At the same time, he said he was wondering if he was going to remain in his positions.
His disappointment in negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, retirement, or the reform of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the government Fischer and of the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the ODS have done nothing harmful, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministry demand TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to give up his resignation by conducting a fight against the amount of public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the majority of left who is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and once it's on the agenda, I'll devote myself to it," said the Minister of Defense Martin Barták, elected to the government just by the Democrats, from the House of Journalists.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a discussion of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
The ODS went back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas, at the same time, stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if he had not expressly asked Democrats to allow the budget vote.
We do not feel orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had suffered disputes from the President of the Party in the House or in the country during the budget negotiations.
I have not noticed that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the next few months would be a bolshevism of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek responded personally.
According to the new timetables, there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit certain express or regional trains less charged as of December 13 and will, on the contrary, strengthen some other trains.
The total coverage of transportation will fall by two percent on the day of entry into force of new schedules compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the iron roads will add a pendolino copper.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be less fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decreasing in transport concerns the region of Hradec Králové by eight percent in total, on the other hand Prague and its surroundings can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
One of the biggest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: currently the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko settlement system, which is possible through the completion of the electricity of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
Remote lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague main station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart by two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13th.
This year’s invoice for regional railroads: 200 million additional crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Ironways next year for a total of four billion crowns to resolve visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year, knowing that the state will participate in nearly three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railroads appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not take advantage of an increase in prices by the vast majority of transport licences.
Changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and Internet tickets at a reduced price eLiška.
For travellers without discount cards, the price of ČD Net will rise from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will be newly dependent on the journey, while until then it was valid between cities of a region chosen and was at a single price of 160 crowns.
Philippines rebels still retain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels took 75 people to the south of the Philippines, including some students from a primary school and their teachers.
It is the AFP agency who informed, but who originally spoke of only 65 occupants.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The retirement took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
According to reports, approximately 19 rebels employed the kidnappers as human bowlers during a fleeing to the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining captures.
According to the AFP, rebels belong to the New Popular Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP, the police first pursued the deceasers due to violence caused in an accounting settlement between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in Maguindanao province south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23 November massacre related to the Governor’s administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of Southern Philippines was arrested as a result of suspicion of participating in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they have renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film will arrive in the U.S. halls in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the Czech official title is Invictus: Neporažený), and tells part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The world-known apartheid fighter's role returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarn him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, the feedback of critics and the public are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa, on the one hand, is in full preparation for the football world cup, and on the other hand because the media are worried about the rise of racial conflicts and discrimination among the inhabitants of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are at the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reserves issued to the main roles where Hollywood stars "beat".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by resuming his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I was well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able to recover from his energy, he said at the first official film in Los Angeles.
I think this is a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember through the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
It is the history of the South African republic, but it concerns each individual it has added.
Wear the rugby team's shirt
The film based on the history of the novel by British writer John Carlin is the title freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave his creation to the people draw the South African human rights defender during his term of presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries to collect two racial groups of a long-distance population, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995 was dressed in the South African team's national shirt on the world-wife sweat, which South Africa had won at the time.
In order to show up on the sweatshirt, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had long been ovulated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white population.
Hopefully the football championship will be able to unite people again in one nation, said Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical as he recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship begins on 11 June 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire fired in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps from the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman of the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They initially counted to let the transformer consume, but they revised their opinion and fired with a mixture of water, mushroom and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, a short-circuit internal of the transformer.
No one has been injured and, according to the spokesman of the company Pavla Mandátova, the incident does not threaten the safe operation of the entire transmission.
The damage is estimated at a few dozens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is off.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity, Čeps has not known anything similar and that such incidents are isolated.
Electric power supply has not been interrupted, said the company’s spokesperson for the North Bohemian Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of 400 kV transmission and 220 kV electric lines.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution positions with 67 transformers transferring electricity from transport sets to distribution sets and lines traces of a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura will file a complaint for diffamation against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, the owner of Student Agency, will today file a complaint for diffamation against three Social Democrats.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Janchura indicated it in Twenty Minutes of Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to exploit regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made fine mouths, while we made only a offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways that is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we have only to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for calomnies on the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that there was evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We will prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek believes that Mr. Jančura’s complaint is the following of his media show that serves him as a free advertising for his company and his person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same.
I suppose that this will be the opportunity to clearly show that Mr. Jančura is rightly manipulating the public opinion and using false and false arguments on regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already reported last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and plans to resum it after the New Year.
He pointed out that the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways to exploit the railways for an order of about 150 billion krone, without making tender calls.
According to Jančura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to Jančura threats by a Member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He appeared as a deputy of the ČSSD, I don't know who it is, but I won't say his name," Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
The vaccination against pneumococcus will be free and optional
The vaccination against pneumococcus will reverse old habits from January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already raised, saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcus culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices to pay for health insurance.
Experts also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not been vaccinated yet.
If we started vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay ourselves the following vaccines.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, one-quarter of families have volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcus.
However, parents paid $1,600 more for a dose.
The vaccination of younger people requires four doses.
Experts estimate that health insurance spends 300 to 450 000 crowns each year on vaccine doses.
However, they save medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
To date, the state spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all children’s vaccination.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the Janota package.
Pneumococcus are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of severe infections including inflammation of the lungs and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under the age of 10 have died due to pneumococcus infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a potential vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said a mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted vaccination against pneumococcus.
At an international conference at which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose this at least.
I think this is a direction that we need to follow now, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus.
We are not considering it at all at the moment,” said the spokeswoman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatrics, acknowledges that a vaccination based on voluntary defects.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a decrease in the renewal of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum, I understand the decision to make the vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
Experts predict that by next year more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
The vaccination against pneumococcus also marks a breakdown because it is the first child vaccination that is financed by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should be released from prevention funds, thus savings on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some Members feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to refund them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Vol"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal pictures for a value of $20 million (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interpelled while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical pellet to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his character drawings such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reports the press agency Associated Press (AP).
AP cited a police officer that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims that his father has been authorized to "infiltrate the museum, by any means, to carry the paintings into a storage facility," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta Senior refused to grant such permission, the agency said.
The Labour defends the increase in budget tax.
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and reduction in expenditure announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism of opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "has missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about the decline in the deficit by reporting his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also attracted the bubbles by attaching to low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals can be seen a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% ceiling rate on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Security
The trade unions protested that low wages were punished by a recession that they were not responsible and warned that they were only announcing “problems”.
The reduction in social insurance – which will get about £3 billion a year – has put the world of businesses angry, because he believes it is a job tax while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET RAPPORT
Social Insurance will continue to increase by 0.5% as of April 2011
The economy will decline more than 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
Increase of corporate profit tax for small companies has been abandoned
Discounts of electric cars and winds taxes
Retirement increases by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person who wins £30,000 will lose £90 per year and a person who wins £40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person who wins £100,000 per year will gain £110 more.
The ministers said their goal of reducing the deficit by 2013 was "tough decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weight over the first 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, Treasury Secretary, rejected a tax increase and stressed that a reduction in expenditure was a "bottle of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would start again at the end of the year.
However, Labour forecasts on economic growth - which will influence the amount it will borrow and the speed to which the deficit will be fulfilled - have been questioned after the Chancellor has been forced to revise its first figures.
In his allocation, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the forecast.
"A missing opportunity"
The Conservatives who will launch a new advertising campaign that warns Labour’s “debt crisis” on Thursday said the project to borrow £789 billion over the next six years was unveiled.
Ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, voting "cynically" tough elections until after the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They have not presented anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the Cabinet's Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future reductions, unlike Tory’s proposals that would lead to a faster and greater decline in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money collected by the increase in taxes and the reduction of expenditure would be used to support next year's expenditure rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were "built on the wind".
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the announcement schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor face propaganda charges, while the money was simply recovered next year.
However, the Labour insists that additional aid is provided while people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although the ministers did not publish the expenditure details after 2011, economists said it was clear that public expenditure restrictions would only begin to feel in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Fiscal Studies) claimed that Chancellor figures in the future involve substantial reduction in many areas, including potentially transportation, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually just delayed," said his director, Robert Chote.
“The most important ads will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor at Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. The markets are aware of it."
FBI investigates “American arrests in Pakistan”
The FBI investigates the arrest of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties in Pakistan.
Men were arrested during a raid in a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, told the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating the same men who had been declared missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said he was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them were presented as a Pakistani ascension, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the accusations against them are and under what conditions they are detained,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokeswoman, said the agency had known the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We're working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their activities there, and if they are really students who have been carried away," she said.
Pakistan's Embassy in Washington said men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them.
She said that the house was already monitored by the local police and that no charges had been brought against the arrested men yet.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comments on arrests, Reuters said, but the United States had to "cooperate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to destroy the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been carried away from their home by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian abuse
In the past twenty years, human rights have been as little as ever respected, according to the Amnesty International Association report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the campaign of the presidential elections of June.
A man mentioned in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
The authorities have stated that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has led to the greatest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens were sentenced to prison sentences and prosecutors claimed that at least five people were sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, correspondent from the BBC in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the close of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"Fake Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who had been accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
“They often hit me on my face,” he said.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliate me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate losing elections, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that detained protesters after the election were tortured to death and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied allegations of rape, but admitted that abuse had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been locked in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial system set up a committee to investigate post-election disorders and government responses, but it claimed that the mandate and powers of these bodies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee were not made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the last three weeks in order to prevent other protests.
Ski tracks built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to transform Bristol’s site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 skiers and semi-professional snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park, a small tremplin preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth year student in medicine, said that the view of the top of the track was beautiful, but that it was quite scary.
This is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in the counters.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country – with real talents,” he added.
Prizes awarded the best volts - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday evening, the snow will be abandoned to the fountain.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a laic state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the last book of the author, "Why the French do not like foulard" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for fifteen years and whose effects still feel today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious frame.
Good anthropologist, he doesn’t just want to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what’s happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very well able to listen and reproduce the discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or the mayor (or both)?
Should homosexuals’ evolution and rights be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use a interest-based banking system to get a loan?
These are the practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern laic society.
They do not raise the debate until the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their fellow lawyers of a Sunni Purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laicity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
It is wondering how French politicians (and the guarding intellectual elite so virulent of laïcity) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims have not been destroyed, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historical compromises with Laic Republicanism.
Instead of growing pragmatism, it detects a "nearness of key values".
After reading this book, we are trying to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, bringing with it life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their seal.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, author and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Knowing the history and the complex policies of wave fishing, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers who proved to them by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspiring who had to fight only the point of his mousquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught as they swim alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent into zoos and circles.
In the early 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the surface needed for an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae that grew into its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells stories of other writers and historians and often relates to the threat of hunters on the survival of species.
Although it is forbidden in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians in motoski use powerful assault guns to hunt their kidneys.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a fascinating insight into what maybe the future will be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately relate to the speed of changes.
It's not the fault to try.
At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering trips gave the first information on the ice calotte’s fountain.
The Cold War submarines then cartographed the relief changes under this submarine.
Satellite surveillance and icebergs are greatly helpful, but the greatest of the work is done by endured men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson considers the extraordinary and small world of the Arctic Ice Tax System, formed by the water grids pressed by gelance.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, maybe it will be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on the tombs in Arlington
The first grade De'Angello Robinson, 19, made a seven-hour bus trip to put a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who one day were in their place.
In a few months, we will be sent from there, we risk to be in their place," Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to put crowns on the tombs of the veterans, in different sections of the ceremony cemetery of Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the ceremony of Arlington.
Now, to continue a 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (The Crowns across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the cemetery of Arlington, around Pentagon, on the cemetery of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for the victims of the 93 flight from United Airlines to Shanksville, Pennsylva.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation gave more than $15,000 to buy and transport crowns.
Charleen Hunt, a 70-year-old from Westminster, said she had made her trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had been sacrificed.
It’s a small thing that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Emmitted in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the pitches and the extended hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs dated from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimism, while the children were playing, and the couples stood by hand, wearing fresh pin crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red node on top.
Nearly, he planned silence on Section 60, where most veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are infused.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of current wars encompassed the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others prayed and families and friends were supporting in the cold air.
Some read the names grabbed in the stone with a loud voice, while others screwed to see the small black and white information cards, wrapped in the wet land for those whose tomb had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the tomb of her son.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and took eight hours to come to the tomb of Marine Sergeant Gunnery David Shane Spicer, who died in the battle in July.
No one should never forget what we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
American citizen arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a U.S. citizen who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the prisoner arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graffiti and speeches are considered to be serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and she is followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to go to receive awards, but authorisations have always been rejected.
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brothers Government in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "dough" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday evening.
The new U.S. policy insists on the Cuban government to move forward by concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do so.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation corresponding to a salary day.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
The Cubans who wish to connect must often communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is limited.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans in custody in Cuba are behind the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attached to U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't provide more information about the arrest.
Detention and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open company, would be permitted -- freely distributing mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Program Americas of the Human Rights Watch Group, who recently published a rigorous report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as his malade as the country's leader.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, when both countries begin to move a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent complot for sending men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities found an organization supposed to prepare a complot to send five North Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped that the case would allow for a large network of terrorist recruits who equate the Internet to search for radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them join the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, al-Qaeda home and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistani secret services, who was informed of the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men did not participate in the CIA complot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
For this reason, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the prohibited mountains of the northeast as a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of maintaining the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the permissions necessary to get entry into al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI -- insists on the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and perhaps more importantly in the determination of people to whom they trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, U.S. secret services have prioritized infiltration of men into the al-Qaeda network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, refusing to enter those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have to be more and more careful, in recent years in choosing people they accept because U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what is the best way to follow his recruitment model than so many other people have ever followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen demand "action" for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked in the streets here on Saturday, demanding a more important action on the climate by negotiators working at the Bella Convention Center Palace in the city.
The number of protesters was estimated to be 100,000, but 25,000, according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively calmly, although a small number of masked activists had lighted some explosives near a set of government buildings in the center of the city.
On the day that little has happened during UN-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists have travelled around the city, deploying pancarts in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities have joined protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said travelling to her mother’s native country, Peru, opened her eyes on the devastating problems that the country has to face due to the impact of climate change already occurring."
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the big step -- to make the word pass and to call world leaders to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be done, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people because they weared a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to Bella center and said she had arrested 19 people because they weared a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passager who asked to keep the anonymity due to its involvement in climate discussions, activists carrying masks and black clothes, fired several explosives near Copenhagen’s main channel, surrounded by several ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first missiles, followed by "some major explosions."
Inside the Congress Palace, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it appears that protesters have failed to wake up the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international debates, he replied in English, "In fact, that's something I didn't know.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring, “Because the event is important, I can’t hear what’s happening outside.”
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful according to perspectives.
It shows the interest of the large public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disturb negotiations or harm the freedom of others.”
Test results reveal stable differences between breeds
Last week’s federal report on mathematics results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District still remains far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have been far more advanced over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress) are the persistent difference between the results of African Americans and Whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their Afro-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, ranging from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of Afro-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) usually remains constant, falling only from a point, from 245 to 244.
The average white results were not included in the test results as the sample was not significant enough.
The overview of a six-year period is not more encouraging.
In 2003, the difference between blacks and whites in Class 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Director of Group of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democracy) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I don’t jump for joy for one or two winning points, Kwame R. Brown, a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary (Basic School).
Frequently criticized Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city’s middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what is scary is that we don’t dedicate enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at school school classes at the end of the elementary cycle and college start who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their school course and which are late enough compared to their comrades.
Every day, the mathematics program for Kindergarten classes at Grade 6 (6th) emphasizes real-life games and experiences, such as they were set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to continue working to provide better interventions to these students at lower level than those of the class, said Rhee.
Others believe that NAEP results ask whether Rhee can continue to raise the system's overall results while providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce divergence.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an educator at the University of Berkeley in California, studying the results of the city tests.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
This target may also have political impacts that disturb this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other superintendents of schools, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they originate, can be assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the default of success was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in the District of Washington, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the force to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with the trade unions of his teachers last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "departure point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long ride.
Graciela Rodriguez, a 12-year-old, climbs down and climbs a moment of eyes in the sight of white columns, brick facades and green pebbles.
Graciela's parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never put foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where school fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less than that of an impressive new student than an enthusiastic.
Super That’s where I’m going to study! cried Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide guided them to the entrance of the science building.
Youpi, really? she said dreamy, when it was indicated the low ratio of law professor - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to the university:
The question is where.
Although this is still widely asked for the large number of American children born from Spanish immigrant parents who left high school where they became teenage parents, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a second-generation Hispanic on five-hour high school studies - a remarkable success if one considers that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, researchers say, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
Scientists who study fighters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
The mentorat programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the university - particularly if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who don’t have experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, won’t help them,” said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support for these children, from maternity to high school.
The federal program that financed the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as the name of GEAR UP (prepare you) , it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when low-income families students are in middle school (school) and continue to the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has succeeded in attracting major oil companies to rebuild its difficult infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi oil ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and Europe oil companies are on the way to play a major role in the state-of-the-art of Iraqi oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies are shared with participation in only two out of 10 auction fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction that started Friday.
The only one who had made an auction was lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for fields placed in auctions in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil industry in Iraq has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American societies, they are Asian and European companies that open the road, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website for information on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, confirmed by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability while U.S. military troops withdrawn, have braked U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantages due to their rivals, particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were considerably lower and were more willing to take risks because they were not to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the Ministry.
The most important U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintained strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and gave him their technical advice, have left empty hands.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts assigned this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the State, has more surveys on contracts than other companies and is shared with significant shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokeswoman of the oil ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal to its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selectioned companies for submitting auctions made tenders that were then compared to the price per bar that the ministry agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of the major al-Qaeda organizers would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that an American missile, who hit along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, said U.S. anti-spionage authorities on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murder attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car on Tuesday, near Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles had been fired by a non-pilot aircraft of the type used by the CIA within the anarchist tribal border of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani civilian secret services, expressing himself at Miran Shah's phone.
Representatives of the Authority said the suspected local militants have climbed on site and quickly confiscated what remains of "completely demolished bodies".
It was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorism representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somali was part of the dead.
Somali was described as one of al-Qaeda military organizers who conducted terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize complots around the world, one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes within the Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspirations of attacks on the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic guidelines of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said Somalia had rapidly progressed in al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known for the U.S. public, but this does not reduce the threat it constitutes for us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second major character of al-Qaeda or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a tribal band of militants, as well as three other operators.
The rhythm of CIA drones attacks has decreased since summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also unwillingly killing suspected computers, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
UN Special Envoy Kai Eide said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March at the end of a tumultuous mandate entailing corruption allegations extended during UN presidential elections.
The Aid departure took place while the Obama administration decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
The U.N. spokesman said he supported this increase, but he expressed his concern about the United States calendar for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a Kabul telephone interview.
Our commitment must be in the long term.
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials by assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but he would simply respect the commitment he had made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start searching for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who has recently presided over a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who has previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Aid's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and dissimulating evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but he said Galbraith's allegations -- which were thankful -- "haved harm to the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism in terms of international observation of elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted with the UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than they are assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would allow them to have more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration with the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the severe UN employment regulations disturbed her possibilities of bringing new talents.
The UN rules are such as I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's disastrous and it can't last.
Gates: Iran has to submit additional sanctions
Defence Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran due to its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, expressing himself in front of a pool of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week’s visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, devastated the possibility of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such a defeat.
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it is well the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians in the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer hugely" of these sanctions.
In a statement by the White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “probable” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory agency, the International Energy Agency (AIA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he stated that he would reinstate the dialogue on reducing his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon an important part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for desperately necessary fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed such an agreement, a means of developing confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has seemed to have been far from attempts to agree – partly, experts say, because Iran’s leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Honestly, in my opinion, the raid of Iran against some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has pushed the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not planned, in the course of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before he turns to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "advanced sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfunded allegations" of certain members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and claimed that it agreed to continue negotiations with the United States and five other major world powers in order to achieve a long-term solution.
Gates, who had to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the troops' leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurdish and the Arab majority in Iraq persist, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops, from 115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August.
Gates also wishes to calm down Kurdish anxiety about suspended withdrawal. U.S. authorities cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq."
We will not abandon you."
Aging in China, a change in direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up around a propaganda show that told them, “The Mother Earth is too tired to welcome more children” and “A baby plus, it’s an additional tomb.”
They learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rate of birth in their city and the aging of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantly and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no seconds, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has a son of 8 months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child’s policy in China, creating two generations of unique children famously with good toys, called “small emperors,” a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution is expected to explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older represented nearly 22 percent of the population of the residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said fertile couples should have babies in order to "aid to reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a lack of labour in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive relief
Written in the Constitution of the country in 1978, the Chinese policy of the single child is so far the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination at work.
Chinese authorities have assigned the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuse in implementing this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women to abort a second child.
In addition, many couples have used selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-girl ratio.
In recent years, the population responsible authorities have gradually raised their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they gave more exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, ethnic minorities and cases in which men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they gave a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research, at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first city in China to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters that encourage families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city’s government has prompted family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples at their home, and pull prospectus under their door.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the answer was disappointing.
Disillusioned response
Although officials in a rural town in Shanghai county say they have seen an increase in demands for couple dossiers wishing a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, for example, always receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, claim that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of Family Planning Committee in the Caolu Municipality of Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to see their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and they are legally allowed there.
But like many Chinese, they only have minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Western people misrepresent that the policy of the single child is a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant for seven months of the first child of the couple.
It's true, we're lucky to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
That's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resource Manager, said she wanted only a single child because she was herself. "We were the center of the family and we had the habit that everyone cared for us."
We don’t get used to taking care of someone else and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, and the owner of a translation company, says the most crushed.
For couples working to two, middle-class, who make the rate of birth down, he says, it is necessary to be selfish for success.
People 20 or 30 years old grew up seeing their parents fighting in the early times of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he said.
Even one child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must leave at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best maternity."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen said, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher level of life, he says.
We don’t want to sacrifice too much.
The United Nations Group has plans to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized by unorganized assignments and mutual discrimination, came back under the fire of the ramp on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations burning most of the time in the next few years.
The text that could provide the foundations of a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases has emphasized the remaining obstacles, as it has clarified the way to take.
But it has been seen as a significant progress in the negotiations that are lacking time, with more than 100 leaders from all over the world coming to Copenhagen next week.
Written by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give the poor to support climate warming in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the higher limit of global temperature rise that would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, representative of the Sierra Club at Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what UN Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer described on climate change, as being the "complete image".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, countries would reduce emissions from 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also restarted the negotiations on Friday, promising to supply $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change – to support floods and dryness or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. Climate Representative of negotiations, has rejected any discussion obliging the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared with the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China than the Bush administration was, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern, who also regretted that the text is not insufficient to ensure that reduction can be verified by external observers.
Stern made comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei stated that the U.S. chief negotiator was “good sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not financially help China to fight climate warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers in play, defects have appeared both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle concerns more the saving of individual economies than the saving of the planet, with China and the United States arguing on their respective obligations, while the poorer nations insist on the fact that the two dozens of most influential countries ignore the scientific requirements to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rica delegate, said it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting for who would have to suffer the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, which is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say that negotiations will lead to a political agreement at least.
The Allied Small Insularies, which gathers 43 members, made a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said the action of small island states "has put a political pressure on the complete political process", in part by what they are now unified and they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
Debates have become an urgent issue, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems in instance before heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as India’s Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister came down from their plane and hurried into the Bella Center building to attend home-closed meetings and information conferences to make claims that will be studied next week.
The true image of the assembly -- wherein 13,000 people enter and leave the Congress Palace every day -- guitar players present night-class shows from countries that they think are betrayed and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity only increases: almost all major ministers are here and not later on Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We enter the Grand Court, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Conservation International Global Policy, said.
Heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will re-define Monday’s syndrome
At 5:00 a.m. Monday morning, a sifflet strike will perish at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in the UK.
The country's first high-speed high-speed train will reach 225 km/h, while it will run from Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin district train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of Midlands, North and Scotland in London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing towns, the duration of business trips will be much longer, and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing the swelling on the roads.
In theory, the three major political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new iron network, inevitable planning battle and environmental hazard fears are at risk of braking British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to make a feasibility report for the government, will send its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to get a detailed map of the next step planned route for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and places where environmental impacts can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a higher high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer the spring.
The preferred options are set forward in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will reach West Midlands.
The line will be separated in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Peninsulas in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A unique line will cross Scotland.
“It seems to be the best performance option,” said a rail professional.
When it is finished, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hourly journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow 400m long trains and can transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can run on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can host 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space limits, an existing station is expected to be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks that the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built partly.
Trains will first be forced to drive off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, maintaining travel durations between London and Scotland more than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a passage of planes to trains, which constitutes a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Refund the loan of £75,000 for Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, chief member of the Tory parliament, has made the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orange he built in his home from his district.
The party’s official who was retrograded by David Cameron for complaining that parliamentary members were “trained,” increased his loan by £75,000 to build a sharp extension to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to pay additional interests, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received complaints at that time and were not interrogated by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducted a control over members' expenditure. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clear or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village of his district of Rutland - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the Emulsions Office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan has not been asked to give an explanation for the increase in loans during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee on its provision of prior loans.
The Committee blamed him last month of any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan modified the legal security of his loan of £271.406 of his London property at the home of his circumference purchased in 1991, the year before he became a member of the parliament.
The papers published this week show that Mr. Duncan claims approximately £1,400 per month of lending interest by March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than £1,800 per month.
Duncan's RBS loan interest rate was not changed at the time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of £75,000.
The RBS standard variable interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, without moving since.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request £1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the ghost office in September, after a covert journalist told him that parliamentary members would have to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live "on budget" and you have been treated as "f...e"
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small piece, based on what was right.
I could have asked more, but I didn’t.”
The parliamentary millionaire since his former office as a oil dealer began to have to explain his expenditure in May, after it appeared that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before he agreed with the expense office that this could "be considered excessive."
An activist crashed a hole in the form of £££ in Mr. Duncan's pitch, to protest after it was revealed he had requested £4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase of the loan last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the Cost Office and Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with theft or elaboration or use of rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithfuls, all of you come to see the Brighton Adventure calendar
Brighton’s beach cabins have found a new way of promoting the winter months, an interactive Adventure calendar.
Beyond, a group of alternative church that encourages spiritual exploration by creativity, 24 owners invited to decorate their cabin for every day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, whereas visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 17:30 to 18:30 a.m., every day, with pastas and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs that we have chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest from Chichester diocese and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should approach people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality."
Strong mobility in Copenhagen and the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police have made several hundred interviews.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the organizers, have fled into the cold in the Danish capital, outside the United Nations Climate Conference, responsible for entering into an agreement that may enter into force by Friday 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the increasing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these events, has contributed to making the “political price” a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the departure of the courtyard, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke paves and martial veins, AFP reporter said.
Anti-Smoke police were immediately intervening without households.
In total, police announced the intervention of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violence groups that were illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were interpelled "without distinction", emphasizing that one hundred of them were "always kept in the street on Saturday evening" and kept in a sitting position despite extreme cold.
Parliament party, the courtyard, rather good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene was set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters came from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen, called the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seas" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for eco-debt repairs for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t continue to say: we have time, the Benino singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, waterways where you can walk like you have never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the altermondialist movement approached environmental organizations.
French eurodeputed José Bové, figure of altermondialism, said he came to Copenhagen to "bide climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cutting between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, has caused a strike of protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down to the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, most of them students, went out in red, treading bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred protesters have also pledged to demand an energy action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations held by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (east).
A few dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazie elects its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilissi denoted a "farce".
Approximately 131,000 people were invited to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
Voting offices closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before the closing, Abkhaze election Commission officials said.
The first provisional results should be announced on Saturday to Sunday night.
The five lice candidates, including the outgoing president Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakachvili “records that Abkhazie has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” said Manana Manjgaladzé, spokeswoman.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which caused thousands of deaths, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the vote office at a school in Soukhoumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palms in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential area in this region to the sophisticated landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the President and the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed somewhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
"We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful," he said during a small ceremony, alleging the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, rising a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control of the abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims not to support the current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% more than one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second tour must be held within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people traveled around the world on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the survivor, interfered with nearly 700 people in the march of an imposing protest.
According to the police, a hundred thousand people, according to the organizers, went into the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes 193 delegates until December 18, looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament party, the courtyard, a generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without seeking to enter.
A scene was set to welcome the planned speakers, before a candle watch with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Desmond Tutu.
A few minutes after the departure of the court, a group of hundreds of protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and martyrs, broke the glasses, a journalist from the AFP found.
Anti-heavy police immediately surrounded them and intervened without households, throwing many of them to the ground.
The police announced the intervention of 600 to 700 people, stating that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these ultra-violence groups that had been illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured at the mist by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during accidents that led to the interpell of 20 people, police said.
We see the extremist groupuscules, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the helicopters of the order forces turned into the sky.
Most protesters, who came by and trained the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen, called the Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue seas" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we go down the streets to ask for eco-debt repairs for the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine militant from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are water courses where you can walk while you have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the United Nations Convention, the altermondialist movement approached environmental organizations.
French eurodeputy José Bové, figure of altermondialism, told the AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "bide climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no cut between fighting against climate warming and fighting for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilised several personalities, including Danish mannequin Helena Christensen, former UN refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who had to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many particularly vulnerable islands to warming, has caused a strike of protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, were down to the streets in Australia.
In Manille, a few hundred people, students mostly, demonstrated, dressed in red and trees boasting the solar energy in front of the capital of the Philippines.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, a few hundred protesters have also pledged to call for action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations held by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, including Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (western) and Lyon (east).
A few dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The geo-history is reinforced from general high school reform, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear on Sunday JDD that history and geography were "reforcing" the reform of the general high school, despite the removal of their mandatory teaching at the scientific terminal.
Now, first-class students will have the same program for a shared common culture every four hours a week, says Chatel.
For the minister, "you must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sphere is no longer a scientific sphere" but "in large part, it concentrates the best students".
The lines ES and L cannot remain underlines of the S, he continued, emphasizing: “I have also heard many historians and intellectuals ignoring the absence of the history-geography in the terminal in technological high schools.”
On Saturday, an Ifop survey in Humanity revealed that nearly seven French out of ten (69%) disagreed with the government’s project to remove the mandatory teaching of history-geography at the terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this deletion, as well as the left and some right-wing elected.
The Minister, on the contrary, added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of the terminal programme S.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a Tuesday day of mobilization to protest against the project, which they believe is the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an admissibility test at the beginning of the year that will carry on their discipline, and at the end of the year an admission test that will carry on their ability to teach, the Minister said.
They will also follow situational stages during the M2 year and then be a first year before students as trainees.
If you add all the stages offered before the competition, you already get more attendance before the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister said he would propose "individual right to training, something that does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the project to remove the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge raised Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of the Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize, inaugurated the first of the Ernest conferences, a day consisting of a chain of experts, each fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from the AFP said.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and gives them the desire to know more, explained in the march of the 22-year-old conference Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of the day that draws his name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school's basin.
There are twenty interventions among the experts in their discipline and they are selected for their charismatic side, he said.
As for climate warming, “you can talk about hours, but you can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel, who expressed himself without notes, but with the help of graphics, in front of a hundred people.
This is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will continue to believe that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos taken from these conferences will be online on the school site from December 15th.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bimestrial pace.
Payment networks: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
Prison supervisors on Friday called for "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end of the year's holidays of additional premiums and hours whose payment was resigned in January for budgetary reasons.
FO-prisoner (2th supervisors trade unions) asked staff not to be in service to demonstrate before prison institutions on Tuesday morning and "blocking them" to "convict the stealing of their debts".
The CGT-Pensionary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "assemble in general meetings in different prisons for a strong mobilization", judging "shamed and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "additional hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prisonary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "she calls for general mobilization . . . to lift discontent and anger".
The Department of Prison and the Ministry of Justice explained that the additional hours increased significantly in 2009 and that not all were budgeted, but ensured that the remains would be paid in January.
The Chancellor said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to supervisors' unions ensuring that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts of the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the head of the prison administration to promptly implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation, born from a bad assessment of the number of additional hours, does not reproduce in the future, adds Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The December payment will therefore be slight, except for leadership personnel who benefit from the famous premiums of functions and goals, the Ufap/Unsa regretted, for which "budgetary limits have good back".
It is a pure scandal, the FO interregional union of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott up to a new order "all meetings and convocations".
Personals will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regulated in December, going for additional hours, also threaten FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time when we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to take care of the staff’s money, the Bordeaux CGT-Pensionaire estimates.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, while some are less poor than others.
But in any way the account is not there, said the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer “more cute tricks” than those he receives.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, has confessed to the "pope" of the little screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: "I give more beautiful things than those I receive."
As part of a special broadcast that will be broadcast on the ABC channel Sunday evening, President Michelle and his wife offer an overview of how they are looking to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the small four-foot family companion will be of the party.
Christmas Dad also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would have "of course" a gift, according to extracts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama fakely enrolled against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “I certainly didn’t, I offered you nice gifts last year,” she said.
Absolutely, had he been forced to concede before replicating with humor by showing the finger on the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who offered you this?"
During this one-hour release, in the atmosphere distracted, with the famous animator who was a strong support from Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama spoke about a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball ball that his Kenya father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a basketball ball, the president said.
It was only a long time later in my life that I realized that he had given me this balloon.
The first lady remembered her side of her motherfucker's house.
I didn’t really know how to organize a house, so I had all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranged them around the chain, but I loved this little house of puppies, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reopened, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reopened in Los Angeles due to significant "injury" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reopened on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia undergoing in Paris on November 26, she reported her press service in Paris, stating that these injuries had "necessary surgery."
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical newsletter would be announced within 48 hours.
According to RTL, Johnny Hallyday, a partner of the singer's last tour, would have been thrown into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only within 48 hours that we will have a little bit more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opens an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by the AFP, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented the information.
RTL also claims that "in accordance with certain sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International clinic for this discal hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, was conducted by the neurosurgery Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday evening to comment on RTL information.
Following the operation on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized on Monday at the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles for an infection consecutive to the intervention.
Songwriter Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on RTL Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but he assured not to worry about the rocker, who is "a fighter".
He had called me just before he went to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was a fucking thing because doing 12 hours of plane after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, singer producer Jean-Claude Camus wanted to be quiet, claiming that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfyingly with antibiotics" and that the infection was "disturbed".
Mr. Camus also said he had interviewed Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been surgery with a "small colon cancer" and then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66", presented as his goodbye tour.
But since then, every health problem has been abundantly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the difficulties of the singer to move on stage.
In mid-November, his neighborhood had even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/title pool: the first Bousquet on its fetish distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medal at the World-2009 Grand Swimming Pool, scored an international title on a distance that he particularly enjoys, the 50-meter free swimming, at the Euro-2009 small Swimming Pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition when the combinations are permitted for the last time saw only three world records fighting while waiting for a delay.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relais 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who deceived on the world record of the 50-meter free, of which he holds the brand in a large pool (20.94).
On one of the two royal distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it is the 28-year-old French who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the departure against eight normally, a first internationally.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the global brand (20.30) as he had planned.
We can always dream better and in the dark, I said that if the world record was at my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers were dressed in polyurethane combinations, which will be prohibited from January 1.
At the beginning of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their era in Istanbul, which had received the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations this time did not serve German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in large pool this summer in Rome, world records to the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the brand he held on 400 m free swim (3:32.77) but still imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), in front of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself a deeper sense of this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: a sarcophage panel belonging to Zola added $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophage panel that belonged to French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly above its estimate, Sotheby's art merchant announced.
This panel before two meters long on 63 cm high, dated from the third century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble “representing four dionysiacal scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyres and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world,” explained Florent Heintz, Vice President of the Art Auctions of the Roman and Egyptian Antiquity at So.
He was sold among hundreds of lots.
The sale is still in ongoing, but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most envoyed so far, a spokesman of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, told the AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola comes back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then appeared successively with French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bath in his particular Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France, and shortly before entering the marrechain, President of the Council.
It remained a shadow area of about fifty years.
By scanning the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "success Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the freshness of "Rougon-Macquart".
Avortized departure attempt from Zelaya of Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer fulfilled for transferring to its territory from the Honduras dechu President Manuel Zelaya, who had rejected a non-conducted by the Putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not meeting, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government’s aircraft has returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migrations.
The Putschist government wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to "refuse" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a behaviour.
But the Dechu President refused because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest executive.
The Putschist government “has experienced a new failure by wishing me to give up [...], they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo on Thursday, on which he often expresses himself since the beginning of the political crisis that has last five months in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some agreements the dechu president, refugee at the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
Mexico's Embassy has submitted us a request for other than driving, but unfortunately we can't accept it because it does not contain asylum requests, puth government Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Hondurian radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum to any country, replied Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduras people, he said.
Mr. Zelaya’s departure rumors had mobilised on Wednesday the Dechu President’s supporters, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their seat.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government towards international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been reversed on June 28, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare his reelection, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
Emigrated to Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and fled to the Brazilian Embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested to respond to the crime of "high betrayment" which is accused of justice, according to the Putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti succeeded in organizing a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin America countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street raises U.S. trade balance food optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures showing the resuming of activity both in the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final ending figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced from 68,78 points to 10.405,83 points, and the Nasdaq, to technological dominant, from 7.13 points to 2.190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index added 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different economies, Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial said.
But this remains anecdotic, she temperates, considering that the market focused on “half full glass”.
According to Peter Cardillo, from Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, “which shows that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit decreased in October by 7.6% compared to September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the opposite of a craving of the deficit.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The great news is the growth of trade volumes, particularly for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the U.S. major trade partners, said Christopher Cornell, the research company Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against any expectation last week, reaching 474,000 demands.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job applicants has “falled to the lowest for a year,” Scott Marcouiller, Wells Fargo Advisors, said.
The obligatory market has fallen.
The profit of the Treasury good at 10 years increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% Tuesday evening and the profit of the good at 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% at night.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power conspicuous "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power convicted wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another manifestation for which a dozen dissidents were interpelled.
A quarantine of "White Ladys", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were convicted on the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro while they were traveling to the center of the capital to claim the release of political prisoners, a reporter from the AFP said.
At the bottom of the Yankees, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" scanned, the lifted pong, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came "assured their protection".
The evening, a similar protest took place against "Ladies in White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, they were interpelled by civilian police officers, a reporter from the AFP said.
Police forced the dissidents in civil vehicles who were convicted by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Dissident interpellations under similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
The 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize recipients, "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissidence, one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purified a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain under the lines.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercener" or "agents" to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported the manifestation of pro-governmental militants against “contra-revolutionary” on Thursday.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of shattering rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced kills an octagoner at the knife and wounded 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
Two knives armed killed an octagoner and injured five more people in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at an hour of affluence, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor had hit with two knives and for uncertain reasons, an octogener, in or in front of a pharmacy of the 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
Heavily injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police unions officer, died in the hospital due to his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, aged 30, interposed and injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenaire was sucked.
The days of the other injured are in danger, and vital organs are apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then made a disturbance and had been hospitalized "in shock condition", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the drinking of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then escape the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He would have injured two passagers, apparently by accident: one thirty-fourty-year-old, the latter greeting.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two knives that he was carrying on the cross behind his back, explained on site a trade union officer in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passagers, including young people, have tried to control the forced, according to evidence collected by the AFP.
I've seen a 30-year-old guy with a green shirt.
Three young people tried to intercepte it.
They didn't get there because the guy was costuous, reported Alberto, server at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke the pocket, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of 61, two municipal police officers, their responsible, attempted to interfere with the armed man and were injured in strikes, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many stores.
Passengers came to tell me there was a person injured out there.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, put it in security, and I saw a very important wound in my stomach, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of thirty years arrived, injured by knife.
They are national police officers who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Parquet of Nanterre received the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Department of Justice Police (SDPJ 92).
The forced man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his eye guard.
A police source did not exclude that he was entered into a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers needed to master him at the Clichy police department where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all forced species whose forces decompose under the effect of action".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again claims to abandon prosecutions
Polish-Franco-Poland film lawyer Roman Polanski once again appealed to Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), resigning prosecutions against his client, currently allocated to residence in Switzerland for a deadly affair over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the Pianist, pronounced before three judges of the Appeal Court in the second district of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the withdrawal of charges here and now, Mr. Hummel said, before he added that the judge's behavior at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who died since -- would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserves the prison -- which is a serious fault in the process.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lyed" to the author of the documentary.
If the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel appealed for a trial, which would allow him to present evidence of his argument.
The accusation has repeated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously examined as long as Roman Polanski would not stand before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old.
He has never put his feet back to the United States since.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County Phyllis Asayama said that Roman Polanski "has to be here to attend the hearing."
In this case, is the message to be sent, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "is asking for a favor to the court, while despising its authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also emphasized that there were other alternatives to escape.
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the resignation of prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s attorney, the victim, also called for the end of the prosecution once again.
Recalling that his client no longer supports being harassed at each rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
“Twenty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, waiting for a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 65,67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the Nasdaq, the technologically dominant, has left 0.55 points to 2.190,31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of exchanges has become very low, and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "aid to improve the market opinion on the solidity of economic recovery," said Charles Schwab analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month of affiliation and much more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence increased significantly in December, at 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indexes have been braked by a new growth in the dollar, at the top of two months in front of the euro, which “slows down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick from the Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost the field.
The obligatory market has fallen.
The revenue of the Treasury's good at 10 years increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% Wednesday evening and the good at 30 years at 4.497% compared to 4.492% at night.
Miss World Elections Again in South Africa
After a month’s journey across South Africa, 112 Miss Monde candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion spectators.
At this great beauty fair organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already deducted their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sportive or or Miss top model during their African stay.
This was a real bullshit.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape was extraordinary.
I have seen lots of things and have lived so many experiences!, declares Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is retransmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I’m happy to have experienced it twice,” Miss Monde Ksenia Sukhinova stressed in the warmth of the Southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "speaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, repetitions, meetings with the press and safari, the Misss are now focusing on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming the stars of Bollywood.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it is not just the appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launch Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will point this 59th edition.
Candidates will go out in traditional costume and of course in bath shirts.
The show will be animated by a TV shower, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a commissioner of Miss Monde Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that she was able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to equate, says Julia Morley, President of Miss Monde.
Candidates did a safari last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time bicycled, and tasted local cuisine.
In exceptional fact, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma who struck their hand.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone notes.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the destiny draw in Cape (Southwest) for the World Cup of June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I visited people I never thought I could get closer.
I will definitely come back to the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," said his son David on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport where he had to go to his father's head for several days.
The news is very positive.
It is very strong, it goes very well, said David Hallyday to the press at his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he was going to go "very fast" to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection consecutive to the operation of a discal hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer was “placed in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors of the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection consequent to the operation of a discal hernia in Paris on November 26.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade was schooled to attend a school show, a photographer from the AFP found.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the hospital of the Pitié-Salpétrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would go to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told that it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outwards, Camus said.
I’ve heard about a future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was "leaving too quickly to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I had this online doctor personally who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was surprised me, since I had myself two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "partie without drain, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also had surgery for actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematome as a result of a brain bleeding.
But he is also a physician with sulfide reputation, convicted several times by justice, in medical matters, as well as for tax fraud and scrolling.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scrupulous" pursued "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "alone from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux expressed himself Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well-developed" and that the post-operative exams were "normal".
The operation “was not bleeding and therefore did not require the placement of a drain,” he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since this summer, seems to be among parentheses.
Obviously, a resuming of the tour on January 8 (to Amiens, ndlr) as expected, it seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF Association raises the tone and sums the New Center to no longer use its sigle
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, responded Friday to the OPA attempt by the New Centre's president, Hervé Morin, on the seal of the former Giscardian party, encouraging him to no longer use it on any support, under the penalty of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, judged that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after pushing his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to support his approach, he received the support of the MEP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claims ownership of the brand UDF for being the first to file it to the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF’s office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who don’t want to leave, is out of his silence to launch a retreat to the minister and the MP, suming them to no longer use the seal and transmit the property of the brand, under the penalty of judicial proceedings.
You have multiplied, in the last days, the statements indicating that you are going to propose to your political movement of +recapture+ the UDF seal, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also thought it good to follow on your militant hardware and on your site’s guard page, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the today’s UDF slogan +l’UDF+, also find the email signatures.
As you don’t know, you have no right to use this seal, explains the UDF’s office that continues the NC to remove “immediately the name of the UDF from any support as well as from (son) website”.
He also asks Hervé de Charette to "transmit the property of (la) brand to its legitimate rights".
If you did not, the courts would be taken to comply with the law and legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they stated that the UDF "is a whole political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Center has no right to use the UDF seal (Union for French Democracy).
They also recalled that the UDF's last congress voted for its three-year accession to the MoDem in 2007 and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continued, "when he filed the brand", he was not "more joining the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently uses the absence of deposit of the UDF acronyme to perform it on its behalf.
This indifference is being transformed into crime, they denounce, before ironising on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worth making a name by itself than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we do not have right."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be judged for misuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accused, he benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenaire to spoil a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be judged for misuse on 15 and 16 April 2010, a three-year jail punishment and 375,000 euros fine.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter collapsed while holding the rhines of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
But the 15th correction chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The principal heir and shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre park during the investigation.
Appointed doctors will have to report before 10 March 2010, notably if Liliane Bettencourt has been in a weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit it.
I'm going to talk to him about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer Me Georges Kiejman at the hearing.
On the other hand, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ attorney, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court’s decision.
This is an excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (M. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we need to protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s unique daughter has committed criminal prosecutions against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist all over, that she has been accused of having benefited for years of her mother’s weakness to get a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, master-life insurance contracts or table.
On the other hand, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to have been manipulated by the photographer, which she considers as a long-time friend.
While the court had to examine the admissibility of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' complaints sometimes turned to the big family debate on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt’s attorney reported three letters sent by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she deceives the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years?
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
On the other hand, Nanterre’s parquet once again considered that the complainant was unacceptable to act, and that more than one of the Tuteles judges refused to have the right to initiate a judicial protection procedure for her mother in recent days.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to act in justice, is not under protection and has no tutor.
Nobody else has to act in his place,” said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, representative of the public ministry.
The court finally decided that it would be pronounced once the trial took place on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
The Managing Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence would have been empty.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of the major companies towards its employees reminds the position of the companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make the employees join "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose on consumers the products thought by technicians.
By putting the customer in the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies in place... although the authoritarian attempt to impose unconnected products from customer preference factors regularly returns!
Demobilization of employees can lead to mortify demoralization.
Suicide in France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects particularly the frames.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, furthermore, economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE “requires from all stakeholders [...] a proactive approach and prospective vision”; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are completely contrary.
That is why we call on a management revolution that would be putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns in the same way as the customer.
All relevant usefulness of internal opinion investigations
Will internal opinion surveys – like the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – stimulate this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
First of all, because I have been able to find that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes to it, after many deviations, to do priority... what it has always done!
Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplist vision of human behavior.
Based on major engineering schools, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reacted by the “neuroscience” of the U.S. and widely diffused by the Institutes of Studies and Media.
Thus, suggesting that the "levels" (sic) of the commitment of the frames are possible, a recent investigation of Ipsos in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a position of mechanical governance, inadequate to the world of today.
Identification and measurement of mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises assumes a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if this clearly appears as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions, projects.
Currently, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they consider their business based on a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and return their management of human resources “to the place”.
Thus they create a favourable ground for concerted development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: "right war" is worthy of praise to Obama
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed the speech spoken in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who had broke the award to Obama on October 9, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former Vice-President candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, wing of the right-wing of the Republican party, in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she had addressed herself the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memories that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing that Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, employed on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "very good work in Oslo."
I found that the speech was really good, and the former Chairman of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this historic speech, Gingrich, questioned during the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican investment for the 2012 presidential election, said it was delighted to have seen a "left president" reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they would not be free and could not give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former plum re-converts chronicler at the Washington Post, Obama pronounced "a very American speech".
In addition to appearing as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does,” he spoke as an American president, reminding the Europeans “that they live in a security ball that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the rare ones on the right to not be convinced, a fake of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "clean, ampouled and inspiration-free" on the National Review Online site.
At the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When the war is enclosed in the notion of justice, the massacre of innocents can be easily justified, he warned.
However, the central-left press remained lucky in the position of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, qualified his allocation of "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “must be used as a road sheet to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper said.
Obama "pronounced the speech he needed," the New York Times estimated, judgeing him "being both dark and constructive."
Routers: Three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road sector trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening ending the word of strike and the heavy threat to Christmas supply.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Transport Secretary of State, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoined" this agreement, after several negotiations sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left on Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And that even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had pushed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 p.m. to everyone agrees and to sign the text at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict would have been "very harmful for businesses" and "there was to be afraid it would come to disturb the end of the years," Mr. Bussereau said.
The text provides a 4% increase in salary for the lowest salary (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In time rate, for low wages, "we move from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but we’re leaving far away, Patrice Clos (FO).
We are going to order our militants that there are no blocks, no blocks of relief centers.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not satisfied, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "hard to convey increases on high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
This is the agreement of good sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed a "historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said he was "a acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for a revaluation of 3% travel costs, and the maintenance of road transport general status in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of €100 million of employee charges" was subject to a government amendment to the draft amending financial bill for 2009, voted on Friday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote for it "in the identical term".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply first to companies that are associated with this organization, and second to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "in the shortest time," Mr. Bussereau said.
The opposition of employer organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “dupe market” because the €100 million had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a portion of the carbon tax.
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but to not contrary the dishes eaters from the next awakening, the Unostra regretted.
For the other, the agreement is likely to "create the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unsatisfied trade unions with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP’s direction left them hungry on their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend before Christmas, there will be only trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to one on two trains on the central bank (between La Defense and Nation) and one on four trains outside the bank.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to change the train.
The Lafayette Gallerys, which await 200,000 customers every day, are pleased that "the RATP makes efforts to serve the major stores".
The RER A crosses the west is the Paris aggregation.
The RATP short trip from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train on two circulated at the top hours, and almost no copper in rough hours, as expected.
As of Thursday, there was no noise on which the French were organized.
Thus in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, particularly because of the absence of colleges and high school students.
At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained to rise "a thirty-hour earlier, to be sure to arrive at the time."
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said the SNCF, which had planned a framework of agents and forces of the order.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left from Saint-Lazare station to get to the metro.
New general meetings of grevists will take place on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "major" by the trade unions, of a meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career conduct, etc.
That’s not what drivers want, who demand a due prize, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals between parentheses, the CGT, underlined that the direction "wasn't sure to solve a problem while roads and SNCF did so."
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader examination of the profession's exercise conditions," the RATP said.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "smiled users of the weekend".
In the morning, about 150 drivers had invaded a seat committee in Paris.
It was then that the direction, who had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in a concern for calm."
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, after a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the degradation of the working conditions on this line to a million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, cover 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros premiums for delayed schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurd party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday pronounced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurd party, a decision immediately followed by anger manifestations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to complicate the government’s task, which has just stretched hand to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "four of activities that are harmful to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," President of the Court of Justice Hasim Kiliç said in the press, after four days of discussion.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to resolve the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party’s directors, including his President Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity benefited by Mrs. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the Party's Assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
His leaders had warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentary without labels.
The decision is followed by a 2007 proceeding launched by the Prosecutor of the Casation Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “directives” of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that he has "no organic connections" with the PKK but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him.
The Court’s judgment intervenes while the government has just stretched hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to stop the support of the Kurdish to the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said that a dissolution could lead to a recruiting of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where many protests against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan’s detention conditions have degenerated in strikes with police over the past few weeks.
From the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP’s premises in Diyarbakir, the large city of the southeast, mostly populated in Kurdish.
The forces of the order fired tears and used water canons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with fronts.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk affirmed that the decision of the Justice would "deep down the despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurd, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, he said.
The government, formed by a party derived from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closing of the parties.
This doesn’t solve anything,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torturing of the democratic openness launched by the government, the political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the most murderous in recent months.
First snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very strict winter.
But the responsible for the road cleaning and sailing service (FES) does not specify that it is not to disturb the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to control them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this could be good for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to fight snow and glass.
The FES follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as he begins to deny the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sailing vehicles run through 20 main routes (called routes A) .
This includes high-circuit streets, main arteries, such as the New Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
There are also firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and pedestrian streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES agents start their service at 3am in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of veil must be salted with a well-adhesive road for a maximum time of 3 hours.
That’s why the ESF service starts at 3 a.m. so that roads are released when the daily migration traffic begins.
There or it becomes more difficult, it's when the snow starts falling at 7:30 in the morning.
This causes problems, the manager of the road cleaning and sailing service told us, “because no driver is willing to let sailing vehicles pass.”
Then, if it no longer snow, you will take care of access routes and dessert routes - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary roads and sideways come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this still causes a few complaints.
At five o’clock in the morning, the ESF’s pedestrian team starts to prioritize dangerous areas and passages.
As for cycling tracks, the ESF services are usually not able to deal with it.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the status of the bridges between 22 hours and 4:30 p.m.
As the glass forms very quickly on these surfaces, sailing vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police are calling for this special service in need.
The Bears of Dinosaurs
The Tawa Hallae looked like other carnivor dinosaurs: this bipede measured about 2 metres long for 1.50m high, its rear members were powerful, its stretched neck was filled with accreated teeth and recurved, its short arms ended with faucet griffs and he had a long curve.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas to Austin and his colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine, Tawa Hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, Pangea, and was to the Ecuador.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
In fact, it informs us about the relatives’ links, the distribution and characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt conducted searches with other paleontologists, on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis from the Utah Natural History Museum and a member of the search team tells them that he sometimes came to find a dozen bones in a day that is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The searches have updated the remains of five samples.
A discovery that confirms the theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers baptized him by the name Tawa according to the word of the Indians Hopi for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: the dinosaurs fossils from Trias are extremely rare and are limited to some fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander at the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but it specifies that it allows to confirm certain theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, which makes the classification of all the first dinosaurs very difficult.
Experts wonder, among others, at what time the Saudis were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropodes (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the biciraptor appeared later and whose birds descended, the sauropodes, the quads of the long neck, and those whose species are partial and the ornitheous herbivores.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found evidence that the Tawa Hallae had small air bags in his bones at the head level, as well as the birds that are the descendants of the theropodes.
These small air pockets facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa Hallae, the vertebras were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the apparent line of the immense sauropods also had airbags and a light bone, it can be thought that their common ancestors already had this beneficial innovation.
Three consecutive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers concluded that the Saurians were there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution were divided and distributed from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging lands that form the Pangean supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, researchers say.
Alan Turner from the New York Natural History Museum and co-author of the magazine Science Studies said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course there are a few contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist at Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaurus, who lived in Poland and belongs to a group belonging to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong vision because in South America there are a large number of dinosaurs fossils that have been preserved while virtually none of them are found on other continents.
On the contrary, how the dinosaurs have managed to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary era while they were proven by a relatively rare collateral line of the branch of the reptiles, still remains a mystery today.
During the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of current crocodiles and many other Saurians.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, apparent to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
However, such success is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction in which the dinosaurs had survived randomly while other reptiles had disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better suited, so they could eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite developed a group of animals that also developed during the Trias and that since then was in the shadow: it was mammals.
The Solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories around the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are classes at the University of Naples, Québec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police from the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves across the globe.
278 teachers and teachers at J.W. Goethe University but also other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe, and North and South America express their solidarity with Protestant students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the board of directors of the university.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the strike after walls and works of art had been barbed by graffiti.
Five students were injured during evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify “a violent intervention by the police command against students and teachers who had organized their own courses.”
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable achievement" to freedom of research and education.
Focusing exclusively on the acts of vandalism serves only as "elegitizing and criminalizing protest" and trying to forget the reasons for mobilization.
Thus, the University’s Directorate Committee underwent debates that would still be essential.
Course officers require criminal proceedings to be suspended immediately.
Most occupants did not participate in degradations.
Legitimation of protests
The youths of the Verdi Trade Union and the German Confederation of the Trade Union (DGB) show themselves solidarity with students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretary of youth of the Verdi trade unions.
With regard to Hesse Land Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took and caused the action committed by the University President and police.
Thank you to the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the locations is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the current hour television broadcast.
We understand the meaning of protests, but we do not accept vandalism, regional Parliamentary Deputy Peter Beuth said.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (die Left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler from the Left Party.
Instead of thinking about students’ arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party filed a motion summarizing the Interior Minister to report on the conditions of police intervention.
The New Silicon-Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret weapon search site, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has a reputation to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are implanted there.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established connections with Riedberg, the place of Frankfurt Sciences – with the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a “Protocol of close collaboration” on Wednesday.
The signatories were Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Mayor Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Example
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific societies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutions and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the major Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literary translation "Green City") draws its name from forested hills in the heart of which research centres are implanted.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
It is not possible to place the size of the Stuttgart 21 project quite high.
For his supporters, this is nothing less than “new heart of Europe.”
The S21 is much more than the invasion of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will blow the heart of the capital of Bade-Wurtemberg, in a desperate chaos of chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the mind of the 1980s.
The main line stations, with roads ending in the city, had a reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th-century transport technology that made the sabotage effect of modern rail traffic as it once took a lot of time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, starting – that’s what you need to do.
This is why the main line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train passing station, which is about halfway on the TransEuropean Rail Magistrale between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "Europe's heart".
The implementation of the S21 project will really start, although the visions of the 1980s have been no longer compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost, to enter the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant.
Truely, the main line stations no longer have real entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with cars and pilot cars at both ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new trace of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken it.
The railway company is part because it is the taxpayer who charges the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From the urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get a urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the extension of the section are designed for trafficking of people to which - and it is typical of the 1980s - was a huge growth.
At that time there was no competition for cheap flights yet.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new trace, with its inclinations, is not suitable for cargo trains.
The S21, which is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engrossed in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of binding and binding in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport is listed in all sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhin Valley of 180 km.
Since 1987, this line has been constructed slowly.
It would be really urgent to push down here on the fungus.
But the S21 project makes the effect of a brake sabot.
The route of the Rhin Valley is on the way to become the gout of the outbreak of international goods traffic, which is in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport
In the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the Land discussed the possibility of appealing to the Hesse Administrative Tribunal judgment on the ban on night airflights.
Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had the responsibility of experts to examine from the legal point of view the judgment issued by the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the ban on night flights in the case or the construction project of the northwest landing trail at Frankfurt Airport would be carried out.
The permission to delay for 17 aircraft between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., such as the Land government’s review, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air damage.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if she wishes to make a case case against the judgment issued.
The opposition criticized this deadline and attempted to press the government’s representative to cede the appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of banning night flights. Otherwise, this will be convicted as a total lack of a given word.
It is sacredly difficult to be permitted to keep his word, said the Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir by altering the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch rejects Schäfer-Gümbel’s reproach claiming that the country’s government is trying to authorize night flights by using “avocateries and rubblardises”.
It takes time to carry out a precise legal examination.
The coalition does not want to make decisions on the basis of a “first quick impression”.
The decision must be legally reliable, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of his fraction on the ban on night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. Banks Refunded Aid
The big U.S. banks, very affected by the crisis, are disrupted from their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully refunded $45 billion to the Treasury (more than €30 billion), corresponding to aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions seek to get rid of imposed restrictions, accompanied by the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses allocated to the manager as well as higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that reported to him $19 billion of expensive money.
The rest of the amount comes from the bank’s cashes that are well-filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday, Kenneth Lewis, Director-General of the Bank of America, expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution assumed its capabilities by purchasing the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank to the strongest of financial burden.
The Citigroup is also planning to acquire money on the financial markets in order to get rid of the state's turtle.
The U.S. Bank could thus launch a $20 billion capital increase from Thursday, the CNBC chain cited banking media.
Citigroup spokeswoman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had refunded the public funds they had gained.
Accelerated Election
Finally, everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the current chairman Nikolaus Brender’s head editor’s position by the German ZDF Chain Management Board, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wished to vote last night to carry out the nomination.
Peter Frey, who led ZDF's Berlin writer, was the greatest favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm – officially – the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness to not harm ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter’s candidate, needed 9 members of the Commission to vote.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the editing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but it had been rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had expressed themselves in favour of Brender's reconstitution and seven others had voted against, and Brender's resignation by vote was a predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already left to hear several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his position.
This is Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of Hesse, who had organized a league against the chief editor.
He had refused the contract of the highly regarded chief editor to be prolonged by invoking the fact that the ZDF's listening level of information was lowered under Brender.
That is why protests were still held, almost until the vote, burning the growing political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, even 35 public law experts were involved in the debate and thought Koch’s action was anti-constitutional.
But it wouldn't have worked for anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Political Sciences, Pedagogy and Roman Languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhinea-Palatinat radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German day of national scope).
In 1983, he became editor within the ZDF first in the journal "hour-journal" (today's journal).
Then his journey continued: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chef of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the head and representative of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimensual information issue presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then the head of the ZDF.
After Brender’s disgrace, while he was just elected a year’s journalist by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent to the Governing Council, the President of Rhineland-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the candidate’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political personalities members of the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's most likely successor, had been able to work with the Board of Directors by criticizing the committee in his decision to clear Brender.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the post of editor-in-chef without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect it without suspicion of placing a political party on the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal from left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial Success for Students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decide to show themselves more conciliative: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rector Conference, an agreement was established that the working conditions of the Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to end their studies.
In particular, they agreed to relieve the weight of the exams: a single exam should allow the selected study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload must be recovered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organizing more flexible common structural requirements for Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the students’ protests in June last year, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have constantly expressed the fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Every module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," you can read in a document of thirty pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, says that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, the deviations, which significantly harm the studyability, should be able to stop.
In addition, "studyability" should be, in the future, the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if you cannot avoid this feeling of dizziness that you sometimes feel in the choice of classes.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition estimates that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate fraud.
Students should "have the opportunity and the margin of work necessary to enable and promote the personal initiative."
The new regulation will cover access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 all cycles have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies across the federal territory that depend on the accreditation board established by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder so that they could be on the agencies so that the programmes would not be too charged and the examination regime would not be too strict.
In some Länder, specialized universities and higher schools have already been heard with their regional ministry to take appropriate measures.
The Rhine-Palatinate is the only country to have agreed to grant more means to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorials to strengthen educational orientation offices as well as examination offices and international relations service
Lands and universities plan a budget of 10 million euros for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wishes to submit an amendment to Parliament to the law on higher education institutions.
Following this, only one examination will be required to conclude its studies.
The organisation of studies should be more flexible, and it should be possible to ensure the recognition of notes from other higher education institutions and the access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will be considered.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition once again discussed the issue of study conditions in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Association of Socialist Students announced that he would like the organization of educational policy to no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of the Ministers and university directors.
Later after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little bit.
The future higher education graduates were supported by the President of the Directors Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The student experience is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK works on a joint reform project.
For the Association of Education and Sciences (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It requires the right and the possibility for each graduate to subscribe to a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW Management Committee, also asks the Länder to provide today’s Bachelor students, that there will be enough places for master studies and best possible studies.
Lands must therefore hire more classmates.
On the contrary, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than one note at the bottom of Herta Müller
It is by these words “Come to Germany and it’s beautiful, almost more control...” that begins a work of poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the experiences of a dissident who came to Germany who won freedom but lost his linguistic territory at the same time.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first German and English professor in Bucharest and then director of collection at a youth editorial house before he settled in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he was director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm Artist House in Frankfurt.
He talked a lot about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, the theme was "The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deforming mirror of your Securitate dossiers".
Seemly destabilized and disturbed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
Söllner received the German language award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests were insidiously started in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, “so someone who has not been able to resist attempts to intimidate security.”
The poet Werner Söllner is Walter (IM Walter).
Almost at the same time with the Nobel Prize honor for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary mixtures with the dictatorship mechanisms of power, the literary scene is broken down, and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abdomen and the base of a political system, based on police surveillance.
Werner Söllner is, as much as we can say, according to current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate dossier, IM Walter played a role, assures the literary specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He could have pulled it out of all the difficult situations at that time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The way Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however, the blindness of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spyers who had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of his own record.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and sometimes have had real names hidden last Sorin, Voicu and Walter’s loan names.
Unlike Germany, where the consultation of Stasi dossiers is a reliable process, the attitude towards the inheritance of the Security dossiers is still very confused.
Systematic lighting has been constantly overloaded and braked over the past few years.
Only in 1999 was established a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the refund of the dossiers has rather been traced since.
Since 2005, there is a law that defines the management of archives.
If the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very large, it is confirmed by an interview by a former Temesvar Security officer who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself deeply devoted to the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end, she was only questioned once.
The infamousness of power was thought to be expressed here, without any gene, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case as this occurs so often in a hidden context of guilt.
Why now? Who was spoiled? The weighted reaction of the auditors, in the eye of Söllner, let hope that the following chapter will be more defined by a thirst to know than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, who won the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Tumultes in the Champions League
It was the impression that a representative arrived there, shot at four corners from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting item manufacturer had stitched his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross rose at midnight less than a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just called, a handbag of orange supplier.
The man whose thigh draws his attention, let him go into the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise, our 50-year-old could have taken the wheel – he didn’t drink alcohol and he wasn’t too happy.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to go back to work.
Because it's now that it's going to start.
The Swiss words that were just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we should not let us blind with success. It will be a brutal fight to not go back."
The “great work” is waiting for us on Sunday.
There, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League everyday.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after Marica's three shipping goals (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Tirage to the Destiny
The eighth final of the Champions League (match going 16./17. + 23./24 February/back match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be held in Nyon on December 18.
The joy of the entry as a fulminant function of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And joy was not moderate only in those who had been lucky, who had been transmitted to destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a faultless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "Plombier of Souls" - the recipe of success that sounded so much that it no longer had effects with the nurse Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, granddaughter Jens Lehmann, a supporter of Babbel, "in football when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that we would never believe possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for injury, advanced in the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamicism, tried to describe the phenomenon detected by a “fresh wind” proverbial and the new chief’s working method: “It’s someone who moves into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the head, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs mainly strength.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are committed to overevaluating the victory against a completely overwhelmed and weakened defence of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later had a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had well achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away from it.
We haven't passed the hard head yet.
That Heldt on his 40th anniversary day did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory for three months, is from the weekend events that a television interview by the target guard Jens Lehmann made to rebound just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, would Heldt, in response to Lehmann's close criticism.
He had accused the direction of style weakness and said she had decided to change the coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann had also considered a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been removed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness” by Heldt and announced the consequences for the target guard.
They no longer risk becoming friends for the life of these two 40 years.
In every cast, they agreed for the rest, i.e., that without the group's pre-work by the coach replaced, strong sporting and combating representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “a lot of success,” Heldt and Lehmann returned in choir – and even the man with a plastic bag acquired.
World Heavy Weight Championships
Warm fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson was constantly provoking him verbally and gestually the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds, Ukraine defended its title as the world champion of heavy weights according to the version of the WBC Federation.
By the unanimity of the judges, it was imposed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains his title as the world champion of heavy weights.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night, the 38-year-old champion had won a victory at the unity of judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko defends his title with honour since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine had won twice the WBO and WBC World Championship title.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in so much expectation.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, has doubled his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson has accepted his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, before 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the battle, from its 2.02 meters high, by its left.
Johnson, a younger of 11 centimeters, who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's hits, thus empowering Klitschko to get into play against the right-wing.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his strikes rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, having crossed the distance of the 12 rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko to treat him as a "villy zombie" who "is not really capable."
During the Friday weight, the champion couldn’t stop provoking Johnson by causing him to fall his nose sunglasses “to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has resumed his fourth battle since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After almost four years of pause, he had hit Nigerian Samuel Peter at the time in Berlin and recovered "sa" WBC belt that he had previously had to abandon without fighting.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just hit this battle and I’m in perfect shape,” said Klitschko to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to gather the four most important titles in the family.
Her brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having destroyed the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Hague had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was supposed to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is planning to play this game at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The case of Kunduz
The front attack of the opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lies in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Left parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's air strike, the opposition opposed the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) to deliberately depict some facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-very" on the murder of two tank trucks in September last, the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said Saturday during the information issue of the ARD chain "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he has lied.
The murder order was given to the total negligence of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the report that NATO has and was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the lap was actually not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two major Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the U.S. air strike that had been launched at the request of Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to pronounce themselves as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast Party believe that Mrs Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan government's policy if the Chancellor, the army and the information services have approved this new strategy.
The Government’s spokeswoman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellor has in no way influenced the military's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doubts about the real reasons for the return of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as it had been presented by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL journal, the information they had provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack of tank trucks was both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have dissimulated the existence of the NATO report and hid some disturbing details to the Minister.
In the surroundings of the two senior officials, however, they were told to the Ministry of Defense that several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein and a military police report.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would have in the meantime requested an explanation of the facts in a letter.
Until now, he has not received a response
Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these charges and sent to the Federal Parliament Investigation Committee, which would form on Wednesday to bring light on the facts in question.
The Worlds of Dreams
Some people see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
There is not only in mental patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are extended into our dark rooms, we can worship without obstacles to the crazyest dreams and fantasies.
But whoever, awakened, experiences the state of dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in mental patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, but sometimes stimulates the limits between dream, madness and reality to fall.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect distinguish, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second state of the chamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or deliries when balance, brain neurotransmitter substances - first of all dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - break and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delicious thoughts are very often manifested during schizophrenic psychosis.
Earth attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always thought about the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imaginations, deliries and sensory illusions that compose it."
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T becomes a character of a drawing band.
His body is in two dimensions with grown colors.
Earth attraction no longer has power on him, he planes at the ceiling ray.
He feels a hit.
Behind him, the creatures of the devil wrapped, grim, the mouth bleeding, showing teeth.
They pursue him, give him foot strikes with heavy flaming boots, throw him to the walls, and he feels pain throughout his body.
Tonituring, evil, crying, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult him and humble him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from its stereo chain, in fact a screw and attachs it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and walks around his neck.
He's jumping.
The boucle is separated.
Let this serve you as a lesson, the voices in a choir shout to pull him off the tympan. "Go to a clinic and make yourself healed!"
Today, Henning T., aged 40, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is maniaco-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despairs.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About a percentage of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship folly or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbance signals, the consciousness is crushed under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the clues to a bunch of ideas and fantasies derived from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the CHU Department of Psychiatry in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum) .
Schizophrene is in the center of the situation, all with a focused meaning on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
This is why schizophrenes often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the ability to adjust reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience once in his life with a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delicious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, alienation of the living takes place in a real context.
Why our brain does this kind of cabrioles, is always an enigma for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to momentally lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinant factors.
Researchers assume that the people concerned have poor brain injuries.
The neuronal maturity of the brain is assumed to be disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way the abnormality of the neural system occurs and, in addition, the fact that it does not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, however, if there is predisposition.
Likewise, hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain is warming up.
What’s crazy, Lübeck’s psychologist Erich Kasten told us, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to defeat them while others buy very expensive drugs to buy them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of view.
Kasten has for ten years gathered reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusionary images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The irreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are largely part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to find that in some conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They form when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not cold enough; when our brain warms up, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of the participants acknowledged that they had done a hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K., aged 16, lives in a small town in former Mecklembourg-Pomérania and goes to high school.
A young girl is doing it normal to say the truth.
If there were no pictures and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long shady hair, addresses him the word.
When she responds to her companions, she looks at her – nobody else can see or hear that boy.
They think that this timid girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
She can even perceive her presence at the moment.
It's a nice feeling, she finds that young boy friendly.
I'm crazy, sometimes she wonders.
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
The appearances at night are generally frightening.
The visions are often weighty.
When she is in class, it happens that she can’t follow the course because the professor is just presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the professor is obviously explaining equations in the table.
The appearances at night are generally frightening.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for the sleep that arrives too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is awake or already dream, if the images she sees, screwed faces or the girl with bloody insights on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Let me be quiet, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn’t talk to her parents or friends, they would take her for a crazy thing.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She had her bag last year and she lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she entered the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Crazy is also an artwork of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, it is likely that he has hallucinations after a certain time.
I suppose that the brain is not busy enough, making sure that there is animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played all alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was in the age of thinking, was not her true father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, so they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not fundamentally distinguish themselves from those in acute psychoses.
Contrary to schizophrenes, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to love hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, there is a rapid tendency to take imaginary pathologies experiences, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the Florence Nightingale Hospital’s psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but also contains something positive, creative - crazy is an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called onyroid experience, a particular form of the change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Onyroid vecus are very complex semiconductor dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot distinguish from dream even when he is awake.
The state of consciousness manifests during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies, such as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience a motor paralyzation.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of itself and of the world, due to a total and sustainable incapacity to move, he replaces the real situation that affects his life by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a mental limit state between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world takes place but the real situation is represented in imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerant situation, an organizational capacity that is given to us, human beings, so as not to fall into the ignorance of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Zurichist Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changement of the Heart" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his conscious part for a journey of several days after the surgery of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time his body is condemned to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen blows into a world that he created from all rooms, visits foreign places, travels over time. He is seen as an elderly man in a railroad sanatorium, a robot with his head guarding his health.
He lives in the middle age among nobles producing blood-based drugs.
He is taken away by a bicycled Greek who takes him to his country, surfers with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It absorbs itself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these internal travels differ fundamentally from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes by describing what he has experienced.
Contrary to dreams, memories from mental journeys are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this life makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, deliries onyroids, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our internal representations of external reality are even in a state of warning.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes, “may cause a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that can be quite enriching as well.

Burda
At the age of 27, children will follow the editorial house.
Kallen’s appointment as Burda’s CEO is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take the press group back, he said in the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family company.
Hamburg - In the long run, editor Hubert Burda sees his society in the hands of his children
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to integrate the company, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda at Spiegel.
All details have been adjusted in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be asked later.
You will also need to see if they are able to do so.
We cannot impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to deal with it.
This would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the office of President-General from January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the Treasury sector, which means he was responsible for the company’s capital, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s departure, he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a family member who is headed by the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda stated that the holding must remain 100% in the family’s hands.
Ruins have always occurred in families that have been trained by a burning capital, which have made huge disastrous speculations by thinking that they could climb increasingly.
This has never been my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the country’s predecessor as Springer could be, and I don’t intend to be part of these international leagues like the Time, these companies have taken too much importance.

Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
His director assures that 15 minutes (heating and extraction included) are enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after making our body work, we want to pass through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi teaching has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, brightness or nutrition, the whole customized.
Innovation and exclusiveness appear to have been the words of this urban spa, which will be opened every day of the year from 10h to 22h.
Variety decollections
Christmas approaches and it’s never overwhelming to study the look of the stars to adapt to our wedding dress.
The shape of decollecting, which is very important to emphasize the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated decomposition. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona are equipped with electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, created the “Office LIVE”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the capital of Catalonia.
The “Office LIVE” (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road sheet for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle in the city and will implement agreements on mobility, by taking steps, coordinating, subsidying, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will become the transportation of the future.
3 “Electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in European standardization groups and has an ongoing set of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero Interviews “A Future of Peace” for the Motor Industry
President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, interviewed “a future of tranquillity” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, we would have had a landscape today to resign, close some of our main production sites,” the President of the Government said.
“With this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Competitiveness Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has spent €800 million on 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilised an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Executive Director explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized the government’s demand support measures, in accordance with Plan 2000E, established in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the Chairman, this plan helped reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "smart increase" of registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m2 collection cars
Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Salon of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and the passionates of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Cristal Pabellón de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitions will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and collecting cars there, but also can we find items in ClassicAuto Madrid of any kind related to the world of the engine.
Thus, in the flag exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among other things, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
External Aptitude Test
But the commercial activity of this salon will also include parallel activities: meetings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Ability tests with cars and collecting motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sports Spirit
Mazda wants to prove that sports spirit is not angry with respect to the environment.
For this purpose, it has just been integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start-up system, called i-Stop, a device that is currently only available on the engine 2.0 with 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, housing, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fixation.
The touching of the wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and the console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the soberness of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
By continuing with the chamber, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All this adds a large box to regular forms.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-liter and 150-hoved engine with a manual change of six-speed speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanding Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not perform a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the selected model for the test is the Sportive, otherwise said, which presents the largest number of series elements.
Among the series equipment, the road change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, photo-sensible interior mirror, board computer on a large screen, blue screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, bluetooth as well as rainlight and light sensors
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which, for €1,500 more, includes, among other things, the adaptable two-second lights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, its behavior and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not perform a lot of kilometres per year will only be able to choose the i-Stop version associated with the 2.0-150 horse-driven engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between €21,770 for Luxury finish and €23,270 for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return, Mazda3 will offer us a large amount of satisfaction every day.
“First” of luxury

Our "Pe", so sophisticated as usual, had chosen for a dark lady.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it’s a device that only allows you to watch your email, without offering the possibility to only see some kind of attachments or browse on the Internet.
He benefited from his five minutes of glory in the United States, when the Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low monthly price and subscription, or less than half of what costs, for example, iPhone data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free live data service, six times more expensive than Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately searching for a cafe on the Wifi (or Fon connection) to be able to see its email.
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it has long been supposed to work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but with regard to me, I should have made a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
Repeated recalls to the European Commission's order to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a hardly noticeable effect.
Outside of its country of origin, the data is used, and it is not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to profitize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes the download of books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and we pay it when purchased, not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already offers in the United States.
I don't want to buy it.
I'm looking at my email on my phone, thank you.
I just wish it because I believe it is a more fair formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady in the United States.
If she took the office of Barack Obama in the US presidency with a dress and a cloak of this color, she has actually chosen the same to accompany it in the second moment, without doubt, the most important of her life: award to Oslo the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama weared a very similar model in these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow drawing to the green with bright reflections, twice the dress consists of three pieces: the shirt, the shirt and the shirt, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large broderie or a necklace.
Although at first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the seal of the Princess of the Asturias and chose to put the same clothes back.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick tooth, however, it brought a printed velour to Oslo.
Accessories are also different: green shoes with medium tile for the first time, and a similar model, but gold, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted while wearing them released once before.
75% of mothers who work had professional problems due to their maternity
Labour discrimination has increased over the past few years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what reveals the study “Feminity and professional career of women in Spain”, conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institut de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no place in doubt: 75% of the mothers working have seen their professional career limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of couple life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of occupied employment.
Those who do not have activities outside of the home, work part-time or have a little stable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, reject entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after having been coupled. This figure is up to 4.1 in those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to reject the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised has a large influence on maternity, but less the date of starting common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that increases the gap of the age of women's marriage and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child late.
The difference is also between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who conducted primary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years of age.
“A different dispute also occurs among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who conducted elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who conducted medieval or higher-level studies invert this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for a child's marriage and arrival," said Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
The Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will incarn the image of several products of the brand, surprisingly the universal currency "Because I value it well."
The protagonist of Joyeux Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, comes to join other celebrities recorded at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
In men, the brand of cosmetics also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the evangelical companion in Lost).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, met for the annual award, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Ex-mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Mannequin of the year.
The poker of Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de Ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty "radiography" of writers who have passed his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does it not according to the predictable and perceived genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the innition of the character created.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not save either the fears or the lighting.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an exciting invitation to read and reread.
I'll leave you here a few moments.
Albert Camus: “In his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical pulse, which I felt without name: the pleasure of the funest destiny, morality without guilt and innocentness without any god.”
Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, a algerian Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between impunity and ignorance, with a blowing poetic humour, deprived of sense, like the blade of the knife that failed to kill him.”
Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjugated the emotion of the adulterer to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching the sky through the path of perdition.”
James Joyce: "The Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the tops of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be recorded by the northern face, on which the best alpinists are still and still taken."
William Faulkner: “It was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said he was the heir of a county land owner and other times he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
Louis-Ferdinand Céline: “This writer collected the cries pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to wear his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and did it in the escape of himself and invoking the postteriority with a violent speech to the asticous.”
Dorothy Parker said: “One day she knelt down and prayed: ‘Dear God, I beg you to stop writing as a woman.’”
Joseph Conrad: “On his tomb were grabbed to Spenser’s verses: ‘Sleep after effort,/ After storm the port,/ Rest after war,/ After life, tired of the death.’”
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also transported her depression.
Her husband was very normally accepting that she told him that Edward VII was spitting him between the azalees or that birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeded the madness.”
Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn’t trying to dissimulate Joyce at Baroja?
What was Benet trying if it wasn't to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What if this does not aspire to the glory of this man, that he may serve him as a piety?"
A dirty aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70, walked into our neighborhood of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed next to her and our dog, a blood-mole, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six pounds, and without saying words, they set him two wounded feet that laid him grey.
Our indignation is enormous because we do not see what is fun to assaulte for free a little animal without defence that, in addition, was left behind.
It is necessary to add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she injured these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, because an energy-powered animal that attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly, or, finally, any weaker person than he.
The episode took place around 17 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog has been gay all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the district's commissioner, even if we doubt that it serves as a great deal and not to touch the sensitivity, we just want to clarify that the killers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening in young people so that they find fun to abuse for free an unprotected animal that gives us love, friendship, and keeps us together.
We don’t know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the casket
The manufacturer of tires Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the younger motorcyclers, as the two structures indicated today.
The objective of this initiative is to make awareness of the importance of carrying the helmet, as it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin said that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “go beyond the design and manufacturing of products increasingly safer” and claimed that it contributed to this objective by other educational and informatic actions.
This new two-wheeled supporting campaign, under the currency "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posts will be distributed into more than 500 motorcycle garages to ensure the broadest distribution of it.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is a constant concern for the company, because as a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles grows
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures of the employer trade unions of the manufacturers of Anfac and Ganvam.
However, the good news should be noted, since the reference to the comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the rebound of last month, the records accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles that are included in the category of light commercial vehicles (tourist car derivatives, pick-up, trucks, light furniture and light chassis trucks) were sold 95 853.
The large clouds that affect the most demand have not been dissipated; although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external funding.
In addition to the restriction of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic context need to be added.
In the face of this situation and in contrast to tourism vehicles, 2000E purchase aid has not been used.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who want to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, they can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks of themselves.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was recalled the need for administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Traders envisages a 2010 year similar to that that ends, for which it calculates a 19% decline in sales (tourism vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As this took place with the ABS brake anti-blocking system and as this will take place with ESP stability control, emergency brake aid systems will constitute a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for newly registered tourist vehicles and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a shortage period was established by the end of February 2011.
The measures imposed by the European Union are aimed at strengthening the protection of pedestrians, although by its means of action it can also contribute to avoiding many retreat shocks.
The emergency brake assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of emergency detected by the system thanks to the foot strike given by the driver.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to push the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all its strength.
Up to 1100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 deadly accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided every year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called smart emergency brake systems: it is calculated that a disaster in four with wounded would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver from acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exercises the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors resumed Opel plan until January
While the workers of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Saragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has concluded that it will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, we are assured that a decision on Saab’s sales should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has pushed the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them might be Geely, who also seeks to acquire Volvo, but the candidate for the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is important.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a portion of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
In order to design their last and precious jewelry, Porsche engineers have left the Boxster S and managed to make it out of nothing less than 80 pounds, leaving the balance just 1 275 pounds.
This led them to pass, first of all, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manually washed roof, allowing to reduce 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioning, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 kilos, and to winning 7 kilos.
Finally, they abandoned the CDR-30 audio system, thus winning six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with tissue handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double embracing PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on the highways of California’s secondary network, in the mountain, with particularly tortuous rotations.
Its behavior can only be qualified as irreproachable.
Weight reduction does not prevent the car from driving on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary, it has long been that we have not tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time guarantees as much safety in the wires, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at a small speed during the time needed, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover, and push his engine again.
That's what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as communicative as precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she will do it with surgical accuracy.
The sound of the engine at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the “sport” option or with a system that alters the engine spinning, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at the stop or when recovering.
Suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite broken, but the car managed well the chicken nides.
The electronic assistants barely made the presence on the whole journey, while on some rotations we found glass in the morning and graviers, later in the morning.
Finally, an ultralight car, more fun to drive and which is much more than a simple change of the Boxster S.
The car will be sold in February 2010 at a price of €70,831.
" Bag Girl "
Karl Lagerfeld’s intimate friend, icon of Coco Coco Coco line and occasional starlette of the house’s squads, the singer shows her face of a bad girl with as much content as Chanel’s bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or "It Girl" is a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral has gained a triumph of 91-82 during his visit to the hard field of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences of Dusko Ivanovic's team. This is where she is headed by her group, after Mirza Teletovic's great spectacle, which, with eight three-point baskets, was the best of her team.
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the important abuses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of collective engagement and work, even though she had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets marked three points, largely determined the final victory.
The match began quickly for the blue and red, which took the advantage from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked since the perimeter, presumed they had jumped on the Israeli ground with the hot ponds.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter time.
The second-quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose Barac’s internal game and the work of Eliahu, which was received by acclamations and applause to return to his old home, to increase their advantage to the pause (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 scores, although Splitter's "less six" evaluation had already predicted that that night would not be the best of Brazilian.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right path to the pause, nothing was played, far from there, and the team of Avala wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn’t win so easily on their field, and thanks to “Elias’ hand,” they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
Ivanovic’s players, injured but not dead, had to chain some skillful action to take the air, and at that time Mirza Teletovic’s mitraillette, which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas, gave the counter to a successful score (English and Ribas) and Ribas gave the counter to a final score (54-67).
Avala's team came out to play all over the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they wouldn't let anyone take what they had earned for the first 30 minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support it from the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, Ivanovic’s players did not hurry, defended well, and although the Israelis had approached in the last minute (80-85), the match was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injury prevents Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost in Greece to the Olympics and gave him the head of the Euroligue Group B during a match marked by the absences of the Unicaja players, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship flag or by the rival's envelopment, probably one of Europe's most powerful and with a large budget.
The first quarter-time game allowed the Andalusians to dream. A aggressive defense and three-consecutive three-point baskets, two of manager Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who locked the local team 12-18 in the ninth minute.
The Olympics were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis allowed to reverse the score 22-20 at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of breaking, between the American managers Beverley and Williams blocked.
The Greek team began working by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury to the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on the Unicaja.
Indoor players and Lithuanian ailier Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, grew the advantage 44-32 at the nineteenth minute.
An Impossible Release
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympics, which, despite the 19 losses, appeared higher and even equated the difference of the disputed encounter in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chancellor.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last outlet of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, Unicaja, thanks to its organization, to Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left a bit of hope with 66-57, in the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympics proved implacable when the players made pressure and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to rise the score to 81-62 in the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submits, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new Trovit application, the search engine with the largest number of smaller real estate ads, employment and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you pay?" tool calculates the salary of users from over 140,000 jobs offered by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, age and the city you want to work.
For a week since the application has been working, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker “feel badly paid,” said Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera in a statement.
According to the data provided by Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spanish are the least paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 annual gross euros and a French 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000 euros.
In the same way, a driver receives 34,247 annual gross euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid work in Spain is that of the server, with €11,592 nets annually, followed by the seller, with €14,725, and the worker, with €15,667.
The most searched jobs on the Internet over the past three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil fixes a date for departure from Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The reversed president will have to leave the diplomatic league by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, businessman of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee from September 21 before that date.
He is aware that he must leave on January 27, after his mandate, he must seek another destination.
The chain also cited the former mandate, who confirmed her intention to leave the embassy before the end of the set time: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the 29 November elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the political exile condition that he intended to impose the government of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you so much.
After pink days since last spring, during which the inflation of assets has been the dominant note on the markets, uncertainty again emerges, which is not surprising because it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on a future by uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt by direct asset purchase and indirectly giving abundant liquidity at zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct asset purchases have been practically completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, they begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their tender to one year of the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the global economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are assisting in a reverse of the risk premium reduction.
The volatility of scholarships and corporate bond deviations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize the private risk and public debt is re-influenced.
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refugees chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but Standard & Poor'sa was then threatened by a new revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence moral risk defenders, who were trying to again to cause a case of awareness among global economic policy officials who had brake the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to decree a new day.
However, the situation of Dubai looks like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to return its place to power in the Emirs, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissimiles a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pink pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin would save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area to not comply with its commitments.
What, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has incited the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excess in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our derogations from public debt increase with the extent of European corporate obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European gaps declined and ours continued to increase, it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The case Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our predictive indicators oblige most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to increase their 2011 forecasts, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not have much hope for them.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment “caution is a mother of certainty”.
Connected sectors
Iberdrola’s President, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the Deputy Congress subcommittee, where Spain’s energy strategy is discussed these days for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán, exclaimed for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, at eight-clos.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros by 2020 and 60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in the event that nuclear power plants are still in operation today.
If that is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 950,000.
On the contrary, Iberdola believes that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increased production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change, and it will need to increase power.
Its wager focuses both on gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this field, he considers that more 18,000 MW are needed, with other “support energy”.
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in the line of what its business claims, did not wish to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts climate warming policies.
According to him, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “punctual” measures, as they were qualified by the President of Iberdrola.
In any case, Galán believes that the decisions to invest, although they are located in the long term, may begin to be taken, since they take some time before reaching their maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Air Lingus management market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for land-based airport services, will play the role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for goods services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt, or Brussels are one of the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Board of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Innovation Centre.
The alliance plans an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will be from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out energy efficiency research on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concession highway in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The playground is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million Australian dollars (about $1,077 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the eastern coast, is the option to allow Acciona to reside in the country as a public work company and highway dealer.
The city’s mayor wants to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the workshop and exploitation of the peage.
In the expectation of their tenders to be presented in May next, the estimated investment is $1,700 million Australian dollars (about $1,077 million) and in the last phase three consortiums are facing, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is managed by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground work specialists.
Contrary to the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French constructor group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (from the German manufacturer Hochtief, who in turn has ACS participation), another local company, Baulderstone (own of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and the Gallus company, specialized in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large farms and privatisations, but entering it is a major difficulty if not by acquiring a local construction company.
A strategy followed by Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, which have already been mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, which remains an unvalid step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely gained a place on this market through its 30% participation in Hochtief, Leighton owner.
Millionaire assets
Acciona puts on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a wide presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalinization sector.
Assets include the largest wind park, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and manages the group of companies responsible for creating and managing the Adelaïde desalizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and to benefit from synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The pedestrian underground road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and called Northern Link (Northern Line), is called to connect Toowong's western highway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 km of tunnel. This is the largest project existing to reduce traffic in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place during the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.
Despite the fact that this pedestrian road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not planned to finish the workshop before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two-ways twice, an electronic pearing system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to widely fructifice Hochtief, which mentioned yesterday the acquisition of a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-flow fiber optical network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have fast Internet access and provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. The work has not yet started and Hochtief completed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, more precisely in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC can adjudicate a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is adjudicated to build a 2.1 kilometre-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract a few days after seeing himself responsible for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the workshop is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore can adjure Renfe's advertising
Renfe has entrusted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to Mrs Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two prolongations of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been selected from 16 agencies who have submitted to the offer call organized by Renfe, four of which have been finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to stop competition
The French Competition Regulator has imposed a fine of €63 million to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted competition on fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs beyond the regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and yet state-owned company has accumulated more than €450 million in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it imposes on its competitors.
The sanctions imposed yesterday have been increased as the competition-securing authority considers France Telecom to have committed similar crimes in the past and is therefore rediscovered.
A App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone subsidiary followed the seal of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange App Store will be active in France and the UK.
It will need to wait for 2010 to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for the clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, putting them in the third and fifth position of the clubs who made the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is on the list.
Manchester United is on the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income in the major clubs.
In fact, the competition has distributed €5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the establishment of the tournament during the 1992-1993 season, according to the information from UEFA.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for his participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
The Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, both teams who in addition paid the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions League, although it won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex process of distributing money applied by UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini’s chairmanship plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
From this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in the classification matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million only to be there, plus 550,00 euros for each contested match.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (EUR 800 000) and equality (EUR 400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive four million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.5 received by the other finalist.
As a result, for fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and up to 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments, to which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed based on the proportional value of each TV market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attracted places.
The champion of the previous year empowers 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid depending on the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the purchase of shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9 % of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige him to launch a public procurement bid (OPA) for the entire securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which will be paid in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this report.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa’s offer therefore evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of €1.50 reflects the actual rating of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of 15 consultants.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day period for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it had happened, the decay would be 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos would be 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible procurement offers and go and come to court from his former directors, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes it the first woman to take a lead position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the president of the group.
And it is not questionable, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged detouring of more than 230 million Sos to the Salazar companies.
In addition, the possibility that Sos will reveal new detours of funds over the next few months cannot be avoided.
With regard to Salazar credit, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the detour of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorises the Paternina Exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Value Market Commission (CNMV) authorized the OPA to exclude Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9th.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation as it understood that its terms were adapted to the existing standards and that it considered the contents of the document presented “suficient” as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which represents 8.95 % of the social capital, comprising 6,142,786 shares to be negotiated on the Madrid and Bilbao scholarships.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, and that they could in no way be transferred before the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars who have suffered a disaster are brought to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of pieces and working time can be a long and complex work.
Calculation of the cost of a repair between EUR 20,000 and EUR 30,000, including parts and workforce may take two or three hours.
On the contrary, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a question of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
The providers of services and solutions for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of the information provided by the manufacturers, to then process and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American Solera Group, is the leading company; 80% of estimates are made with its products.
Other companies in the field of evaluation and development of industry information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, but more versions, variants and motorisations have only been launched over the past fifteen years.
When a new car runs on the market, these companies start working.
This is a very hard work, because you need to catalog each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If it is a massively sold model, work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If this is a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
One of the most exclusive models, for example, is information about the Porsche, but not the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to vehicles in circulation, the number exceeds 99%.
To perform the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of cash parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide to detail about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support it can bring to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the light product is AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint frames.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75 for customers who use it at least ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiate its prize with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it has gone out of the assembly chain, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional Internet sector that allows you to lock on thickly declared vehicles.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analysis or knowing common problems per brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific brand went to the garage for a failure or how many serious accidents have suffered for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of such tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a service provider and disaster assessment, failure or maintenance solutions.
The GT evaluation guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20 percent per year over the last three years, and it has increased its business volume by 10.8 million euros in 2008.
In the beginning of last year, she started its internationalization process, with the establishment of a office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its revenue is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and 38% remaining in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global sales revenue (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, i.e. 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was awarded a stock exchange of $1,000 million, today its shares are estimated at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been next to the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Internet auctions of accidental cars
In October last, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation included a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could extend next year to 15% remaining.
The goal of the acquisition was to provide more value added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, warehouses and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and operates over 650 000 operations across Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently over 1,500 sellers and 4,000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the contrary, some parts that are not broken can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage offer
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a bid in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating a bid and generating it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who are more or less opposed to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism vehicles, 109 all-terrain vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 trucks and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and Internet connection are needed.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and selects the required piece.
The user may include variables such as the price of the workforce, increases or discounts, and then he may print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimate tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the garage-dedicated does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use of this garage tool is €350 per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the Audatex company works to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, as it will, for example, allow to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
