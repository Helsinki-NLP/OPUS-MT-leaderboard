Wells Assembly members are worried that they look like muppets
Part of the Members of the Assembly is considered to be amended by the proposal for their name to be "CUP" (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal has been provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the Wells Parliament.
Members of the entire political spectrum are worried that this can be a cause of laughter.
One of the labourists said his group was worried because the new name was "Roman with Dump and Vdlab."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, this is definitely insulting.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group “is not happy” and offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh Conservative Party said its group was “not condemned” to change the name, but noted that the new name of the CDP (MWP) had a certain verbal image with “muppet”.
In this context, the letter W is pronounced similar to the English yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which currently draws up the black text of the bill to change the name, made the following statement: “It is clear that the final decision for all descriptions called members of the Assembly will belong to the members themselves.”
The Wells Government Act of 2017 gave the Wells Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey on the proposals, establishing wide support for the Assembly to begin to be called the "Welt's Parliament".
As regards the role of its members, the Commission prefers “Welt’s parliamentary members, shortly called “CPU”, but the “CPU” option has received the highest support after an inquiry to the society.
Members of the Assembly offer alternative options, but reaching the consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, from which it is expected to submit the black draft for the amendment within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualifiing its members, as well as the design of the Commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on how they will be called when the bill is discussed.
Macedonians will vote on a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that the name of her northern neighbour is a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to her attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, opponent of a referendum on the change of the country's name, said he would not count the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that change in the country’s name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Cambodians Deployed in the Background of Church Difficulties in Harlem
“If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” said Adams.
“Today both disappeared.”
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“The people today are socializing in different ways,” he added.
“The bars are no longer the neighbourhoods where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not come for as long as the managers expect, "and they will be in the same position sooner or later".
The man adds that the churches can be replaced by blocks with apartments where people who don’t help survive the rest of the neighborhood’s sanctuary.
“The vast majority of people buying homes in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the closing process of these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlements will visit them.”
Both churches were built by white shepherds before Harlem became a Black Quarter – the Metropole Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist Passion emerged in the 1930s.
Then the building became the property of the black residents of the neighbourhood.
St. Martin was poetry by the Black Christians under the leadership of the predecessor John Howard Johnson, who organized the boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, because they did not want to hire black workers.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damages, but Father Johnson's enories made a plan for her restoration, where the cabins ordered.
David Johnson, the son of the father Johnson and the inheritance of St. Martin, is proud to call them the "poor cramps."
The expert, who used the cabins in July, has another description: “Cultural Treasure” and “Replaceable Historical Instrument”.
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Ngh from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the world's first mixture system that was used by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to the larger system in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Marywooder said it wasn't replaced by St. Martin.
What has been played in St. Martin in the last few weeks has been a complex story, carried out by architects and performers, some led by world leaders of the church, and some by the Bishop's.
From the veteran, which is the leading body of the pastoral, consisting of world leaders, wrote to the ephacy in July, expressing their concerns that the ephacy would “be inclined to transfer the costs of the veteran,” although he did not have a role in hiring the architects and executives.
Some enories have complained of the lack of transparency by the eparchy.
13-year-old child has been injured by an oomla hunt in California
Akula attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday, while it crashed for omers in California on the first day of the hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near the Beach of Bacon in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamle told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was killing friends about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and went in with a whole group to take him out of the water.
Haml first thought that the child caught the odor and was excited, then realized he shouted, “Heavy me!
You've got me!"
Hamle tells us that when he reached the boy, he realized that the entire area of his key was broken.
“I urged everyone to get out of the water because there’s an acne!” added Hamle.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the children's hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was adopted in a critical state.
It is not yet known which type of aqua is responsible for the attack.
The rescue captain Larry Gills said a few weeks earlier in the water had been noticed, but it was estimated that it was not dangerous.
Jills added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of her body.
The responsible authorities closed access to the coastline from the Ponto beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Enstitinas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation was running.
Gilis notes that there are more than 135 species of acne in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury plans to offend the UK market for decorative products
Sainsbury is facing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening shoes for decorative products in its facilities where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant decoration market offensive in the UK, which is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household products at the same time decrease, the largest stocks of decoration products will be placed in 11 stores across the country, after which the initiative will be opened in success.
The investment lock in the delightful industry is done at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on stars, recently used by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of decoration products offered up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Today's products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space like offers in Boots stores.
The supermarket also restarts its boutique range of makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly looking for younger users.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume dealer will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be discovered in Seli Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Marketing online and moving focus on buying smaller amounts of food every day in convenient moments leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more efforts to attract buyers.
Mike Coop, Chief Executive Officer of Sainsbury, shared that the objects will look more and more like universal stores while the supermarket chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl diskontries, offering more services and non-nutrition goods.
From Sainsbury, Argos has hundreds of stores, and they also open Habitats’ objects since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has increased the sales of food products and made the profits even more profitable.
The previous experience of the chain of supermarkets to refascinate its objects for decorative and pharmaceutical products has failed.
Sainsbury shared experience with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute about the distribution of the profits from the pharmaceutical company's facilities in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio’s ownership of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the nature and nature of our delightful stains to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We have also invested in special training to our colleagues, which will offer professional advice on-site.
The range of brands offered by us aims to respond to every taste and everything you need in a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for decorative products, which challenges the concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones is "good" after Holly Willey's refusal to deal for 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones “has invaded” after leading television Holly Willbee resigned from a £11 million deal with his Lifstail company to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willey doesn't have time for the brand of Truly household appliances and accessories.
The business of the couple is compared to the Goop brand of Guinnet Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of this morning announced his leave on Instagram.
Holly Willabi left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones to “kipe” after downloading from their income business with the brand’s lifestyle products in the last minute – focusing on their own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources share that Jones “has been invaded” when the gold girl” on television recognized during a pressing meeting on Tuesday at its business empire center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that Tru will no longer have time for her branding home products and accessories.
The business is similar to Guinnet Poltrow’s Goop brand, while the rumors are that it has doubled the wealth of Willeyby, the value of which is predicted for 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willey announced on Instagram that Truly was leaving, Jones left Britain with a plane to go to one of his vacation properties.
One of the sources shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
She was expected to be her long-term commitment to ensure her future over the next few decades.
She decided to leave all of them completely unprepared.
No one believed that this could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in the centre of Marlow that is full of expectations to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading “This Morning”, which is one of the UK’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to its large investment in products ranging from headsets and candlesticks to clothing and household products, as well as can lead to a delay in the marketplace.
And not in the end, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willeyby, a mother of three children, along with her husband Dan Bolduin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tarra Cap, for 10 years.
Willey himself founded Truly in 2016 with Cape, as Jones, a 52-year-old, joined as the company's chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, while Jones owns 40% of Bolduin's television producer company.
Willebe will become a "M&S brand ambassador" and will also replace Ann McParlin as the leader of the "I am a celebrity" broadcast on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: “We will not comment on his business.”
Difficulty negotiations that lead to ‘heating relationships’
He is talking about the criticisms he would bear from the press channels for commenting, which someone would consider to be “inadequate for the president” and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump resigned so much?
Trump responded in his ridiculous "innovative" way.
“I haven’t rejected anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared a "great step towards the removal of North Korea's nuclear weapon."
But the negotiations to remove this weapon are in a stop.
More than three months after the U.S. meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat R. Yung Ho reported to UN General Assembly representatives that North Korea “does not see mutual attitude” by the United States towards its country's first steps on the road to disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with the sanctions that aim to maintain tension.
Trump introduced in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relations with North Korea are wonderful,” he said.
“We were going to war with this country.
They would have killed millions of people.
Instead, we are now looking forward to great relationships.”
The president said his efforts to improve Kim’s relations have resulted in positive results – the end of missile tests, the release of prisoners and the return of the bodies of US military personnel.
He also defended his neo-orthodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to behave as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there who are trying to get into this overwhelming zone, we’d have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastates the island and leads to the death of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign non-governmental organizations, it was stated that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been forced to leave their homes, there was no national disaster, which was a requirement for international aid initiation.
"Unfortunately, in many cases there is an unintentional opinion that international assistance is not required, which makes things slightly challenging," Sumbung said.
While “Save Children” constitutes a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate on the territory of the country.
Mr Sutopo, a national spokesman for the disaster agency, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies can contribute to recovery efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains still unprepared for this kind of natural disaster.
Although asylums were built in Achech in case of tsunami, they are not commonly viewed on the other coasts.
The obvious lack of tsunami warning syrup in Palu has probably contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even in the best conditions, transportation between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
A hospital ship recently stationed in Lombok for the service of the victims of the earthquake has moved to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has turned the improvement of Indonesia’s remaining infrastructure into the center of his predecessor campaign, investing a large amount of funds in road and rail lines.
But the insufficient finances are constantly braking his office while Joko is resuming the urnes next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure, derived from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes while Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets with males, arrows, and other original weapons.
See: Daniel Steering brings late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Steering saved Liverpool from a loss in the High League against Chelsea in the 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Steering received a submission from Jordan Shakirai at about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team left with 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then pushed a precise shot to the remote angle of the door.
The ball passes over the penalty field and heads towards the upper right corner of the network.
She transferred the plumbing Cup Arisabalaga and blew herself inexpensively into the network.
“I have tried to take a good position to overcome the ball because players like Shack are always looking for posts in front positions, so I just try to win as much time as possible for a good shot to the door,” Steering told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw the questioning Cante, I threw my ball and just shot without a lot of thinking.”
Chelsea scored 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of his Belgian star Eden Azar.
The "blue" attacker sent on the fifth to Mateo Kovacić, then sprinkled from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
Kovačić quickly exchanged double submission in the center.
Then he released a quick shotgun, with which he led Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar ran away from the defenders and walked with his left foot in the distant corner next to the gateway of Liverpool Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be a video in the UEFA European League at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths after the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased by 832, according to reports from the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people have been captured among the ruins of the buildings, crashed after the earthquake with a 7.5-magnitude, which hit the country on Friday and led to waves up to 20 feet tall, the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho reported at the press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of over 380,000 people is surrounded by ruins of swings built.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was forced to die
A murder investigation began after Mursiside was discovered in Burkenhead this morning.
The remains of a 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with Grayson Miz's wounds on John Street, suspected of a murderer being arrested by a 32-year-old man.
The police have asked for help from all the regions who have seen or heard nothing.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I pray for all those who were close to John Street in Burkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the taxi drivers who may have taken something with their table cameras, to contact us as they can have vital information for the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was open was a resident of Burkenhead and found in private property.
This afternoon a group of friends, who consider the woman to be her familiar, arrived and asked where she was found in the morning.
The investigation continues, reporting that the police are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives at Graceon Moose has tried to get home to his apartment, but he has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man remained uncomfortable when he found out about what had happened.
The residents have been reported that it will take hours until they are allowed to return home.
One of the police officers reported to a man that the whole area was treated as a crime place.
There was a crying woman on the ground.
She continues to repeat “that’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 a.m. two police baths went through the border while another van stayed outside.
There are police stations in the border that are watching the housing block.
All information available is requested to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell’s parliamentary statue becomes the latest memory hit by “rewriting history”
Its prohibition will be a poetic justice for its nearly Taliban destruction of so many of the English cultural and religious artefacts, committed by its fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell’s Community described Mr. Crik’s proposal as “a fool” and “a rewriting of history”.
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's community, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that of Oliver Cromwell to Westminster Palace to become a target.
The economic majority of the British civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be a victim because of his predecessor Thomas’ actions in the previous century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is a proof of the view in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many still consider to be worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromuel is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is quite a precise presentation is subject to a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognized person that represents one side of the emergent separation.
His achievements as a Lord Protector also deserve recognition and celebration."
Chicken Killer Wounds a Fatal Chinese Farmer
Farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on a market in Southwestern China, local media report.
The man, identified only by his family as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and was covered in blood near the Liupanshui market cockroach in the province of Guajzhou, reported Sunday South China Morning Post.
The swine was prepared to inject its pork vaccine on May 30, 2005 in Xinhin, China.
He and his cousin from the neighbouring Yunan province arrived on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he also welded the door to the neighbouring car open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig in the car.
The judicial medical expertise has confirmed that 550 pounds of pigs have attacked a deadly farmer, the report reports.
“My cousin’s wound was bleeding and deformed,” said VU, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera record shows how Juan goes to the market at 4:40 p.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal killer was not owned by Yuan or his nephew.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was closed so that he could not attack someone else while police collected evidence from the crime site.
It is also reported that Yuan’s family and the market leadership negotiate a compensation for the death penalty.
Although they are rare, and before have been reported about pigs that attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Masachuzettes, and after the attack, the man had been injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pulled a Welsh farmer to his tractor while his wife managed to chase him.
After an oregone farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the blood taste may act as a "slap".
"They're just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
But a man must be treated with respect as well," the man concludes.
Weight Loss Hurricane Rose Will Lead to Frequent Rain in the Southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, the hurricane Rosa is weakening while moving over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, in the next few days, Rose will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southern parts of the United States.
Rose includes winds of 85 miles per hour, which is a category 1 hurricane from 5:00 p.m. east of the morning and is located 385 miles southwest of Eugene, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
During this time, over the Pacific begins to form a syncline that moves eastwards to the western coast of the United States. While Rose approaches the Bahrain Peninsula California on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to excite the tropical moisture deeply northwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the adjacent syncline will create frequent heavy rainfall in the southwest.
At local level 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid floods, bringing breakdowns of flows and likely lights in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to precipitation from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest it is expected to rain from 2 to 4 inches, especially above the majority of Arizona.
It is possible that there are bright floods in rapidly worsening conditions due to the distorted nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unfair to travel a shepherd in the desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn the canyons into storms, and the storm storms will lead to a raging dust and perishable winds.
The nearby syncline will lead to heavy rain in some parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitations of more than half inch, which will lead to bearable small waste flows and rough roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the rain season.
In late Sunday and early Monday, spread clouds carrying tropical rain, will begin to approach Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring major temperature fluctuations in the United States while the Arctic Ocean is cooled, but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
There is a great example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States on Sunday.
There is about 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between Saint Louis and De Moin, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer burn will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., it is expected to be a warm start in October, from the southern levels to parts of the northeast it is expected to dominate temperatures of about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanau’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the fascinating view of the testimony of the nominated for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the 1980s.
During that time, the political opposition continued, interrupting the network's regular turnover programs in the last few minutes of Friday: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleck and that the FBI must conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's Court Commission that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau was drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school coupon.
Kavanau, in his emotion-free testimony, is absolutely categorized that something like this has not happened.
It is probably even more than a number of 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen watched the witness on Friday.
The company has counted the average audiences of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that have broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also traditionally experiences difficulties in measuring the number of people who look at their jobs.
For comparison, we are talking about a audience similar to that of the championship match or the Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first among all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-to-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, it had 3.1 million, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.52 million.
The interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleck was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After a moderate Republican came out of the office with a declaration that he would vote in support of Kavanau, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday protesters as they were trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Court of Justice.
During the entire brake for a few minutes, he did not lift eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live by CNN.
“I’m right here, I’m standing in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he presents the truth to the state?
“You have power while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Fleck replied that they had already gone out of his office with a declaration and before the lift's doors were closed, he reported that it would be further pronounced during the hearing by the commission.
The cable and broadcasting networks provided dense live coverage a few hours later when the Court of Justice had to decide whether to transfer the nomination of Kavanau to the attention of the full Senate to vote.
Ala Fleck said he would do this only if he is sure that the FBI will review the charges against the nominated next week for which the Democrats insist in the opposition.
Fleck was partly convinced of conversations with his friend, the Senator of the Democratic Party Chris Kunds.
After a conversation with Queens and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His election was definitely essential, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanau.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political games” with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union in "political plays" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published with her on the first page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson strengthened her attack on her so-called "lady game plan" for Brexit, saying that Britain's collection of customs fees for the EU and vice versa is "completely absurd".
Wade Simpson's shooting: Police arrested suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of a LSU player
Police are arrested for the deadly shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Diane Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, police administration at Baton Rouge said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simpson and Simpson, reporting that the police said that Simpson had lost his glasses during the battle.
Police found glasses on the site and also found on them Simpson's DNA, reports from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's investigation, the police announced that he had admitted a fatal shot against Wade.
Its warranty is determined at $350,000, notified by Advocate.
The Eastern Judicial Medicine Office of Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, in which a fire wound was indicated as a cause of death, affected the head and neck.
The administration expressed its gratitude to the refugee search department of the Louisiana State Police, the police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and local residents for the assistance provided in the investigation that has contributed to the arrest.
LSU’s Director of Athletics Joe Aleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “temporary justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot high and 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
In the last season, he scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rickets per game.
On Friday morning, LSU’s basketball coach Will Wade reported that the team was a “snake” and a “shock” after Wade’s death.
He said, “That’s something that a person is worried all the time.”
Volcano scatters pepper over Mexico City
The volcano Popocatetel pebble was released to the southern neighbourhoods of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens to stand away from the volcano on Saturday after the crater’s activity has risen and 183 gas and pepper emissions have been recorded in the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a lot of tremors and tremors.
Photos published on social networks show a thin layer of powder that covers the front glasses of cars in some of Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Hokimilko.
Geophysicians have noticed an increase in volcano activity, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the earthquake with a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists before the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protesters confronted the gendarmerie when thousands joined the opposition demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarization vote for the resignation of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmeries, began to measure the peacekeepers with eggs and dust paint, thus creating dark and dust clouds on the streets that typically smoke by tourists.
Later in the day, other attacks with the police occurred, while the police fled to their arms to overcome the situation.
For hours, independence-supporting groups shouted, “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” until the country’s entirety was declared to be retained by “Spain forever”.
The local press reported that 14 people received medical assistance for minor injuries as a result of the protests.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the referendum was held on October 1 was considered illegal by Madrid, but was deprived of the separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although the activity was low, as the majority of opponents of the resignation boikoted a referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting in the region's voting sections with a number of boring conflicts.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it was forced to pass on a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has the hope of Catalonia’s chances of gaining independence.
Last year it was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they were able to vote, but now we seem to be standing,” the man added.
Despite the significant victory, either with a small difference, in the last December regional elections, the supporting independence of Catalonia political parties experience difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in a self-taxed castle, or have been arrested in wait of a process lastly due to their role of reorganization in independence.
Hoan Piog, 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, claims that the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
His comment is that it has made it more and more stressful.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Catalan leader in expectation of a preliminary trial last year, announced that he would apply for the European Parliament elections next year.
“My candidate for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and repressions that we observe by the Spanish government.”
Londoners: Men arrested after car crashes at home
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car had been several times in a house in London.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Bob Blamings announced that he had damaged both the port and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car is shot with a ballet.
Mega's goal takes Livingston's victory with 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
The newborn in the Livingston High League surprised Rangers and only applied to Stephen Gerard's second loss in his first 18 matches as the club manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team matched points with the second in the Hibernian classification.
Gerard's team remains unwilling to win a foreign field in the High League this season, and next Sunday he faces the leader Harts, from whom he left eight points in ranking.
But before that, Rangers is hosted by Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six matches without loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since the last month's shift to Kenny Miller's post.
Livingston missed good opportunities against unfamiliar guests
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored a goal, and his direct style of game was extremely difficult Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his strike passed through, after Alan Litgou shot along the cliff after Craig Halkett returned the ball with his head to him.
The homes left Rangers to play the ball, knowing that they could seriously harm the guests from static situations.
That's how we got to win the goal.
Rangers committed an infringement, and Livingston played well, as Declane Gallagher and Robinson combined and took out Menga, who led the ball and remarked from the middle of the criminal field.
Until that time, Rangers ruled the ball more, but faced the inextricable protection of the hosts, and the doorman Liam Kelly rarely had to interfere.
This game style continued during the second half-time, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' returner rescued Scott Pittman's foot joke, and Litlow's head hit the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston’s criminal field, the centers, however, were easily cleansed, and the judge did not respect the dump claims of the guests – first after a single-run between Halket and the Glen Middleton Reserve, and then after a hand-writing suspect.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on “Tony Macaroni Arena”
Fenomenal game and great score for Livingston.
The team just plays greatly, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its performance.
The style of the game and the composition almost did not change after returning the team to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes in the field.
Captain Halkett was incredible, organizing the defense in a great way, while Menga continued to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Warrel under tension.
At the same time, Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrate some great things, but in the case they were very under these standards.
They missed the last dog before the naked, and only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must awaken Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives mixed acceptance in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) we became witnesses to smiling and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to repair relations between NATO allies.
Friendly relationship cools because of problems affecting human rights, freedom of the media and acceptance of Turkey in the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Colon to discover a huge new jami.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented a 25- thousand crowd from gathering in front of the jury, but despite this, many supporters who wanted to see their president have collapsed.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of whom Kurdish, also raised a voice, condemning both Erdogan’s own politics and the German government’s decision to allow it in the country.
Different protests reflect a break caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some Germans and is at the same time ignored as a depot by others.
Road Accident in Deptford: Rider falls after a collision with a car
The driver died after a collision with a car in London.
The catastrophe occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a loaded road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver stopped and arrived in medical care, but the wheelchair died on the spot.
The disaster occurred several months after another cyclist died after being beaten by a fleeing driver at Childers Street, located nearly a mile from the site of the Saturday disaster.
The capital police have announced that her employees are working on identifying the man, then they will inform his relatives.
The road is closed and the bus lines are denied, and motorists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Supervisors Injured
Six prison guards were injured in a revolt in a high-level male prison, the prison office reported.
The swamp exploded in the Long Lartin prison in Warchester at about 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to overcome it, special staff from the Tordano team have been called, who will have to deal with eight free-of-liberty, with the wing itself limited to one wing of prison.
The injured supervisors suffered mild injuries on the face and received medical assistance on site.
A spokesman of the prison office said: “Specially trained employees are invited to deal with the incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six supervisors have received medical assistance.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we extremely clearly declare that the responsible persons will be handed over to the police, enabling their sentences to be extended.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the director of the prison was forced to be treated in a hospital.
In October last year, police from the fight against the rebels were invited to prison where they could overcome a severe fighting, where the staff was attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens with lightweight floods of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although dry areas may benefit)
Arizona is rarely hit by a tropical storm, but it is very likely that this will happen early next week, while the weighing hurricane Rosa is carrying through the desert of the southwest, leading to a risk of lightning floods.
The National Weather Service has already established posts against lightweight floods on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to take a different route over Phoenicia on Tuesday, which may bring rain on late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was hurricane within 40 miles from the border of Arizona.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Pool, will likely get 1 to 2 inches rain, and in separate locations, it is possible to overcome up to 4 inches.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the Rosa rain can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by the earthquake.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain will probably be useful, as the southwest part is currently in dry land.
According to the U.S. Dry Period Monitoring Commission, a little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least excessive dryness, which is the second in the heavy category,” the weather.com reports.
First, the road to the hurricane Rosa leads to the land at the Bahá California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which can still be praised on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Pont Eugene, Mexico, moving north of 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder waters over the Pacific and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the dry land in Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of upgrades.
"It is expected to rain up to 6 inches from Bahrain to the northwestern Sunora, which is possible up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Rose will then go north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona on Tuesday early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona in South Utah until Tuesday late evening.
“The main risk of Rose or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Bahrain California, the northwestern Sunora and the U.S. desert west,” the National Hurricane Center warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flashy floods and carrying different waste flows in the desert as well as flooding in mountain areas.
Midsmar Northen attack: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested for suspected murder attempts after a 16-year-old child has been discovered with wounds in Samerset.
The wound boy was discovered in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsmar North about 04:00 British time on Saturday morning.
It is located in a hospital where its condition remains "stable".
During the night, a 17-year-old boy in the Radstock area was arrested, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man, police reported in Aven and Summerset.
Police are asking everyone who may have recorded what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanau “has suffered from the submission and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every voice on judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the depraved and irritating tactics of the democratic party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wiling, Western Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau was “injured by the submission and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanau witnessed Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christian Blaise Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago in the time when both were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed during the hearing of the charge.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people today have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities of Kavanau.”
“Every voice in support of judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a real lawyer with a great reputation in the public service,” the president said in a statement.
The president indirectly voted for the nomination of Kavanau while talking about the importance of the Republican votes for general elections.
“It’s five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I am not a candidate, I actually participate too," Trump continued.
“This is why I’m running around and fighting for good candidates.”
Trump noted that Democrats have set themselves for a mission to “hinder and prevent”.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for the nomination of Kavanau is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to CNN, one of the senior representatives of the Republican party.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims grew
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken away from the small coastal giant waves when severe earthquake and tsunami defeated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when on evenings the coast was noticed by waves up to six meters high (18 feet) and brought many to their death and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami climbs after an earthquake with a 7.5-magnitude.
“When the threat of tsunami rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so many became victims of the disaster,” the spokesman of the Indonesian BNP said during a briefing in the Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
“The water had pulled with her cars, trees, whole houses, defeated everything on her way,” Nugroho continued, and added that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before striking the coast.
“Some people have stumbled on the trees and so they managed to escape the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated at the 24 center of Palu.
Posted by the disaster agency, air pictures showed multiplely destroyed buildings and stores, bridges crushed and drilled, as well as surrounded by water jamijah.
The secondary thumbs continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday day.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released from the fifth mass earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho describes the damage as “gigantic” and specifies that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were broken down.
Some of the victims’ bodies were found under the ruins of the screws were built, the spokesman added that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said the victims and damages could be higher on the coast of 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the episcopal area.
He also added that “communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggal.”
The Red Cross, on its own, indicated that there are more than 300,000 people living, adding that its teams and volunteers have already moved to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult.”
On Saturday, the agency was angryly criticized that she did not inform the defeated Palu tsunami, although officials explained that the waves had arrived during the announcement.
Shared on social networks, amateur clips show a man on the upper floor of a building shouting people on the street panic warnings about the nearby tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall blows into the shore and refers to both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to confirm the authenticity of the clip in time.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a severe interruption of electricity, which stopped communications around Palu and so difficulted the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but the evacuated still desperately needed food and other products of the first need.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue operations and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palley on Sunday.
The deaths in the Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the employees of the World Vision from Donggal managed to reach Palu safely, where they found asylum in brazen subsiles crossed in their office courtyard, they passed alongside a number of desolation scenes, says Doseba.
“They told me they saw countless destroyed houses.”
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initiated work on rescue and recovery emergency groups, some complain that the rich experience in such situations prevents foreign rescuemen from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, sending staff and supplies from abroad may only begin if the defeated place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“The poverty is still at regional level,” said Aulia Ariani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“After the government has announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a statute.”
While the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami fall, the friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for miracles and that their relatives in some way survived after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the canalization.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been crushed under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Paraplanerism Team, has trained two missing paraplaners for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the trapped in the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, added Mr. Mandagi.
“As an elder in the field of paraplanerism, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Hendon reminds him that in the hours after the news of the roa-roa breakdown of the hotel reached the paraplaner community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue labels, however, the only answer to his messages was the only gray one.
“I think this means that the messages have not been sent,” he added.
Thieves back $26,750 while charging a bankomate in Newport of Levi
Friday morning, thieves paid $26,750 from Brink’s employee, who charged a Newport Levi’s bankomate, became clear from a press release from the Newport police administration.
The driver of the car has emptyed the bankoma in the entertainment complex and is ready to charge it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While the man was busy, another man “kept closer to the back of Brink’s employee” and stole the money bag.
The witnesses noticed many suspects to escape from the scene, the report continued, but the police did not indicate the numbers involved in the stealing.
All who have information on the identity of the suspects must contact Newport police at phone 859-292-3680.
Kane West: Raper Changes His Name
Raper Kane West has changed his name.
Together with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man, officially known as Kane West.”
West, aged 41, has been used for some time as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change precedes his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He changed the singer Ariana Grande into a show that rejected “for emotional reasons,” the creator told us.
In addition to a shortening of his current professional name, West had previously claimed that the word had a religious significance for him.
“I believe that he is the most common word in the Bible, where it means “you” or “you,” shared West earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with the radio manager Big Boy.
“In this way I am you, I am you, it’s us.
Transition from Kanie, which means only one person, just to Him – which is a reflection of good in us, evil, confusion, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of the many famous in his sphere that has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of directors and names, including Puff Daddy, Puff Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferences to the pseudonyms of the Lion and Brother Leo.
One of West's former colleagues, J. Z., also appeared in a version with or without wire and/or main letters in his headquarters.
Mexico’s President swears not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swears that he will never use military force, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, President Lopez Obrador promised “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
The soldiers shooted against a peaceful demonstration on the square on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract youth to criminal bands.
The U.S. has to double the funding for the development of the IA
As China becomes more and more active on the artificial intelligence development front, the United States has to double its research budget in this area, said the researcher and developer of I.E. Kay Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was released after various units of the U.S. government made statements on the issue of the IA, although the U.S. has no official IA strategy as a whole.
During that time, China introduced its plan last year: the country is striving to become the number one of innovations in the IA by 2030.
"The duplication of the IA budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are far from the United States and are going to make further tests on IA," Lee said.
The duplication of funding can also double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of ISIS coming from the United States, as Lee informed CNBC in an interview last week.
Ley, whose book “The Superpowers of the ISIS: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Chief Executive Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s largest ISIS companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Melan Lee worked on the I. system, which won the most successful dining player in America, after which he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Ley was due to the previous technological competitions of the federal government, such as the Robotics Race of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it would be the next one, which would be helpful to recognize new missionaries.
“The researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn funding from the government,” Lee said.
“Not China takes academic leaders, but corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university lights to work on the IA.
Lee also claims that changes in immigration policy can help the United States strengthen its IA programme.
“I think doctors in science should automatically offer green cards,” the man said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from next generation in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Scientific Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners in industry and academic environments, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA reported a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million annually in the development of the IA.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature who wanted to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
The Macedonians voted in a referendum this week whether the country's name would change to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim against its territorial integrity, which requires a veto of its integration into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum himself until his boycott campaign at the same time throws a shadow of doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognize its validity.
The question of the newsletter is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that its price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the forming country after the fall of Yugoslavia Macedonia in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to vote for the country’s future, for the young Macedonians, to be able to live freely under the EU’s shadow, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Scopy.
Although the referendum does not have a binding force, sufficient parliamentary Members have said they will comply with the result of it to a degree that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the country, two-thirds of parliamentary representatives must vote.
The State Election Commission reported that no reports of irregularities had been reported by 1 a.m.
However, the election activity was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters visited the urnes.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said the 62-year-old citizen of the capital Scopy.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško voted on a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Stream on September 30, 2018.
At the age of 54, Vladimir Kavadarkov prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents, held by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly lifted heads, not through the door for servants," Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the European Asian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would lead to investments needed for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
The state also said that the positive result would lead to “the confirmation of the future of our people”.
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results of a study that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in a referendum – which is under the required activity.
Another study, a Macedonian Television Telma case, reported that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote with "yes".
In order to be successful the referendum, election activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious attack against the pro-western government’s policy since it won power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguaero from Manchester City passes through the entire defence of Brighton and marks a naked
Sergio Aguaro and Rahim Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's victory with 2-0 on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguaro's play for his naked in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine goalmaster was found with a patch in the middle of the field.
He ran three defenders from Brighton before spraying the ball into the empty space forward.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four players in green.
He walked alongside one of the defenders, then left the rest behind at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he left to Sterling.
The English attacker with a single touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who, with a hit with his right leg, overcame the gates of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguaro is fighting some confusions in his legs,” City’s director Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We planned him to play for about 55-60 minutes.
And see what happened.
“We were lucky to have noticed naked right now.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the initial advance of the "heavens" in this match from the High League of England.
He was recorded in the 29th minute.
In the naked situation, Aguaro received a deep submission in the half of Brighton.
He immediately released an exit of the left flag to Liroy Sane.
Sunne advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a paste on the remote rod.
The attacker of the “heavens” managed to cut closely, just before the ball came out in the outlet.
City will rise against Hofenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play destiny of Rockies
After Nationals didn't classify for the playoffs, there was no special meaning for another titled starter match.
And yet the ambitious Shercer always hopes to be a titled Sunday against Colorado Rockies if the match is relevant for Rockies that leads with one match in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West ranking.
Rockies guaranteed at least participation in the Wild Card match after victory with 5-2 against Nationals on Friday evening, but it is still uncertain that they will win their first title in the division.
“Although we ourselves are not fighting for anything, we want to finish a season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do everything they can to win the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I miss such a game?"
Nationals have not yet announced a start-up drink for Sunday, but it is assumed that they will allow Shercer to participate if the game is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a start-up drinker this year, while he was training on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 straycoat in 220 2/3 innga this season.
Trump hires supporters in West Virginia
The president said the situation with his elected to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanau, while talking about the importance of Republican votes in general elections.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be at risk.
It remains five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in current history – I also declare that although I am not a candidate, I really participate, that is why I struggle with all the powers for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“Everyone see this terrible, scary group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to return their power in any way, you yourselves are witnesses of their innocence, of evil.
They don’t care when they can injure anyone they need to move to get into power and governance, because they are interested only in power and governance, but we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, according to the President, have aimed at “hiding and preventing”.
“What we all see in the last four days,” he continued, calling the Democrats “wrong, dirty, unfaithful and unfaithful.”
The president reminded the Senate Judicial Commission, mentioning Senator of Democrats, Diane Finstein, namely, causing strong convictions by the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Please, what?
“No, no, I was waiting – it was really a bitch-- perhaps the worst thing I’ve ever seen.”
The labourists are no longer widespread.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the few were surprised.
In the end, I am just the last member of the Labourist parliament to whom it was stated that he wasn’t welcome – just because I’m speaking honestly.
My college in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude as he was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
With regard to the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, subjects that are ironicly similar to those with whom Jeremy has made disagreement during the time of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East labourist meeting said on Friday that “we want the meetings to include all and be beneficial.”
During most of my eight years as a local representative of the labourists in Parliament, the Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, the tone of most meetings and promises for "easier and translated" policy has long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became increasingly evident that the different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is assessed on the basis of how much it likes the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the colleagues I had previously thought to share similar political views began to expect from me to make a reversal and take positions that I would never agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
When I make public statements – no matter what I’m actually saying – I follow a total disgusting tide on social networks where it calls for revocation, rejecting moderate policy, claims that it does not belong to the labourists.
This isn't just happening to me.
In the interests of the truth, I know that I have even gained more luck than some of my colleagues, as the comments about me are at least mainly political.
I can only admire the professionalism and targetedness of those colleagues who face sexist or racist submissions every day without fearing them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the labourers should distort a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widespread, and with any sign of inconfidence or change in the rules of choice it becomes increasingly narrow.
In the last two years, I have received a lot of advice to be ashamed, not to say so much and that then "everything will be okay."
That’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labourists 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the Government of Tacher, which through my ignorance led to a literal breakdown of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – either as a local counselor or as a minister.
I have never swallowed my political views, including during the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state strikes against Brexit, it will harm households, companies and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy loyal to the labourist leader.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labourists, or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of revocation or political resignation will reject me to act in the way I think is the best to defend your interests.

Eer 38-17 Melrose: The Winners of Eer led to the ranking
The two late earnings may also change the final result, but there is no doubt that Er deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent's High League.
The team is already heading the ranking and the only one out of ten teams is without loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities have proved to be decisive in the game, which coach Peter Murchi and his team can be very satisfied.
“I’m happy that the other teams have tested us very seriously in the past matches, and we’re still without loss,” he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, “Congratulations to Er, they really benefited from their positions better than us.”
Grant Anderson's episode in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Fraser Clima, led Eer forward to the result, but the yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, freed to play in the match of Warreners, allowed Melrose to win the result after the result, after the reality of Jason Bass.
Climate increased the front for Er from a criminal hit just before the half-time, noting the case after the salt action, and then realizing the additional hit, making the 17-5 result for Er on vacation.
But Melrose started the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's assault, followed by a successful additional Bagot hit, reduced the front by only five points.
Following the ongoing stop of the game due to the severe contusion of Ruaryd Not, which was taken to the wrist, and after the re-enlargement of the Eer match, they increased their advances after Stafford McDowell and a successful additional climate strike.
Afterwards, Ear Blair McFerson's current captain received a yellow cardboard and Melrose again benefited from its number of advantages by showing strong pressure and realizing this through Bruce Colvin, followed by a failed additional hit.
However, the hosts returned the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card after breaking Clima without a ball, from the subsequent criminal play Macpherson realized the case with the help of the advanced Ear offensive line.
Climate realizes the additional strike, and not long later did it again, after Kyle Row captured David Armstrong's kidnapping ball and led the wing Gregor Henry on the flag for the fifth east of the hosts.
Still Game star seems to be heading towards a new career in restaurant business
Still Game Ford Kirnan's star seems to have aimed at a more direct and warm industry after it was discovered to be appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, on which he is also a screenwriter and one of the two stars along with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The two announced that the next nine season will be the last for the show, and it appears that Kirnan has already planned his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the "progressive restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"Sea is ours": the non-sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will open again the way to the Pacific
Navals constantly patrol the oceans with a seabed in La Paz.
There is a blue ocean flag over the public buildings.
The sea bases from the Titicaka Lake to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “Our sea belongs to us by law.
It’s our duty to bring it back.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit delivered to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call for floating from the Pacific Ocean again.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court on October 1, after five years have passed in consideration.
“The power is in Bolivia, where wisdom and unity are felt everywhere, and the country expects a positive result,” Bolivia diplomat Roberto Kalzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will see the prosecution of the international court on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Hague court will support the desire of Bolivia and that after decades of negotiations Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Here is Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is going to go to the contested re-election battle next year, has also put a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
“We are very close to returning access to the Pacific Ocean,” Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the likelihood of making a decision for Bolivia is quite small, even if it condemns it, it wouldn't change things in reality.
The United Nations Authority in the Netherlands has no authority to take the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court is only six months after hearing the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” returns the Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been broken down by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
Then she pointed out that Morales’ military rhetoric was devastated and that the little remained good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at a time continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult after a normal dialogue occurred.
Both countries have not maintained diplomatic missions in each other since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodriguez Weltse, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision is made unusually fast.
According to him on Monday, Bolivia will have “the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile”, as well as a chance to “stop 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefit to both sides”.
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political patriarch”.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to get out of the Pacific,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister R. Jong Ho said his country would never reach nuclear disarmament first unless he was able to trust Washington.
Ri introduced his speech on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of opposition countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be on the edge of restarting the non-original nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri called the idea that continuing with US sanctions and opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War would cause North to fall on the knees.
Washington tends not to agree with the declaration without Phenyan first making a significant gesture on the road to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
There is a widespread skepticism that in Pyongyang they are serious about their rejection of the arsenal that they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the latest tape of massive hats that will soon be in fashion stores to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block solar rays, you don’t need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown uncovered a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, which laughed the fashion podium during the Fashion Week in Paris.
A lot of unpracticed hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, as designers sent their cream in the eye to laugh at the fashion community.
Valentino's evolving proposal was an extravagant beige hat with a similar pearl wide periphery, which literally absorbed the heads of the models.
Other too vast accessories included decorated with jewelry dishes, witch hat and even an ananas – but they do not want to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – at the same time for Halloween.
Many of the color masks had shaved lips and reminded not as much of the highest fashion as the Hannibal Lekter.
One of the designs resembled a full set of snorkeling and glasses, while the other looked like a stunning ice cream.
If you fall on such fashion trends, you’re lucky.
Fashion specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion stores near you.
The gigantic hats come shortly after the La Bomba – the frozen hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of all – from Riana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The cult to the extremely unpracticed hat, which took over social networks, led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashionable podium – a salad beach bag, large almost as wearing it with a bath model.
The raffia cranes with a colored orange, raffia cranes with a white leather handle, were attracting all the views of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection during the Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylist of the famous Luke Armide told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made so much impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for drug accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, which continues in 2018 with another excellent performance of test results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compile and implement a personal curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that we understand about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s trials, we see that languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved high A rating.
The data collected from 74 SCIS school members showed that 72% of the students achieved A rating in Chinese, with the same estimate 72% of the German students, 69% of the French schools and 63% of those with Spanish.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and youth will certainly need for the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond them.
In 2014, a UK Employment and Labour Competition survey found that 17% of the employers were insufficient to find employees for reasons of difficulty.
Therefore, more and more foreign languages become compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more workplaces require the governance of a foreign language, which makes these skills essential to a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person conquers a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after he has a similar skill that remains for all life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the dominant several languages a person in front of competition.
According to a YouGov study, among more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not own a foreign language well enough to speak a language, as the French was the only language whose ownership reached a double-digit percentage of 15%.
This is why investment in language learning today is important for children now.
Governing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from teaching languages.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the United Kingdom in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose in independent schools, while teachers will be specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life regardless of what the future is hidden.
It cannot be denied at present that in a global business environment languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country that has to take this into account in the educational system.
Actually, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.

Lebron will debute for Lakers this Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for the fans who are eager to see Lebrone James's first match with the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would take part in the first match of the team's pre-season preparation against Denver Nights in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's going to play in two games.
“It will be in the field between one and 48 minutes,” joke Walton announced via Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau announced in Tweeter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for six matches from Lakers' pre-season preparation.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of pre-election meetings tonight in West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings, which include stops at well-known places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By delaying the confirmation voting to fill the free space in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans are threatened by loss of control over Congress when voting in November.
How many hours will Trump’s meeting in West Virginia take place tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 p.m., East weather this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to West Virginia, below by broadcasting live on YouTube.
Trump will likely consider the hearings of this week for the nomination to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, in which tension arose due to claims of immoral sexual acts, which retained the Senate's confirmation voting for up to a week while the FBI's investigation is running.
However, the main goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans initiate the elections in November.
Therefore, President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five meetings were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control on Congress is so important for his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we start a campaign season full of commitments,” said Reuters at the Trump campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
The meeting tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wales, could lead supporters from Okaio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
The second visit to Trump will be held on Saturday for this month in West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who left in sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisy that the president has come to give him a burden in sociological studies," said Simon Heather, a politician from the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
“Ryder Cup” 2018: The U.S. team will fight until last, keeping hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without an intrigue, the “forssom” matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what the “Raider Cup” needed.
Change of advantages in sports is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unreservedly, even more in competitions like that.
So, which team is in a better position right now?
"They took six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we've taken a little inertia," said Jordan Speet at the end of the competition today.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage at only twelve more to distribute.
However, as Speaker says, Americans have more to show and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Speaker and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each took three out of four possible points.
Spice shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the true leader of his team.
The appeals of the fans were increasingly stronger as he went forward in a round, in which with a precise strike he balanced the result in the fourth match, after he and Thomas left with two strikes after the first two holes.
His strike, which won them at the 15th hole, was faced with strong excited reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
“It’s important that you don’t think about anything else and focus on your own game,” Speaker said.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spider-Man and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncontroversial characters of Ryder Cup so far.
The strange, but fascinating couple from Europe won four out of four and it seems that everything is happening to them.
Mollywood was the only couple who did not make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also did not have "gods" either on Saturday morning or on Friday afternoon or in the morning.
These consecutive successes, as well as the way energy flows between them and enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better couple than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe while the sun rises.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the stories of European fame have been a little premature.
Buba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball matches from the morning while he was partnering with Alex Noren.
The “Gods” and the two “Tabula” of the first nine holes introduced the Spanish and Swedish in problems they failed to deal with.
However, there is no other way to solve your problems in the weekly matches.
“Fourball” and “Foursome” matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips that exchange each other, and how a strategy can change at any time.
The Europeans played better in a team and therefore accumulated a significant front before the last day, but this session of the forum matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight until the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid front before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the U.S. with 10-6 after playing the matches of fourball and foursom on Saturday.
Inspiring duet Tommy Fletwood and Franchesco Molinari started with two wins against the incomparable Tiger Woods, with their assets in the Le Golf National race increased by four points.
In an attempt to return the troop that lost on Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated in the tomorrow's "foourball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and ultimately Europe won the 3-1 win series.
The U.S. has made more resistance in the "foreign" matches, where they won two wins, but failed to reduce the difference.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points of the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first newborn in Europe to win four points in order, and he and Molinari, known as the Moliwood, after this sensationary weekend became only the second couple who won four points of his first four matches in Ryder Coupe's history.
After Woods and Patrick Ride unpleasantly surpassed the football matches, they were extremely motivated to defeat the broken Woods and U.S. newborn Brayson Decambu with even more category score 5&4.
Woods, who had barely passed through both of his matches on Saturday, only from time to time demonstrated a glimpse of his geniality, but so far there have been 19 losses from 29 matches in "foourball" and "fooursom" matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning football matches, partnered with Henryk Stanson in the “Forssom” matches in the 2&1 victory over Justin Johnson and Brooks Copca, respectively, number one and number three in the world.
However, the European team failed to enjoy an entirely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spiet and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Pauler in the "foourball" matches, and later returned to win Pauler and Rory Mcilroy with 4&3 in the "foourball" matches, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team took four points of deficiency before the singles, and according to the regulation, Furrick's team would keep the trophy even in equality.
However, after they have been overplayed in two days, their chances of returning on Sunday appear to be not very big.
North Korea says "no way" to disarma one-sided, without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister said on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are deepening the lack of trust in the United States and there is no way the country to resign from its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
At the World Organization’s annual general meeting, Ri Jong-Hou said "significant actions of good will have been taken in the past year," such as stop nuclear and missile testing, destroying the nuclear testing facility and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see any relevant reaction from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances there is no way to first disarma one-sided.”
While Ri expressed North Korea's famous complaints of Washington's resistance to a "poety" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea will be rewarded, as she took step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant, not rejecting the one-sided nuclear weapon.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump gave security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea seeks the official end of the Korean War of 1950-1953, but the United States says Phenyan must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to relieve strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States urges to “first remove nuclear weapons” and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals through force, and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
“The belief that the sanctions can cause us to fall on the knees is a meaningless dream of those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our infidelity."
Ri did not mention whether it was planned to hold a second meeting between Kim and Trump, for which the U.S. leader stressed in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moun Jing over the past five months, and added: “If the issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea, not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stop.
However, Ri’s speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the UN General Assembly that the orientation of North Korean missiles to the U.S. continent is inevitable after the “bad president” Trump called Kim a suicide missile.
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that there is still much work and sanctions to remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump emphasized that there is no time for it, and he said, "It doesn't matter whether it will take two, three or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must definitely continue until complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament is implemented."
The Security Council unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the funding of Phenyan’s nuclear program and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri at the tournaments of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Phenyan again in the next month to prepare the second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress has been made, but only after a few hours North Korea accused him of sending "ganster requests".
At a meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile object and a nuclear complex if the United States took the "assessment" measures.
According to him, Kim told him that “the appropriate measures” to which he sought are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wishes to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard courses for enough vacation
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing culture to learn “the whole night” with the help of caffeine.
The teacher found that students at university number one in the world often don’t even think about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Keysler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and women's hospital, prepared a course that he thinks he's the first in his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep loss on learning.
“A girl finally came to me and said, ‘Why do they tell me this in my last year?”
She said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of a dream that surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains students the most important thing about how good sleep habits help academic and sports achievements, as well as to improve overall well-being.
Paul Barray, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the University decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive tasks.
In one part there is an image of a room in a guest room, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, marathons and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements are influenced by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of sleeping routine.
Another part of the participants tells how long-term sleep loss can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” said Professor Caser.
The culture of pride of “learning the whole night” still exists, he said, and added that modern technologies and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep loss is a growing problem.
Providing enough and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, tiredness and anxiety,” he says – even in order to avoid filling, as sleep-leasing brings the brain into a constant hunger mode.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who taught chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Caser prepare the course, taking one of his classes in his first year in Harvard.
He says his course "opened his eyes" and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It is hoped that the next step is that all graduate students are asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kysler recommends students to consider whether to set up sleeping and awakening alarm and to know the harmful effects of the blue light, broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disturb the circus rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's naked breaks Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kidnapping broke down Steven Gerard's fake team and won 1–0 for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory as a guest from the triumph in February with 4–1 over St. Johnson, but Gary Holt's team barely defeated Gerard's second defeat in his 18th match as a manager, leaving his team with eight points less delayed in La La Ladd in the delayed Harness team.
Menga noted seven minutes before the rest, and the lack of constructive ideas of the Rangers team at no point seemed close to equation.
Following the match, Rangers took sixth place, and Livingston was already third, leaving the second Hibernians only on a headache.
There may be additional problems for Rangers, as side judge Callam Spens got a wound on his head after he was hit with an object that obviously was thrown by the guests' fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that defeated Er in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with Livingston's same single-seater, who pulled out a point against Harts last week, and should be satisfied with the way his aggressive team packed all the opponent's actions.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston managed better in rare cases when they possessed it.
They had to take note even in the second minute when Menga took out Scott Pittman with a touch against the Gateway Alan McGregor, but the semi-defender missed the good opportunity.
Later Kigan Jacobs' focus of faul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defending partner Alan Litgou dismissed the ball from the back.
Rangers managed control over the game, but failed to create nothing containing in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought that there should be a bump in the 15th minute when he met Stephen Lawles, but the reference Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian claims.
Rangers had only two precise shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox Gateman Liam Kelly was easy to deal with the head of Lassana Kuliballi and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Liby’s fall in the 34th minute was surprising in view of the possession of the ball, it was totally deserved.
Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep concentration.
Scott Arphield does not react when Declane Galhaher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who coldly supplied Menga for which it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the rest, changing Kuliballi with Ryan Kent and this change almost immediately led to the result when the wing gave Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the hit.
However, Livingston continued to force the guests to play in a comfortable for the host style of the game, such as Litgou and Halkett constantly reflecting the forward-looking long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its front in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' strike, and at the subsequent corner Litgou shooted with a head along the cliff.
Entered as a reserve of Glen Middleton from Rangers, he asked for a buzz at the end of the two battles after Jacobs' unity, but Tomson never saw anything wrong in the situation again.
Anniversary: The inventor of the heightener
Page of our annual Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and BROEN... the day that was born the future physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Gayger in Germany.
Geiger develops a method of sealing and measuring radioactivity, which ultimately leads to the creation of a device known as a Geiger Counter.
A stone in science since then, the heightener has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, when in 1950 the Coronado Campangues, in which apparently participated the incredible scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released.
Man: “What is this, for God’s sake?
Rogers: This is a hexagonal counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms separated from radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: “It really matters right now!”
Hans Hayger died in 1945, only a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to "see" foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory.
Then they can "see" a protein, which is common for many types of cancer and is re-injected in the patient.
The sample vaccine showed promising results in patients with different cancer diseases.
A woman treated with the vaccine that trains the immune system to identify foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common for many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injected in the patient.
According to Professor J. Berzofsky from the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Betesda, Maryland, “The results suggest that we have a lot of promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of breast cancer,” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorful cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and their "training" how to target cancer cells was used in the treatment of leukemia.
Kenny West spoke in support of Trump, wearing a hat entitled "Let's make America big again" when we participated in the SNL.
It wasn't good.
Kenny West was dismissed in the studio during Saturday Night Live, after doing a meaningless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be nominated for president in 2020.
After completing his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he was wearing a hat with the title "Let's make America big again," he declared himself against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I often speak with whites and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have been leaving America for a long time,” he said.
SNL started the show with Matthew Damon, in which the Hollywood star played the witnesses of Bret Kavana in front of the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blaze Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's performance was loaded into social networks by comedy Chris Rock.
It's unclear why Rock tried to play West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the balls because of his hat.
“I was terrified behind the cults.
They said, "Don't get out of this hat."
They're telling me!
And then they claim that I am on a vessel,” he said in Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Do you want to see the floating ship?" claiming to wear Superman's costume because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love."
The comments caused at least twice the audience's crash, and SNL's team members seemed to be ashamed, said Variety, one of them told: "The whole studio was shut down."
West was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
Western is a lot of surprises with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of the CEO of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Kandes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of the most brave: Thank you to you when you are in the face of the TPUSA.”
Karen Hunter, the leader of the stream show, said on Twitter that West was just "being herself and that's great."
“But I choose not to reward a person (when I buy his music or his clothes or support his “art”) for whom I think he welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
“We are the same ones,” she added.
The rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now “is officially known as Kenny West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the example of Deddy, also known as Puff Deddy, Puffy and P.D.D.
His friend, the rapper Snup Dog, was Snup Lyan, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
Prosecution for murder after a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of a murder attempt after a man was crushed with a knife in an eastern restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the Magistrate Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecutor.
The Star of The Throne, Kit Harington, is against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as the devastating sword John Snow in the full-time medieval fantasy series of NGO "The Throne Game".
But the 31-year-old actor declared himself against the macho hero's stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads young people to often think they should be " raw" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has been confused” and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner of the "Throne Game" Rose Lesley, also at the age of 31, admits that he feels "very convinced" that this problem needs to be solved.
“I am personally very convinced—what did we confuse about masculinity?” he said.
"What do we teach adult men about the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to many male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and street that makes the boys feel that they need to become this particular type of men?
I think this is really one of the biggest issues of our time – how to change it?
Because something is obviously confused with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the prehistory or continuation of the "Throne Game" after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he "completed with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will participate in the restoration of the True West of Sam Shepherd, a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actress recently said that dating his wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened in the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so he gave me my future family and set my life in advance,” he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl in which Kit John Snow's hero falls in love, in the fantasy series, awarder of the Amy Awards.
The two married in June 2018 at Lesley’s home in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump of the population living with HIV and spins.
According to healthcare services, more than 820,000 people have been affected.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases have been reported.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which notes a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV spreads rapidly into some parts of China as a result of the transfer of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China’s healthcare services said at a conference in Yunan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and spins in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminalized in China, but discrimination against people in the CGBT communities has been widespread.
According to the study due to conservative values, 70-90% of men who had sexual relations with men were finally married to women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are as a result of incorrect protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised to provide universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to have data from Senators from the Republican Party, swearing "Dangerous Lies" and "Conspiracy Theories"
The U.S. House of Representatives Maxin Waters on Saturday condemned the charges that a member of her team has published personal information to three U.S. senators from the Republicans of the Wikipedia lawyer pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said that the claims were made by experts and sites on the "ultra right wing".
"Lies, lies, and more deceitful lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Gream from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on accusations of immoral sexual behaviour against the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavanau.
The expiration was carried out after the three senators discussed Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of publications is linked to the Waters Office, and provided information about its team member, according to Hill.
“This injustice is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Walters continued.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the expiration of this information.
This irrevocable claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly caused criticism online, including former White House Secretary Ari Flaicher.
“There’s a poison in this denial,” Flyer wrote.
“This suggests that she does not have the temperament suitable for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
You shouldn't be challenging.
I shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must be calm and balanced."
Fleicher compared Walters’ reaction to the criticism of the judge Cavano, who was accused of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the location of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s important if it’s true,” he wrote.
In his statement, Walters said that her office has seized the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the committers will be disclosed," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny England's Review Is Exploding Again - The Slow Spy Parody with Rowen Atkinson
It is now traditionally looking for references to Brexit in any new British film with participation and it appears that this also applies to the rebirth of the Execution comedy, a spy franchise for Johnny Ingliss – which started in 2003 with Johnny Ingliss and returned in 2011 with Johnny Ingliss Returning.
Will self-smiting and mymics that say how obviously we are foolish become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the uncompetitive Johnny Inglish with an eye rooted and a “cute” person has the permission to repeat things for the second time – his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation designed for fans of the movies who don’t speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims for a brilliant brilliance, possesses a little of Closo, a little of Mr. Bin and a large part of the man who contributed with a note on the musical theme Chariots of Fire at the London Opening Ceremony in 2012.
In addition, he was originally based on the abandoning chaos behind himself a traveller and an international man that Atkinson played in Barclaycard's already forgotten television ads.
In the last film with Johnny Ingliss there are or two good moments.
I liked when Johnny Ingliss approached a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and shortly the curtains wrapped in his neck.
Atkinson’s contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor is quite weak and strangely excessive, especially when “serious” film brands such as “007” and “Mission impossible” include a dosage of comedy.
Humor appears to be more directed to children than adults, and Johnny Inglish's crashes, I think, are not innovative and focused, as Actinson's no game reminds Mr. Bin.
The current assumption is that the UK is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker has hacked the British super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operational agents for the horror of the debut agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister who is inundated and inundated figure and has already suffered from a full break of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives herself everything for this quazzy-Tressa-Mei role, but in the scenario there is nothing to do with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she must call a retired agent as all the agents acting are compromised.
And that means Johnny Ingliss himself, who currently works as a teacher at a shikous center, who, however, illegally teaches lessons how to be an undercover agent: here are some good hits when Ingliss re-creates a spy rock academy.
English has been invited to Whitehall for urgent instruction and reassembled with his former long-standing assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Because he's already a family man, married to a commander of a submarine, a fun role in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent has little missed.
So, Batman and Robin are again in the game to solve the big problems of His Majesty's secret services and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the malicious Jason Volta played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their odyssey of fars: dressed as servitors, burn French restaurant; create chaos when they drive to the luxury yacht of Volta; and English triggers true anarchy when it tries to use a shade for virtual reality to recognize the interior.
All smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so friendly and boring, there is much more content for children here.
A lot of intermediate products.
As with other films about Johnny England, I continue to think: Can the British film industry give Atkinson a role that corresponds to his talent?
Labourists deny that British plans to work four days a week, but to receive a pay for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that the British should work four weeks, but receive a pay for five.
The party claims that the company’s heads want to provide the economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers, giving them another day of rest.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say that the idea would “think” the economic programme and the party’s plans to spread the country to the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “It is expected to be reported before the end of the year for a policy review.
“It will not happen immediately, but the four-day working week is a strife that fits into the rebalancing approach to the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its overall pre-election campaign in 2017.
However, at the moment, this strife does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
The labourist spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not in the party’s politics.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald's last week's labourers' conference to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the "infinite directors" and "specialists" in the municipal services firms.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not receive their entire share, as the Labour Government may require “support” on the basis of the established violations.
In addition, he confirmed the plans to put workers into the boards of companies and establish private funds to transfer 10% of the net capital to private companies that can accumulate annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Gram and John Kennedy say 60 minutes ago whether Cavano's investigation by the FBI could change their opinion
The FBI's investigation into accusations against Judge Bret Kavano delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raised the question whether the findings of the office could make some of the Senators from the Republican Party withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelly asked senators from the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsay Gram whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I want to say, of course,” said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I talked to the judge Cavano.
I called him after the case, after he came out of the statement, and I asked him, "Do you do that?"
He was decisive, categorical and unintentional.”
The voice of Graham seemed uncompromising.
“I have an opinion about Bret Kavano and to change it, it is necessary to blame the blame,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know that: Bret denied it categorically,” Gream added, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
“No one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it contribute to poverty reduction at all?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which has an impressive composition of performers and performs as an impressive mission: the elimination of poverty worldwide.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the big scale at the Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get acquainted with the real goal of the event – the elimination of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Poverty Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty project, an international group of protection that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you don't want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as a voluntary participation, send no email to a world leader, call on the phone or link in another way to help them raise the target of a savings.
But how successful is the Global Citizen for 12 years before reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to require action or is simply another case of so-called “cliquity” – people think they do something important when they sign an online petition or post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters who are calling for various purposes.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages arising from its actions, from which at least $10 billion have been paid or collected.
The group believes that the insured funds have already had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include the Power of Food established in the UK partnership between investors and performers, committed to “aid children to develop their full potential”, which promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help stop the non-nutrition in the country” by Twitter “700 citizens after receiving more than 4 citizens.
“With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of non-nutrition simply into a historical note,” said Ambassador of the Food Force, Tracy Ulman, before a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to call for Britain to improve mothers and children’s nutrition, the government has reported funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CSV on his website asking, "Why do you think we can stop exceptional poverty?"
“Global Citizen,” he replied, “it will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.
But as with the big civil rights movement and against the apartment before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bi, Janel Mona are just some of the artists of this year's New York event, to which the leaders will be Deborah Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use naval forces to "bloque" and prevent energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington may, if necessary, go to its naval forces to prevent the entry of Russian energy products to the markets, including the Middle East, reveals U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zink, according to Washington Examiner.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria, particularly where it acts on the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they did in East and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States can, through our marine forces, ensure that marine roads are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products are not enough to reach the market,” he said.
Zink focuses on the present event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is presented as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He wanted to compare Washington’s approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuel," he said, defining Russia as a "one-numbered pony" with an economy depending on the exhaustive fuel.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration has the task of strengthening liquid gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" pipeline project "North Flow 2", which according to Trump turns Berlin into a "logger".
Moscow has pointed out several times that the pipeline for $11 billion of North Stream 2, which will double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s flaming opposition to the project is simply produced for economic reasons and is an example of unreasonable competition.
"I believe that we share the point of view, that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the German Industry Federation (DBDI), urged the United States not to engage in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party is dealing with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts Senator said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would “see seriously” the presidential nomination after the interim elections.
During a city council in Holocaust, Massachusetts Warren confirmed that he was thinking of applying.
“It’s time for women to enter Washington and repair our broken government, and this includes a woman at the top,” she said.
“After November 6 I’ll take seriously a look at the nomination for president.”
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the City Council, saying that he “leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I am worried about the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was honest in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano.
In a tweet post on Friday, Warren said, “Obviously we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a sociological study conducted on Thursday showed that most voters in Warren themselves do not think it should be nominated in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Masachusetts said that the senator should not apply, according to a study from the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidate.
The sociological study showed more support for the candidate to former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent against and 48 percent against.
Other top representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed on potential candidates in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Byden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin indicated PTSR on Trak Palin on a meeting for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after recording in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son passes through after returning is known to other families who feel the consequences of the PTS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are coming home,” she said in a meeting at Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "slaughter in the room" and told his son and other veterans of the war that "they come back a little changed, corroborated, back and wonder if they will receive that respect they and their brothers have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a non-distressed state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Vasilla Police Administration.
18 states and District of Colombia support the controversy of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Colombia support the judicial dispute of a new U.S. policy that rejects the asylum of victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from the 18 states and county filed a request for good will in Washington to support asylum seekers and dispute policy, NBC News said.
The entire name of the prosecutor was not disclosed in the case "Grace vs. Sections", which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed against the federal policy in August.
She said her partner “and the sons of the cruel members of his band” had insulted her, but US officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the United States, such as nations faced comprehensive band problems and domestic violence.
The U.S. asylum policy returned the 2014 immigrant appeal council’s decision, allowing immigrant documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbus’ lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires all asylum applications to be examined according to specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle,” the report of good will says.
In addition, lawyers argue that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants harms the U.S. economy, arguing that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "to provide the necessary workforce."
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sesions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims fleeing from domestic harassment and gangster violence.
"Asylum is given to those who leave their native country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political beliefs," Sections said in a July 11 statement on politics.
Asylum was never intended to relieve all problems – not even all serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while deaths double during the search for survivors
The situation for survivors is becoming increasingly difficult.
“I feel very stressed,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, quieting her sick boyfriend in a devastating city of Palu evacuation center.
“Every minute, the clinic is carrying more bodies.
The clean water is unclear."
The residents are noted to return to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their floods.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals injured by a 7.5-magnetic earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were located outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to persistent secondary traumas.
His eyes are filled with tears when he remembers how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“I had no time to save myself.
I think I was pressed on the ruined wall,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that he came to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then she quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "tormost" with "propaganda ads"
One week after the official newspaper in China released an advertisement on four pages in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump appealed to China Daily’s paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the U.S. Congress elections on 6 November.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. Congress elections noted what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to launch ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war in which they equate import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the U.S. and China at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which support the Trump Republican Party.
The U.S. ambassador to China, Terry Brandt, and former long-standing governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had been ruining U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, a commentary from the Des Moines Register, says, “it currently doubles this brake by launching propaganda advertisements in our own free press.”
“When its propaganda is spreading, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the respected tradition of freedom of speech and press in America, launching paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“Unlike that, on a newspaper stand down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
Kavanano Poverty Republicans Defeat Voters Women for Interim Elections, Analysts Warn
Since many of the high-ranking republicans stand behind and defend the nominated for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavano, with regard to several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a response, particularly women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around the stairs are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noticed that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be returned," said Grant Raher, professor of politics at the University of Syracuse School Maxwell, in front of the Hill article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the last moment Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona)’s claim for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm up the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman for the MoveOn Progressive Group, on Friday, according to Washington’s newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters scanned “November comes!” during a demonstration at the Senate’s corridor, as the Republicans who control the judicial commission decided to continue with the nomination of Cavanato despite the witnesses of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, said Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” said Stu Rottenberg, an unpartisan political analyst.
“People say that the problem is already serious; that’s true.
But it can become even more serious, especially among predecessor women and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years old, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford's public testimony, describing her allegations of sexual assault against the nominated at the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that a response may be followed if Republicans claim to confirm the candidate.
"It has become a big confusion for the Republican Party," said Michael Still, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavano has been placed on the rocket. It’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they deal with it,” said Gay Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps in the election of Democrats.
However, the Americans seem somewhat divided by who to believe as a result of Ford and Cavanato’s testimony, a little more turning to the second.
A new sociological study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are determined or likely to believe in Ford’s evidence, and 35 percent say they are determined or likely to believe in Cavanato.
In addition, 38 percent say that Cavano probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claim the same for Ford.
Following Fleck's claim, the FBI currently investigates Ford's claims, as well as at least one more prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, reported.
Last week, Ford swears to the Senate's court committee that Cavanano attacked her in an unrestrained state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her gender before her while they were on a party during her follow-up in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of World Wide Web Tim Burnners-Lee starts a start that aims to compete on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company that builds the open-source platform of Burns-Ley Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which individuals have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Bernors-Ley, the intention behind Inrupt is a "global dominance".
“We have to do it now,” he said in terms of the start.
“This is a historical moment.”
The application uses the Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online personal data storage” or POD.
It contains lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available on each browser, and at the same time are all at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines which information has access to.
The company calls it “giving the powers of personal data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Burns-Ley, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a work contract on the project, and a group of volunteers developers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Ley said he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they make a full change or not when all of their business models are fully updated for one night.
“We don’t want permission from them.”
In a medium publication on Saturday, Burns-Ley wrote that the mission of Inrupt is to provide energy for trade and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid.
In 1994, Burns-Ley transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
Over the past few months, Burns-Ley has had a strong influence on the network neutrality debate.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Burns-Ley will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this new age on the Internet,” Burns-Ley added.
Bernard Van: in the memory of the priest, endowed with the cross Victoria during the First World War
It is celebrated for 100 years in the native city of the only English priest, awarded the cross Victoria for his participation in warfare during the First World War.
Deputy Lieutenant Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 at the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was endowed with the highest military honors of Britain.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Ruschden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the monument was “except symbolic” to be discovered for 100 years by his grandfather’s work with a medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mushroom and under a heavy shot of artillery and cards."
Later, he attacked the fire line and with "unexpected braveness" led the building forward before attacking an artillery army with one hand and killing three of the team.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions are “something I know I could never do but make me calm.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, put a vein after the parade, watered by the Brenwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "a great honor to participate in the parade" and added "the youth of the real hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead received Peppa Pig
Imagine that you’re waiting for a full edition of Bellator 206 all night and you can’t finally become witness to the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 bi-games, including six of the main maps and had to be broadcast live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., when Hegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the British viewers were amazed when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they were building up early hours, especially because of two-war.
Fan described on Twitter the switching of the children's animation film as "a kind of sick joke".
“The government regulates that this content is not appropriate at 6 p.m. so the program was changed with child transmission,” said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, in response to a question about broadcasting.
“Peppa the pig,” yes.
The company's president Bellator Scott Cocker said they would work on meeting planning to include British audiences in the future.
“I think, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem,” Cohort said.
“There, however, is six in the morning on Sunday and there’s no way to plan things so that the event will take place on Sunday and there – on Monday.
We're still working on this.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't that, it was a government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to stick to the inclusion of five two games instead of six – as usual we do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we crossed.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” due to his sexuality
The Olympic water jumper, Tom Daley, says he has grown up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexuality – but that has motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says that until he began to study in high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lawrence Lawrence, he talked about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympics.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Christy Young, has been in hospital for a few months.
When he participated in Lavern Daley's first program, he said he felt "less" than everyone else while he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
He said, “Today, the feeling of invaluability and the fact that I am different from others are actually things that give me energy and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The Dual-Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in the this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to discriminate homosexuality.
He said he did this because he was happy that he could live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope” of others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man, American director Dustin Lans Black, whom he met in 2013, he was "a surprise."
Daley married an Oscar carrier who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you go through so much as you're so young," he said, "and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone in your age who has experienced similar climbs and falls."
Both of them became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley himself says that “his entire peace view” has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was interested only in winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told his father that he could not admit that he would die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he had already tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London – as he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not with me, dad, or in the first row,’ he told me.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing, and at the moment when I realized he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn't invisible," he said.
The next year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew I had a dream of this all my life – to download the Olympics in front of the audience at home. There was no more terrible feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Proud – by Heather Smol – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympics and still made him stumble.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 pm, British summer time.
The lost form of Michaelson remains on the rock for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Michaelson will put a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to restore his old form if he doesn't want his record to be linked to failure.
Michaelson, who participated in the two-year recorded 12th event, was left on the squad by Captain Jim Furrick for the "foourball" and "fooursom" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being again the main figure in the U.S. team, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his hits from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who has never been among the most straight-line players, is not in an optimal form for the hard playground of Le Golf National, where the long-term inequalities usually punish every wrong strike.
And if the game itself is not anxious enough, in the nineth match on Sunday, Michaelson will face the precise champion of the British Open French Molinari, who is in a team with the newborn Tommy Flitwood and seeks to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans who leave four points before the 12 single matches make a strong start, it may seem that Michaelson’s match is absolutely decisive.
Furrick expressed confidence in his colleague, although he could hardly say something much different.
"He fully understood his role today, screamed my back, threw me down, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He's confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine playing only in two games.
I was expecting him to play more, but just that's how it happened, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play as well as everyone else."
Michaelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the most matches in the Ryder Cup, played on Sunday.
This can put an end to his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never approached his impressive individual achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven matches, but Furick said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by figures.
"He's funny, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to joke with people and he's a great person for every team," he said.
“I think even younger players have fun with him, especially this week.
He gives a lot more than just to play.”
Thomas Burn, captain of Europe, is aware that the big front can soon be stopped.
The captain of Europe's team, Thomas Bjorn, knows from personal experience that the big front, accumulated before the single matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily be removed.
The dancer debuted at Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points in front of the Americans, but precisely at the final right was almost tired and barely managed to retain the victory with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You’re still reminding us that we had a big front of Valderrama; we had a big front of the Brookline where we lost, and we won Valderrama, but very difficult,” Bjorn said after the 2018 European team won with 5 to 3 Golf sessions on Friday and the 10th of the National.
So the story must show both to me and to everyone in the team that it's not all over.
Be ready for the attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you need.
Nothing has ended until you see the end result on the table.
We have a goal and it is to try to win this trophy and that's exactly what we have to stay focused.
I have repeated all the time that I think only about the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our competitors who are one of the world’s biggest players.”
Satisfied with the performance of players on a hard golf course, Burn added: “I would never hurry with the celebrations.
Tomorrow it will be different.
Tomorrow, individual executions will be done in advance, and this is different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, you put your entire capability as a golfer.
This is the message you have to reach the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner's back, as he must be separated to the end."
Unlike Burn, Captain Jim Furrick will ask his players to present themselves better individually than as partners, as exceptions are only Jordan Spice and Justin Thomas who took three out of four possible points.
Furrick himself was on both sides of these great returns last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then from the losing country when Europeans performed the "Medinah Wonder".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question, how Ben Krenshau, Captain in 1999, led his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to start the same good start as you saw on Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these interim matches are played under huge tension.
So we shaped our composition and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas has been assigned to lead our counterattack and to rise against Rory McYlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Jan Paul meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I chose these players in this line because I think this gives us the greatest chances of success,” Bjorn said on his choice for the Singals.
Germany again delays the launch of a new warship
The newest fleet of the German fleet had to be introduced in 2014 to replace the old warships from the time of the Dark War, but this will not be carried out at least next year due to the incorruptible systems and majorly growing costs, local media reported.
The introduction to the operation of Rheinland-Pfalz, the brand’s leading new fragrance vessel of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited the army spokeswoman.
The naval vessel had to join the Naval forces in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the elderly Bremen class fregates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful rope, a set of anti-air and anti-naval missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – the latest fragments must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to the ports of residence.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the advanced military vessels - which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean - will be old when they enter operations.
The F125 hit the title last year, when the German fleet officially refused to launch the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipwreck in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to the ship builder after shipping.
It is little known for the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of substantial "software and hardware defects" that make the military ship unused if sent to a war mission.
Software disadvantages are particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg's naval vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 navals – only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frags.
In addition, it has been shown that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and limits the possibility of marine forces to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton “Rheinland-Pfalz” is estimated to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defect hardware, the price of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached the amazing €3.1 billion (3.6 billion) of the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are joining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Chief of the German Parliament Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet "is actually exploring ships capable of carrying out missions."
The official said the problem has become bigger in time, since the old ships are carried out by exploitation, but no new ones are provided.
He complained that no Baden-Wuerttemberg fragrance could be included in the fleet.
The National Strip Tracks the Secret Life of the Stickers
A new study conducted in a property in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how the stickers use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that the discoveries will throw new light on the behaviour of the unique flying bowlers and will help guide future protective actions.
The study by scholars from the Scottish National Truss will follow the common stickers, as well as the sharp sneakers at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the property to track the activities of the stickers during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of calling sounds of the stickers, as well as what kinds they issue.
Then a map of residence and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Duar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of residence are most important for adhesives and how they are used of any kind.
This information will help to determine the benefits of housing management work, such as the creation of floods, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for adhesive and other related species.
The population of stickers in Scotland and the UK in general declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their asylum and lead to loss of habitat.
There may be a risk for populations from wind turbines and lighting, flying equipment and some chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, the stickers are not blind.
Nevertheless, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a snake.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to saturate insects and obstacles on their flight pathway.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the stickers very seriously.
It has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, asylum inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special adhesive reserve in the Threave property in the area of Dumphrey and Galoway, which is home to eight of the ten types of adhesives in Scotland.
House manager David Thompson says it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great terrain for the stickers," he said.
“We have old buildings, many adult trees and a perfect location.
But there are still lots of things about stickers that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better than what they need to bloom."
He emphasizes that it is important to check for the presence of adhesives before carrying out real estate maintenance activities, as it is possible that a single asylum will destroy up to 400 female and young adhesives, as well as destroy the entire local population.
Adhesives are protected and are illegal to kill, brake, disrupt or destroy their asylums.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Officer in the Stream for the Protection of Lips, encourages the society to help.
She said, “I still have a lot to learn about our sticks and many of our species because we just don’t know what’s going on with their populations.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims and his lawyers will judge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo declared the claims of rape against him as a "false news," saying that people "will become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will judge the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of rape by American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was claimed to pay her $375,000 afterwards to silence the incident, Der Spiegel said Friday.
In a video on Instagram, turning to its 142 million followers, a few hours after the publication of the claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo squeezed the publication as a "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is a fake news,” the five-time golden ball carrier told the camera.
“They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to accumulate popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and it’s all right,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to judge Der Spiegel for claims that call “unacceptable publication of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the footballer would ask for compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The incident occurred in June 2009 at an apartment at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the footballer's room, where he was claimed to have raped her anal, according to the documents filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and said he was a "good boy" to "99 percent", but in the case he just submits himself to "one percent."
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "free of revenge" and was worried not to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she wishes to cancel the agreement as she continues to live with the injury of the incident.
During the incident, Ronaldo was on the edge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian border Juventus for the amount of €100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will be sorry for losing car manufacturers forever”
The United Kingdom will “will regret” if it loses its status as world leader in car production after Brexit,” said business secretary Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "disturbed" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production in their factory in Burnston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delaying the border in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to a loss of jobs.
Last year, nearly 150,000 cars were manufactured at the factory in Burnston, where Auris and Avensis models were manufactured, 90% of which were exported to other countries from the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain left the EU by the end of March, production in the factory will stop us,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says it will close its factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in cases of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota’s production line works on the “precise time” principle, as parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be problems at the border, which according to the industry can lead to delays and deficiency of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait for more than a day to complete their inventory at the Darbisher factory, the company said, and therefore the production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Teresa May's "shake" plan for future relations with the EU is "preciously calibred to avoid these border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to conclude the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to gain this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Following not only Toyota’s claims, but also other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota can’t tell how long the production will be stopped, but in the longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been a founder of the Unite Union at the factory for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly worried: “Once I have tried, I judge that if these jobs leave, they will never return.
The government spokeswoman said, “We have set a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Vice-Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week,” as the fight for the Supreme Court’s candidate, Bret Kavano, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Advisor Robert Müller, who investigates Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trump’s assistants and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the President.
Whether Trump will release the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been feeding Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that claim.
But last Monday he went to the White House after reports that he would give up.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced on Thursday.
Trump shared that he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the hearing before the Senate’s legal commission, for which they witnessed both Cavanato and one of the women who accused him of sexual disturbance – Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly investigation by the FBI of complaints against Kavano, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
When asked her a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It’s still not a date for this, maybe this week, but seeing all the other things happening at the Supreme Court, I think it can also be delayed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders had not held a press conference from the White House on September 10.
Chris Wallace, the head of the broadcast, asked about the reason.
Sanders responded that rare press conferences are not due to disobedience to the “demonstrative behaviour” of television journalists, although he shared: “I can’t say I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behaviour.”
She then insisted that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president conducts more questions and answers than any president before him,” she said without citing evidence: “We have checked these statistics.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the US President, it is much better than to talk to me.
We try to do this often, and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in the last few weeks, and this will replace press conferences after you have the opportunity to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guest seniors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president might show why, with his excentric behavior and at times strange behaviour in front of the gathering journalists.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service with respect to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the state’s appreciation and desire to stay in their places after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter in the remaining less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken the expenditure for the EU citizens' status of decentralized public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, and this autumn decisions are expected.
But the UK government is also moving forward in preparing for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you of how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, no matter how national it is.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare services, as it is beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would like to stay here.”
Christian Ambercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after he gets head injury
Tennessee's lanebacker, Christian Ambercrombie, has undergone an emergency surgery after receiving head injury during the Saturday meeting when his team lost by Vanderbilt Komodors with 31-27 years, Mike Organ from Tennessee said.
Tennessee State’s senior coach, Rod Reid, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fell there," Reid said.
Coaches and doctors submitted oxygen to Abercrombie on the sideline before it was placed on a necklace and brought to the convulsion hall for additional review.
Tennessee State's official face confirmed Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Ambercrombie had gone out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is still no details about the type/gravity of the injury,” as well as that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Ambercrombie, a college scholar, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blockages before leaving the game, making a total of 18 blockages for him during this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher hedge tax when buying real estate in the UK
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher herb tax when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the hedge tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The state hash expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds a year, which will help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce the decision of foreign buyers to pay higher herb tax when buying real estate in the UK, while additional revenues will go to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Korbin’s efforts to attract young voters, promising more accessible housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in herb tax will affect individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and with additional revenue will help the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping in the streets.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current hedge tax, including higher levels, introduced two years ago for second housing and real estate purchased for the purpose of award – can reach up to three percent.
The state hash is expected to increase revenues by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased from people with citizenship outside the UK, which leads to price rise and makes it difficult for people who buy their property for the first time to interfere in the real estate market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “psychiatric cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy emerged only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in herb tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused the major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices, but not using land, and asked Ms. May to leave quotas for available housing to repair the UK’s “show of housing”.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive set of proposals for housing reforms, including checks on rents and ends of "no-vins".
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
"I shared last year that I would like to dedicate my time as a prime minister to restore the British dream - the life of every new generation to be better.
This means to fix our broken housing market.
The UK will always be with open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not good for people who do not live in the UK as well as foreign companies to buy their homes as easily as hard workers in the UK.
Too many people the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the disturbance of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: "My goal is to lead Scotland's team"
Sunderland’s manager Jack Ross said his “largest ambition” in his career was to be the highest coach of Scotland’s national team.
The 42-year-old Scotch has accepted the challenge to regain the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, at three points of the first place.
He went to Stadium of Light this summer after the last season took St. Miran back to the Scottish High League.
“I wanted to play for my home as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was all,” Ross told the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish games of Hempdon, which we watched with my father as a child, so the national team has always attracted me.
“This opportunity would only be opened if I succeeded at the club level.”
Among the predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland are names such as Dick Advocate, David Moose, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paolo Di Cannio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he did not experience anxiety as a heir of such firm names in a similar famous club, as he previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
“For me, the success will be measured with a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the High League?”
Because in structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League,” he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I’ll assume I’ve achieved success here only if I manage to take the team back there.”
Ross has been a manager for only three years after spending some time as a assistant in Dubarton and 15 months at Harts' coach office.
He then helped Alao not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Mirane from a falling team into a championship winner in the next season.
Ross shares that he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlippull, Foxcark, St. Myrn and Hamilton Academy.
“I was really on the cross,” he remembered when he took Aloa.
“I really thought being a manager is the best spot for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds weird because I did well, I made good money and I had some significant successes.
But to be a player is sometimes difficult.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and tension at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I really do it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin throughout my conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals research
The summer heat increases revenue of British pubs fighting to survive, but has gained more tension for the chains of restaurants.
Pubs and bar groups reported a sales increase by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenue decreased by 4.8%, statistics indicate.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of the CGA, said: “Due to the long-term sunshine and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup, in July followed a similar model as in June, when the bubbles reported a 2.8% increase, but the restaurants got even stronger.
The decline of 1.8% in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Drinking bubbles and bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the declining movement of restaurants.
Food bubbles also suffered from sunset, but not as much as the owners of restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In bubbles and bars, drink sales jumped by 6.6 percent per month, while in foods there was a 3 percent decline.
Paul Neuman, one of the RSM’s rest and entertainment analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we noticed at the end of April.
The time and influence of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the service sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to suffer, although a decrease in sales by 4.8% per year may be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at the worse time for the food business managers, and only the weather will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will take the desired rest."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the delay in the breakdown of the brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales analyst in the bubbles, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes the performance of 47 operating groups, with a total of £9 billion, and is a solid indicator in the industry.
One in five children hide from their parents’ secret profile in social media
One in five children – some just 11 – has a secret social network profile that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study.
A study conducted among 20,000 high school students showed growth in false Insta pages
News Increased Fears of Publishing Sexual Content Materials
Twenty percent of students said they had a “base” profile that showed their parents.
One in five children – some in 11 – creates a social networking profile that keeps the secret of adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has increased fears that material with sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clear "base" profile that they showed to their parents, while they also had secret profiles.
Mom, who hit her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Directors Conference of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, while half of them acknowledge that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC’s CEO, Mike Bukanan, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers have been tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elide Doyle will be “the voice of the athletes” at the Bordeaux of Light Athletics in Scotland
Alyde Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Light Athletics in Scotland as a director without executive functions of the annual general assembly of the managing body.
Doyle is Scotland's leather athlete with the most achievement and President Ian Biddy has determined this move as a great opportunity for those driving in sports to take advantage of its rich international experience over the past decade.
"Elyd is very pleased with the respect in the leather athletics communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the leather athletics in Scotland will benefit from its attraction," Bithy said.
“I want to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the 200 and 400 meters final at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, adding to his total four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular BBC commentator, lost his ability to walk after receiving a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I got a hit a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show if I will recover and to what extent.
It was an exciting job, but I got a full recovery, I learned how to walk again and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast-feeding pump that compares mothers to cows, shares opinions online
The company that produces breast-feeding pumps shares opinions online with advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are breast-feeding.
To note the launch of the expected “first noise-free breast pump in the world suitable for wearing,” the Elvie consumer technology company launched a ridiculous music video advertising to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives babies to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow circle full of seno, on the background of a song with a text, "Yes, I'm feeding, but you don't see any belt" and "If you haven't noticed, that's not a whim, it's my breasts."
The song continues: "Pump, pump with them, feed babies, pump with them, pump with your girlfriends."
However, the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused online disputes.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the clip received mixed reactions from the spectators, many claiming that it undermines the “fears” of the dairy processing industry.
“A lot of stupid solution is to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth.
The Elvie breast pump is collected discreetly in breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is fully understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breastfeeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Somebody added, "That's so inadequate advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, as a woman admitted that she considered the song "except fun".
“I think the idea is genial.
I'd like to buy that if I'd still breastfeed.
The kidnapping caused me to feel like a cow.
The advertisement is a little bit of a bit, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genial,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “It’s a funny advertising directed to mothers who eat (often at their workplaces or in the toilet) and feel like “cows”.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy processing industry."
At the end of the clip, the group of women reveals that they danced with the discrete pumps placed in their essence.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who are breastfeeding feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely noiseless, there are no wires or tubes and is collected discreetly in a breastfeeding soil that gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even get out as they get out.
Ana Balarin, partner and CEO at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative marketplace.
By drawing a parallel between breast-feeding and breast-feeding cows, we wanted to focus attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with it, at the same time showing the incredible sense of freedom, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump comes into the main news.
During the Fashion Week in London, two children's mother appeared at the designer Martha Yakobovsky's padium, using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly moved to tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained children of immigrants has jumped steadily, although the monthly crossings of the border remain relatively unchanged, partly because the acute rhetoric and policy by the Trump administration has difficulty the establishment of children with supporters.
Usually most defenders are immigrants without documents that fear they will risk their stay in the country if they wish to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential stakeholders and other adults from the family must provide fingerprints, and that data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who wished to become prosecutors of uncomponed minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous criminal records.
Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either prosecutors or members of the prosecutors’ family are illegally living in the country, most of which are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these people,” Albans said.
In an effort to deal with the registration of these children faster, the authorities imposed new rules that require some of them to appear before the court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as was the previous norm, according to reception officials.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their case of legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are defined as inappropriate for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become oppressed or depressed, which may lead to violent blasts or attempts to escape, according to recipients and reports that have gone out of the system over the past few months.
Lawyers shared that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornilo, where the signs that a child has problems are more likely to be ignored due to the extent of the site.
They added that moving children to the "Palatinate City" without giving them enough time to prepare for emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, can harden the injury that many have already fought.
Syria calls for US, France and Turkey’s “Occupation Forces” to withdraw immediately
With a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war has been last eight years.
Mualem, who also assumes the deputy Prime Minister’s office, said that foreign troops live illegally on Syrian land under a pretext for fighting terrorism and “they will take appropriate action.”
“They must be removed immediately and without any conditions,” he said at the meeting.
“The war against terrorism is almost to its end” in Syria, where more than 300,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been violently expelled from their homes.
Damascus will continue to “fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian countries are cleansed” by both terrorist organizations and “any illegal presence of foreigners.”
The U.S. has approximately 2,000 Syrian troops, who mainly train and advise both the Kurdish and the Syrian parts, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the lands destroyed by the war.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said the conditions are tolerable and can return, accusing “some Western countries of “exploding fears” that encourage refugees to stand away.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
“They turn into a political issue that is a completely humanitarian issue.”
The U.S. and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance to restore Syria until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war is reached.
The U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress in Idlib enables progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a widespread attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
However, Muhammed emphasized that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military actions will be aimed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaida-related front “Al Nusra” who will “be destroyed”.
The UN’s Ambassador Stafan de Mistura hopes to soon summon the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to prepare a draft of the post-war constitution of Syria and to make a way to elections.
Mualem explained the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that the panel's work should be limited to a "respect of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no intervention.
Why Trump will win the second mandate
According to this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless – as many liberal viewers are likely to hope – his presidency will not be stopped prematurely due to impunity and scandal.
This would certainly be “the most dramatic end of presidency ever!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, the credit rating has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the preim, compared to 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinner.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama “The Last Candidate”, where he talks about a secretary of the office who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nel Skovell, a veteran writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skovl told me that he replied, "Because he laughed at me."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, Washington’s stories can define the future of Row vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can gather again, as well as the good state of the world economy.
Excluding is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can allow.
And yet, the desire to be informed citizen does not correspond to this in six hours to watch as a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book "Strah"; Paul Mannafort's pilot jacket about the "Dropdown" of the crushed skin of Paul Mannafort's "Dropdown" for $15,000, Postton's "Description" according to a "Dropdown"

When I contacted Mr. Flys this week, at him on the northern coast of Kuwait was sunny, 80 degrees, but he had closed home to watch MSNBC, recording CNN at the same time.
It could not be separated from the TV, especially when Bret Cavanano had to face the Senate’s legal commission, and that depends on the future of the Supreme Court.

Investments are involved in the most controversial competition in the pre-elected place elections in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district receives a flow of money thanks to the reorganization of Congress districts and from there two titles for the same place.
Recently redistributed district in Pittsburgh's predecessor indicated conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his place from another district of partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly awarded the new 17th.
The maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were anti-constitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district broke out a financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Commission on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Commission on Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb is held in Pennsylvania after the difficult victory in the widely discussed partial elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
The position was taken by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won a district of 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. considers imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, after which it withdraws
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners left the management team from the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to respond to the leaders of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nawart earlier this month.
But sanctions were provided only against El Salvador, who in 2017 received about $140 million U.S. aid for the fight against drugs, with a view to development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including disruption of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be harmful to the state of Central America with its unemployment and the percentage of murders.
With the advances of internal meetings, officials from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the burning of migrants to the United States.
But in mid-September, the highest management authorities pointed out that their wish was to hold the conference, thus effectively stopped any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has now announced that he will participate in the conference planned for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the collection, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, wishing to remain anonymous who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move may be the report of Special Advisor Robert Müller on the possible prevention of justice by Mr. Trump, while the report is currently a significant evidence in the public register.
Mr. Müller is claimed to address his investigation and whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign at their attack against our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to take account of this body just when preparing to face voters, as well as perhaps before court meetings made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here and I don't embarrass that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor is that of those like him in Europe.
We all, from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, have to make these elections that will affect how long the fight will take place.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a state strike against Hitler, as soon as the West had enforced him and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the clan.
The course of history depends on such moments, and the unfair march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are faced with a few similar moments.
What should we do if Mr. Trump releases Vice-Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been back since the newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and speculated with the opinion that it was not suitable for a post.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in Times was incorrect.
“How will we react if the new investigation against Bret Kavano, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and lies?
And above all, will we vote on the pre-congressional elections if this forced Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these trials, democracy is waiting for it a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because I got a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once had occupied my embassy house.
She survived, migrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to burn the candlesticks for the Sabbath on that table, wearing a scarf.
With an inheritance like this, how can I not be optimistic for our future?"

Gream Dorans from Rangers is an optimist in confronting Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosted by Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive equality in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will give them a significant chance to move forward by the G League Europe Group.
Contusion in the knees did not allow semi-defender Gream Dorans to play his first match for the season before the question of equality 2-2 with Villareal, but he believes that for Rangers this result can be transformed into a tramp to a larger achievement.
“We won an important point because William is a good opponent,” the 31-year-old footballer said.
“We went into the game with hope that we could win something and we went with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but in general equality seems a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
We took a look at Thursday, another big evening of our matches in Europe.
I hope we will be able to fight for the three points, this will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the previous meeting, but I am sure with the support of our audience we can do everything we can and achieve a good result.
Last year it was definitely hard after everything that happened in spite of my confusions and changes in the club, but now things seem to have moved in the direction of the rules.
The team is good and the boys really have fun, the training is useful.
I hope we will be able to push all our efforts to forget the last season and achieve the desired successes."
Women are worried about their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study shared that they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their husbands.
Only 10 percent spoke to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snajder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance sector.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your husband and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care for you unless you declare your wishes in advance.
Together with your advisor and your family discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a crucial factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a long-term financial institution may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy with monetary value to help you cover these expenses or self-insurance with your funds – if you have cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles at the beginning.
Appoint yourself a healthcare authority so that you have a certain trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Consider also the idea of an author of financial affairs.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incapable.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your adult parents need urgent medical care and travel to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions about medicine and allergies?
Explore these details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s about what doctors will be,” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan."

A man was shot several times with an air gun while he went home in the evening.
The victim, about 40, was located in the Oxford Grove district in Ilfracomb, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, stomach and hand.
Police describe the shooting that took place at about 02:30 a.m. in the British summer time, as a "crash act".
The injured was unable to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are trying to attract witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, expecting the number of dead to rise.
Due to the interrupted communications, aid organizations cannot receive information from the Dongguan region, a northern area of Palu, which is closer to the 7.5-magnetic earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala that are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow coastline on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami were overwhelmed.
Dongala is a region that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) on the coastal edge of the island of Sulawesi.
The regional region, which is less than the province, has a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundations of the central Sulawesi province’s economy, particularly in the coastal region of Dongguan.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovily, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been overturned several times by tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongguan.
Tsunami climbs the western part of Dongguan and in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismical “Pacific Fire Ring” and is regularly disturbed by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and waves of tsunami in recent years:
2004: A strong storm on 26 December on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activated a wave of tsunamis that overflows 14 countries and destroyed 226,000 people across the coastal coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them being in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias along the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8th most inhabited island in Indonesia, Java, activated tsunami, which broke down on the south coast, destroying nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 hits near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake of one of the Mentaway Islands activated a 10-meter-wave tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Suddenly earthquake hit the Peddy Jaya Regiment in Acech, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, tsunami was not activated, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Strength struggling the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of them from the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily without origin.
Sarah Paelin’s eldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Trak Paelin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Paelin, was arrested for allegations of violence.
Paline, 29-year-old, was arrested by Wasila, Alaska, for suspicion of domestic violence, intervention in a report of domestic violence and arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman-known woman tried to call the police to report on alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paline was detained in the Mat-Su pre-detention building and under an unsafe $500 warranty, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he was declared "innocent, certainly" when he was asked for pledge, reports the media.
Paline is threatened for three A-class crimes, which means he can be freed for a period of up to one year and pay a fine of $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B crime, which is punished for one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time a criminal charge is made against Paline.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paline.
His mother, Sarah Paline, called the police to report on the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Veteran Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, intervention in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of abusive substances in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he hit her with a gun in her face.
Sarah Paelin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behaviour with a posttraumatic stress from his Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died of an earthquake, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnetic earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communication network has been interrupted, expecting the number of dead to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
In social networks there are videos that show the moment of collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami wave climbed the coast.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand a death penalty for Syfulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people were killed - a rare punishment that was not executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, was claimed to use a truck rental at Home Depot to carry out the attack in October at the wheelchair near the West Side highway in downtown Manhattan, walking pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and has caused severe physical injuries, according to the intentional notification of a death penalty application filed in Southern District, New York.
According to the judicial document, both charges may end with a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, an extended federal court filed a 22-point prosecution to Saipov, including eight charges of murder related to a missile used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of the IPS.
The attack requires "serious planning and intentionality," the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed as "threateful, cruel and depraved."
"Sifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Ernan Feluki and Alejandro Damien Panuko," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last Southern District of New York has been looking for death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two narcotics, but was subsequently sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was executed in New York City was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a family couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Dark War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan nationalist, did not show a feeling of disgrace in the days and months after the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the investigators that he felt well of what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, the accused said.
He also asked for the ISIS flag in his hospital, the police said.
He pleads innocent in the prosecution, consisting of 22 points.
David Paton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that “they are obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe the decision to seek death sentence instead of accepting a guilty and lifelong jail without the possibility of early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events to all the affected,” Paton said.
The Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor to refuse death penalty.
Parliament Member of Conservatives says NJJIL FARAŽ must conduct negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage refused to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” – as one of the members of the Teresa May’s own party, he proposed him to lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative Deputy in Birmingham, said in March that Britain would "have gone out" if Mr. Farage was a secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced to deal with the deeply divided lines of the party was emphasized by conservatives supporting the remaining that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to maintain its compromised “Chequers” plan, despite the attacks of supporting Brexit, which also support the EU’s stay.
Allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and urge Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bonn told protesters with the slogan "Exit means exit" in Solicol that he wanted to "get Chequers".
He stressed that Mr Farage had to participate in the same way as the others and had to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had ruled, we would have left,” he said.
Wellingborough’s deputy said: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the Chequers plan.
He declared his opposition attitude toward the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be slaves.
We want to create our laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The belief that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain is totally false.”
Andrea Jenkins, the representative of the conservatives, also participated in the meeting, told reporters: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the broad public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually came out of the street and actually helped to be elected.
Please cut "Chequers" and start listening.
In an open message to Ms. May, she added: “Premiers maintain their position when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farag said at the meeting that politicians should “feel pressure” if they plan to change the decision taken after a 2016 referendum.
“It’s now about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to change Brexit and we're gathered here today to say, 'We won't let you go away.'"
He added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge to change Brexit, feel pressure.
“We mobilize the army of the people of this country that helped us defeat Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governmental, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, the supporters left a walk through Birmingham before taking a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Sheep activists had risen flags with "Conservatives against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis played with the conservatives on the security issues of the party's application when it was opened at the conference.
“That’s the people who tell us that Canada’s IT systems and all technology can be available for an impeccable crossing borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a full farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren said he would seriously consider his presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would consider “the possibility of becoming a president” after the November election.
Boston Globe said the representative of the Democrats of Masachusetts had talked about their future during a city council in Western Masachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will be nominated for re-election in November against Republican representative Jeff Deil, who was joint president of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Masachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she can take Trump’s position in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holliouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the Mayor's building after Trump entered office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to apply for a president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our injured government, which includes women at the top.
He was arrested for the death of Sims by LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting on Friday when basketball player Wade Sims was killed by LSU.
Button Rug's police department reported the arrest of Daton Simpson, a 20-year-old, during a press conference at 11:00 eastern time.
They published a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify the man seen on the pictures.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted he was in the crime place, had a gun, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson has been arrested and detained in the police administration of the East Baton Rouge municipality.
Youth with a 6′6′′ rise, grew up in Baton Rouge – Sims participated in 32 matches with 10 outlets as titled last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches per game.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton is increasingly closer to the world title after his team’s instructions helped to defeat Sebastian Fetel
Since Walter Botas was ranked earlier than Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes's team's instructions will play an important role in the race.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two conquests, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made a pit-stop and left Hamilton to deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next round and went out after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to overcome it after a row of maneuver and ride "which forced Ferrari's pilot to release the inner part of the track in order to avoid a second-time punishment of a second-time closure, after being already shut down.
Over my 21st birthday, Max Verstopen started from the back rows of the start grid and was seventh after the end of the first tour.
After that, he even led for a pretty long period of the race, as he decided to change his tyres later than the rest, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly to overcome Kim Raykonen in the battle for the fourth position.
Finally, he entered a pit-stop in the 44th round, but failed to swallow enough in the next eight rounds and ultimately finished the fourth.
It was a tough day as Waltery did a great job all weekend and showed up as a real gentleman when he let me overcome it.
The team has done an extraordinary job to win the first two places on the ground floor,” Hamilton said.
It was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump played with Senator Dayan Finstein at Raley on Saturday for her affirmation that she did not spread the letter by Christine Blaze Ford, which accused the Supreme Court’s applicant, Bret Cavano, of sexual immorality.
During a conversation with Raley in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statements made by Ford before the Senate’s legal commission, but instead comments on how what happens in the Senate shows that people are “bad and unfair.”
“What can happen and the beautiful thing that’s happening in the Senate in the last few days when you see anger when you see angry people and evil people, both deceitful and unrepentant,” he said.
“When you look at publications and dissemination, they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, are you spreading?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document - "Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
We have spread... No, we haven't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Finstein sent the letter in detail about Ford's claims against Kavano in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Finstein denied that this spread had happened from her office.
"I haven't hid Ford's claims, I haven't spread her story," Finnstein told the commission.
"She asked me to keep confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wished."
But her rejection was not well accepted by the president who commented during the rally on Saturday evening: “I will share that this was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language in the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court’s applicant accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president stressed that Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
“They are willing to return their power with all possible means.
“Look at the iniquity, the shame, they don’t care who will hurt, whom they have to overthrow to restore their power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elit League: Dundy Stars 5-3 Belfast Jaints
Patrick Duiler Revealed Two Goals for Jaints Against Dundy
Dundy Stars returned for the Friday loss in the Elite League against Belfast Jaints, won a 5-3 revanche in Dundy on Saturday.
Jayents took two goals early in the match after the hits of Patrick Duiler and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Caunie have been compensating for the hosts before Duier restored the front of Jaiants.
François Bushar was awarded Dundi before the two naked Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to confirm their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elit League for Adam Keef's boys who escaped from the bottom to win Dundy in Belfast with 2-1 Friday evening.
This was the fourth battle between the opponents this season, while Jayants won the previous three matches.
The strike with which Duiler found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Candle McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled the advances by assisting Bowiler four minutes later.
It was an intense start, Sullivan returned the hosts back to the game at 13:10, before Matthew Markard helped to equate with the help of Caunnie at 15:16.
Dwayer tried to take Jayents before the first vacation, noting the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The homes regrouped, and Bushar once again balanced the chances with a strong hit in the door at 27:37.
Caunie and Charles Corcoran have unified efforts to help Nilsen give Dundy's front for the first time at the end of the second half, by giving everything he could and confirming the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Janets, who lost the last four matches of a total of five matches, welcomed as hosts Milton Kins for their next match on Friday.
Flight manager died to make sure hundreds of people on board could escape from the earthquake
The head of flights to Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that an airplane with hundreds of passengers on board managed to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many were unknown by a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, activating a wave of tsunamis.
The strong secondary ruins continued to strike the area and many were captured in a trap from the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Guanavan Aung has refused to leave his position in a tremendous control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufrey Airport.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the track at that time, will be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Control, Indonesia, Johannes Syraith, said that this decision might have saved hundreds of lives, Australia said.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital to another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongguan, Sigi and Button are limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will increase as many bodies are still under the breakdowns and many people cannot be reached," Sutopo Púrvo Nugrocho spokesman said.
Waves reaching six meters desolated Palu, where a mass funeral occurred on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the clinic brings more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
"There are marijuana everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfhand, President of the International Red Cross movement in Indonesia, said before CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia struggles to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army: "Please work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was invaded by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports that a person is unknown after a lagoon accident
The airplane flying in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reports that one person has been announced to have disappeared after he previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the flying plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said they could not contact a male passenger from Saturday afternoon.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requests for more details of passengers, such as age and nationality.
Local people's boats helped rescue passengers and crews after the plane broke into the water while trying to land on the island of Chuuk airport.
On Friday, the authorities reported that seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of which were in a stable state.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of the events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. naval forces said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the trail.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had passed the track.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane has been very low.
“It’s very nice,” says Janes.
Janes tells us that he and the others were able to cross the deep to the crosswater to reach the emergency exit of the flying plane.
He shared that the stewards fell in panic and shouted, as well as that he had suffered a mild injury to his head.
U.S. Naval forces tell us that seafarers repairing nearby have also helped in the rescue action by using a flooded boat to drive people to the shore before the plane crashed into the depths of about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
According to the Safety Airline Network, over the past two decades 111 people have died in flights registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been included in any case.
Analyst exhibits the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded with his statement on the case this Saturday in a repeat trial against a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette from the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of the 29-year-old accused Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette said he had received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, back to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was outside the city on that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said "that's a lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is that Tellis stated that she knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
The mobile phone records suggest that they have been familiar with each other for just a week.
Roulette stressed that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis had deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
"He's got her out of his life," said Hale.
Defence plans to start with its final statements on Sunday.
The court said it expected the proceedings to be presented to the courts later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to trigger negative opinions about the genre by fulfilling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Brussels claims that the hip-hop has diverged from its origin of political statements and involvement in social problems.
They want to return to their roots and promote the conscious hip-hop again.
The Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York Grandpa Judges a Couple After Release for Racist Message
A New York grandmother judges a couple for dismissal due to discrimination after receiving an incorrectly sent message from the mother who complains that she is "the next black skin".
The couple refuses to be racists, as they look like a desire to "exterminate".
Linzy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was ridiculed when she found out that the new child career, Jizzell Morris, was a black woman when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEAEAEAEEA, THE BACKGROUND BLACK," Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and it was twice.
Once she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Morris, stressing that the former African-American girl did not do her job well and she was expecting a Philippines.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a working day afterwards sent home by taxi.
Morris now judges the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding $350 per day for a six-month contract for which she was initially hired, although she had no contract.
“I want to show them, see, you don’t have to do that,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I’m sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed that they were not racists, adding that the cessation of Morris’ employment was a reasonable action, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after they had insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” said his husband Joel Plasko.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have insulted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Think about it.”
Likewise, Plasko claims that his wife was born only two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
Will you attack someone in this situation?
This isn’t really nice,” said the investment banker.
While the case is still under consideration, the public opinion quickly condemns the pair in social networks, rejecting them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers wouldn’t feel a connection with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, tells about the letter: “It’s hard to sit in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s released.
Now it's very funny after we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She shared that her father, who worked as an operator for the BBC, before inspired to write the child book for a little mosquito, would feel optimistic about the possible rejection of the book, and added that he welcomes the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death.
With regard to Paddington, which she describes as a “important member of our family,” she added that her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
“He was a very modest man and he wasn’t very grateful,” she said.
“But since Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child that has achieved something: you’re proud of him, although it’s not actually your business.
I think he's somewhat accepted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits of Paddington himself.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was urgently taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors struggled to save her life.
"He was constantly calling to say that the situation is really bad, he doesn't expect it to survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“After that, Nad called me to say he would die within two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tash, dear, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She's gone a while ago and so everything's over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get tired."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has so far suffered from the loss of her daughter, is climbing on the plane along with other passengers who don’t know the experience she has gone through.
“No one understands,” she told me.
“I had been shaking my head, and my tears kept tears all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this overwhelming feeling of contact with Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Serb women put cards to prevent suicide from bridge
Two women who lost their favorites for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey put a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Mrs. Davis, 45-year-old from Lidney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They’ve always said that his smile is shaking every room.”
However, he rejected his work before he left, and he was in a “really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that this will have some consequences.”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, "to know people who have to go with and who to talk to, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t keep silence – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphrey, a long-time friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner in his life, just after his mother's death.
“He doesn’t share that he feels depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them or nothing.”
She shared that this was a terrible injury to them, but they had to deal with: “It opens a vacuum in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we have to go forward and fight."

Bret Cavano's future is questioned after the FBI starts an investigation
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited duration and a limited range of investigations – perhaps we could unite our efforts,” Mr. Fleck said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the commission would “destroy” despite the confirmed superparty blockage.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his supporters from the Republicans do not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their unwantedness is due to the moment itself.
The pre-elections are only after five weeks, November 6 – if the Republicans are expected to not perform well, they will seriously harm their attempts to be elected their representative in the highest court in the state.
George W. Bush calls senators and invites them to support Mr. Cavano, who works for Mr. Bush in the White House and with his help met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going on after the FBI has made its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavano can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his nomination for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees “reduced” at Kim
South Korean lawyer said the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Chen Un came into power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean ministry, said there were 1127 refugees last year, and they were 2706 for comparison in 2011.
According to Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China as well as the higher sums required by human counterbands are key factors.
There is no official comment by Phenyan.
Most of the Northern refugees eventually get citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located, and moves easier than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMS), which divides the two Koreans.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, often forced them to repatriate.
The relationships between North and South Korea, which are technically still in war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of both sides met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stand in the nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This took place after a historical meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work on a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Jong Ho accused the U.S. sanctions of the absence of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and in these circumstances there is no way to be the first one to disarma ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanato “esterical” and said it was not suitable for the Supreme Court’s office
The minority leader at Congress Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Cavano, "esterically" and stated that he was too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented this during an interview on this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"It wasn't how I couldn't think that if a woman had reacted in this way, they would call it "hysteriatic," Pelocy said about her reaction to Cavanano's witnesses before the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Cavanano emotionally rejected the claims that he had committed sexual immorality over Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both were teenagers.
During his inception word, Kavano was very emotional, at times he almost cried and felt when he discussed his family and his students’ years.
He also categorically condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the allegations against him a “grothestic and coordinated attack on the personality” organized by liberals who are inadequate that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelossi stressed that according to her witnesses, Kavanano proved that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was prejudiced with respect to the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelossi rejected when asked if he would try to discredit Cavanato if he was appointed, and if Democrats would receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say so – if he doesn’t tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he’s unable to enter not only the Supreme Court but also the court in which he is now,” Pelocy said.
Cavano is currently a judge at the Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelossi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the potential decisions of Cavanato regarding the Affordable Healthcare Act or the Row vs. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavano avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now isn’t the time for an itheric, condemned man to enter the court and to wait for us to say, ‘It’s not wonderful,’ he concluded.
Women should also be mastered.
This is a reasonable criticism, after months and years of dispersion of anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinam said 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
"I got huge help from a woman who was executive director somewhere, who shared that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she was angry and crying, she told her interviewer, "You might think I'm sad because she was crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genial."
Tears are allowed in expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood at the beginning.
One of my most clear memories of previous work, in an office, mainly with men, was as once as I climbed out of an unexplained anger, a older woman than I caught me in my neck — a frozen guide I’ve always been scared — and she attracted me to the stairs.
“Never let them see you crying,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have done it to you."
Patricia Schröder, a Democratic Congressman from Colorado at the time, worked with Harry Hart in his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured in an extramarried yacht called "Monkey Business" and resigned from the race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to consider the idea of nomination for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” she said 30 years later, laughing.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and the last thing they wanted to happen was that another one appeared.
Someone called the situation “Snow and the Seven Juice.”
Since she is late in the campaign, she leaves with the acquisition of funds and decides she will not stay in the competition unless she manages to collect $2 million.
The battle has been pre-defeated.
She understands that some of her supporters who give $1000 to men would only give $250 to her.
“Do you think I get a discount?” she said.
During his speech that he said he would not continue with an official campaign, it was filled with so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported it, dissatisfaction to the system, because of which it is so difficult to collect money and you can turn to voters, not to delegates, as well as angry against sexism.
“A man might think I’ve got a nervous break,” Mrs. Schröder remembers how the media reacted.
“Nobody can think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would write on my graveyard?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve in Beijing
The first shootings in the trade war between the United States and China were obsessive, and while the battle is still taking speed, a break between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning clutch this year, paying taxes to China’s export key elements, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of the tension occurred this week with the new tariffs that affect the production of $200 billion (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Every time, Beijing was repaying new duties of five to ten percent of U.S. goods for $60 billion.
China refused to respond to any U.S. attack and is soon unexpected to ignore the second-largest world economy.
To reject Washington means to submit to the requests, but to put a head publicly before Washington would be too shameful for China’s President C.J. Jinping.
And yet, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure from the trade war with the U.S. can help China in the long run to reduce mutual dependence on both economies.
“The fact that an accelerated political solution can create conditions for a economic crisis in any of the two countries is actually more dangerous than observers had previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, Asian co-worker on issues related to the New American Security Center Expert Group.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said.
Syria said she was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and prayed for help in the restoration of the country devastated by the war for more than seven years.
In a statement to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem stressed that the conditions in the country are improving.
“Today the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to their normal state.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and food.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any aid in restoring the devastated state.
But he stressed that no conditional aid or aid will be accepted from countries that have funded the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, overcoming the US team with a final score of 16.5 of 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six additional losses on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14.5 points that guaranteed the victory over the United States.
The U.S. star, Phil Michelson, who appeared weakly during most of the tournament, stopped his first hit on the 16th hole (with "Par" 3) in the water with which he lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has played greatly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament that reached the balance of 5-0-0 since the competition was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spiet lost a catastrophic 5&4 by the player in Europe's team, located at the lowest ranking in the ranking – Torbjorn Olsen from Denmark.
The world ranking driver, Justin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 by Ian Paulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran with eight participants in the Ryder Cup, became a European with the most winning points in the tournament for all times, increasing its assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stand.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he called me and believed in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the cup again.
The team is the most important thing, and I am happy that I have managed to help,” Garcia said after Europe’s victory.
He handed over to his companion John Ram, who won the American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to win Tiger Woods, yet I grew up as I saw him playing,” 23-year-old Ram said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and his overall balance of the Ryder Cup is now 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 major titles – an indicator on which he departs only to Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team had difficulties throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Ride, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-grade golf all day in the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furrick shared after a disappointing performance of the team: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'll take the hat from Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players were very good.
We will regroup, discuss the important issues with the United States Association of Professional Golfers and our Leader Cup Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You don't want to take off your opponent's hat.
We were just overwhelmed."
