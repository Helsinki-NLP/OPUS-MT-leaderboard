In the UK, which continues to grow, as part of a large contribution of the UK's $2.8 billion market of cosmetics, which continues to grow, while modes and household goods sales are falling, the largest segments of cosmetics will be tested in eleven filiales across the country. If they proven successful, they will expande to further filiales next year.
Inversions in cosmetics coincide with the search of supermarkets for ways to use differentially for television, microwave equipment and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the volume of his offer of cosmetics for the first time doubles up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existantes series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and mark areas similares to those in stores like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a reluctance of its makeup series “Boutique”, so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that younger customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Store of Parfum Trader will test in two Sainsbury's branches sales points. The first sales point was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year in Selly Oak.

The previous attempt of the Supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacies departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but it ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenues from branches of drug dealer's branches into supermarkets.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's 281 branches of pharmacy store to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for 125 million pounds britanicos 3 years ago.
The company announced that Lloyds will play a role in the plan as well as Lloyds will add a widespread range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in co-workers specially trained that are available as consultants.
Our brand range is customized to all the needs. Due to the fascinating environment and locations inexpensives, we are now atractive destination for shopping cosmetics, which challenges the way of shopping today."

Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent presentation of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion dominante in the 19th century and part of the history writing of a figure, which many think it is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith (Goldsmith) said to Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps end of the 19th century more than today than anyone who considers Parliament to pressure from outside, in his case naturally by monarchie, by monarchie.
Whether it's a totally valid representation, it's subject to continuation of history discussions.

More than 20 million viewers have seen listening to Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million spectators saw on Thursday in six television networks, the impressive statements of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman Christine Blasey Ford, nominated for Supreme Court, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the TVs suspended their regular program on Friday because of a turning in the last minute: one negotiated agreement by Jeff Flake, senator from Arizona, according to the FBI, initiating a weekly investigation of accusations.
Ford notified the Senate Justice Committee to 100% confident that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, that she was injuring and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement, he was 100% certain that this was not happening.
It's likely that more than those reported by Nielsen, 20,4 million viewers have seen audition.
The company identified the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems to measure numbers of viewers in offices.
In order to bring this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of viewers in a play-off football game or in a Oscar.
The Broadcasting Fox News Channel, whose moderators of opinion-oriented support strongly the nomination of Kavanaughs, according to Nielsen, recorded the highest number of all networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers of the day-to-day hearing.
ABC was the second place with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS, according to Nielsen, had 3,1 million viewers, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, CNN 2,52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was in the drama of Friday the central figure.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a declaration that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras by CNN and CBS, as protesters in the lifting seat in the way to a hearing of the Justicial Committee, injuring him loudly with words.

“I am right here before you,” said one woman.
"Doesn't you believe that he's saying the truth to the land?"
"Hun har power, and many women are poor," she said. "Hun har power, and many women are poor."
Flake said, his office had published a declaration and supplemented before the lift chair closed that he would have more to say at the consultation before the committee.
All cable and radio networks were transmitted live hours later, when the Justicial Committee should vote on transferring the nomination of Kavanaughs to vote for the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said, he would do this only provided that FBI, as well as the Democratic Minority, demands prosecution of accusations against candidates in the next week.
Flake, partly, convinced by interlocuting with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then various senators, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was evident that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes for confirmation of Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump invoked FBI investigation of accusations invoked against Kavanaugh.

Livingston lost chances against freely playing guests
Holts team would have had to be leader long before the hit, since his directity faced Rangers with the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but it became slower at the gate, then Alan Lithgow could shoot just a long after he was investigated to meet Craig Halkett's head over the gate.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the gate was determining.
The Rangers left a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson both brought Menga in a shooting position. This shot the door with a ball contact from the center of the strafframe.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but the defence of the hosts couldn't overcome, and the gateguard Liam Kelly remained largely intact.
This pattern continued in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defende.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers Tower Guard Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow swallowed the ball from another standard situation from Livingston.
The Flanken regaped to Livingston’s strafframe and were regularly expelled from the peripheral area, while two penalties were rejected – one of Halkett against Glenn Middleton, and one of Glenn Middleton, and one of Glenn Middleton, and one of Glenn Middleton, and one of Glenn Middleton, and one of Glenn Middleton, and one of the hand game.
“Phenomenal” de Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were unexpectedly adorned, and they were overflowing the expectations of this uplifting trend.
Their gameplay and their team have scarcely changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt has been arrogant for the way in which he has guarded the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Capitan Halkett was great and led an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept trab during the entire game.
The Rangers failed to inspire.

US should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
Given China’s intensified activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its cost of research in this field, says Investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of KI in various areas of the US government, although the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented plan last year: The country plans to become the number 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
"Duplication of budget for KI Research would be given the fact that all other countries are so much further behind USA, a good start. We are looking for next KI breakthrough," said Lee.
The duplication of the funds could duplicate the chances that the next major KI success would be achieved in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” publicated this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who investe in one of China’s leading KI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a KI system, which defeated the American Othello player highest positioned. Later, he was leader in Microsoft Research and president of Google Release in China.
Lee awarded previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked the date of the next competition, since he wanted to help in identifying the next visionary.
According to Lees Words, researchers in the USA often need to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Non China takes off academic top powers, sino corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, Google and other technology companies have suspended correlations from universities that are going to work on KI in recent years.
According to Lees, a change in immigration policy of the United States could also favor the efforts of the United States for KI.
"I think that in the field of KI promos, people should offer automatically Greencards," he said.
In July 2017, China’s Council of State presented its plan for the development of next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations granting funds to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Initially this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to participate in Industry and Science, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month that DARPA would invest $2 billion in the initiative “AI Next”.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests over $100 million annually in KI Research.
In the meantime, in the US laws on the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, it has not done anything for months.

After that, Ayr constructed his predecessor by a Climo attempted by Stafford McDowall, after that, a long break occurred due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field of play.
Then the captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and again, Melrose lets the extra man pay at the end of a phase of enormous pressure by a non-increased attempt of Bruce Colvine.
But the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson for tackling without ball against Climo received a yellow card, MacPherson gained from the criminal gaze from a touchdown behind the predecessor Ayr package.
Climo augmentated, like almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxkick and send Gregor Henry Flanking player to the fifth attempt of the home team.

John Edward: Language Knowledge for World Citizens
Scottish independent schools continue to characterize themselves by academic excellence. This continued with further excellence examination results in 2018, and only underpined by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are striving to take care of their students and their parents at the highest level possible.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector educativo, que designe un curriculum adaptable y puede implementar en la realidad, we considere que lenguajes modernos siguen siendo populares y desirables in the schools as electives.

If you speak with him in his own language, then you will find his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year realized that languages with the highest rates of living are top of the ranking lists of independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages obtained Note A in higher examinations.
Based on data collected from 74 SCIS Schools, 72 per cent of the students in Mandarin obtained Note A during the highest examinations, while 72 per cent of the students who studied German, 69 per cent of the students who studied French, 63% of the students who studied Spanish, and 63% of the students who studied Spanish, also obtained Note A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will be necessary for children and young people in the future.
Languages today are considered as electives as STEM fields (Natural Sciences, Engineering, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey of the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17% of the reasons why employers denominated problem of occupation of open jobs were associated with deficiency of language skills.

That's why it's important for today's children to investe in language lessons now.
Children who speak several languages, particularly languages of developing countries, will have better chances to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, all schools are taught different languages.
Several schools will concentrate on the classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, e.g. Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests are, in independent schools will always be chosen by a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scotland Independent Schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepare children and equipar them with the skills necessary for their success, as well as the future looks like.
In this context, in a global economic environment, it cannot be counted that languages continue to be fundamental for the future of the country, therefore this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication ability".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this option, diversity and excellence.

Ryder Cup 2018: Team of USA shows ready to fight to maintain hope for individual on Sunday
After three unilateral rounds, the four partys in Saturday afternoon could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendel of the moment is a pure invention as a sport concept, but one in which players really believe, and that's especially when competitors like this.
So, where’s the moment of their opinion?
"Sie lanzaban 6 points, and now it's 4 years, so I think that's a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when he left the playground.
Europa, of course, is favorable, and stands for 4 points, while follows 12 further.
"Americans, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente, decisamente.
Spieth era inextinguished from the rain to the green and proceeded with a good example.
"The goodtural entusiasm crush became large in the next course of his round when he cut a important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both after he and Thomas had left two holes with two points back."
Sein Putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, lost a similar screaming that conclude that the American team isn't out of the game yet.
"I really need to get me up and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each player.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, as the only player of the Ryder Cup.
"Europa's disproportionate but sympathetic duo is at four to four points and nothing can't do wrong.
"Moliwood" wasn't the only couple who didn't beat Bogey on Saturday morning, but they also had to avoid Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and nine holes behind on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently between them and the amount of flowing energy that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who sealed a possible European victory during the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both of them at the same time in different holes.
"Speak of Europe's reputation, but it would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
"B Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim Sim
Nobody can help them from the climb on Sunday.
Four and four couples are because of interactions between couples, advices that give or not give them, and the way of how a strategy can change rapidly, so fascinating look from close.
Europeans have played better as teams and have been a great leader in the last day but this four round also showed that the team of the United States is ready to fight what some, particularly in the United States, had desperate.
Europe will go on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6 in leadership
Europa, after the Four and Four Parties of the Saturday against the United States, stands forward 10:6, and walks with solid predisposition in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genial play duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories over Tiger Woods, who struggled with difficulties, and thus could score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to regain the trophie lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four in the morning against the American team playing wrongly and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, USA triumphed for more resistance and wond two matches, but the remainder was incapable of recovering.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 individuals played Sunday in order to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood wined as the first European newborn four points in turn, while he and Molinari, baptised after a sensational weekend "Molliwood", first wined as the second duo in history of Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
"After they've beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they've harmonized perfectly, and they've beat the enchanted Woods and the American Neuling Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4.
Woods, who had been clipped through two matches on Saturday, made his brilliant climbing occasionally, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parties and seven in consecutive.
Justin Rose, who refreshed during the Fourth of the morning, returned to the Fourth Party as partner of Henrik Stenson. She won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and third in the world.
However, for Europe, in this pleasing day of winding southwest of Paris, it did not all according to their ideas.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, the three-major winners, set the Messlatte for Americans, with two points Saturday.
"They won 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm, Jon Rahm, Ian Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 matches in 4&3 after they lost the first two holes, and they won Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 matches in 4&3 matches in 4&3 matches in 4".
In Ryder Cup's history, it was the first two times that a team came back after it went to the individual with a remaining of four points. However, as title holder, Furyk's team is sufficient for a non-decision to maintain the trophie.
After two days they were standing in a second place, it doesn't seem like they could start an attack on Sunday.
North Korea Refugees One Side Destruction Without Confidence
The secretary of North Korea said Saturday before the UN that continued sanctions would deepen their misconfidence against the United States and, under these circumstances, the country would not abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea took "good willing action substantial" last year, "for example, it stopped testing atoms and rakets, decomposing lands of nuclear tests and committed to not multiplication of weapons and technologies nuclears."
“Nom, we no see reacción correspondente de Estados Unidos,” he said.
“Non confie in America, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not break ourselves unilaterally first.”
While Ri reiterated the North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase” approach in denuclearization, wherein North Korea would rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in so far as she had not rejected a unilateral denuclearization from prior to prior, as it did Pjöngjang in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump during the first summit between a president of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had assured to work on "denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to finalize officially the Korea War led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to demands after a restriction of stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States stand up on "primary denuclearization" and increase the pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by forced, and are even opposed to "declaration of the end of war"," said Ri.
“The assumption that we can force sanctions into the knees is a spinning of people who don’t know about us.
La problem, however, es que las sanciones continuas profundizan nuestras infidelidades."
Ri did not go on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which had highlighted the U.S. head of the United Nations at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.

However, the tone of Ris Rede differed enormously from his speech last year, when the UN General Assembly said it is inevitable to target North Korean rakets on the continent of the United States, after "the evil president" Trump Kim had nominated "raketman" for suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened the "full destruction" of North Korea last year, overthrew Kim in the United Nations with pride in his courage in terms of the deforestation step, but said that there is still a lot of work to work and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday, he did not have a time frame for it, "Of it takes two years, three years, or five months, no matter."
China and Russia argued that UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps implemented.
"Make Pompeo, US minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday to UN Security Council of the United Nations: "The implementation of sanctions of the Council of Security must continue to be energized and energized until we achieve the total, definitive, definitive and certified denuclearization".
"The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in order to excrete Pyongyang programs for nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles financially.
Pompeo meets Ri at the edge of UN General Assembly and then said he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea 3 times this year, but his last trip wasn't successful.
In July, he claimed, in departure from Pjöngjang, that progress had been achieved, only for hours later to be accused by North Korea, he claimed "associable demands".
North Korea pleaded this month in a meeting with Moon, a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took “adequate measures”.
He said, Kim told him that the promised "accessive measures" were security guarantees that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course, enough to sleep
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in this year's primary study get more sleep. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture, stay awake with caffeine and learn all night.
A scientist has found that the students of the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course in life after having held a speech about the effects of sleep withdrawing on learning.
“After that’s the end of the year, one girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know this now, in my last year?’
After their words, nobody ever told her how important it is to sleep. That surprised me,” he said to The Telegraph.
This year's first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport performance and also improve general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Services, said, University decided to introduce the course after she found that students suffered under heavy sleepout during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the image of a room in a living house and click on cups of coffee, curtains, training shoes and books. In this section, they get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deficiency on the sport performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants informed that long-term sleepout could increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke and cancer.
Afterwards, they will be encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university field with interactive symbols.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
“Pero we believe that they have the right to know this – just like you have the right to know how decision to smoke affects your health,” adds Prof. Czeisler.
“The orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa orgullosa.
He said, as it was sufficiently good to sleep, the "secret gun" of all students should be against stress, fatigue, and anxiety. In addition, it was possible to avoid gains of weight, as sleep excretion puts the brain into the mode of hunger, so that they would be hungry constantly.
Raymond So, 19-year-old student of California, who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, assisted Professor Czeisler in the design of the course. In his first year in Harvard, he studied one of his courses last year.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar program of study before they take their study at the Competition-oriented University.
According to Recommendation of Professor Czeisler, the students should stand up for the time of sleep and the time of awakening, and be aware of the negative effects of the "blue light" which surge from screenshots electronics and LED lights, and can take away the rhythm of zircadian taks. This leads to problems while sleeping.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forcing Gerrards Players
The Rangers lost another game outer when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrards' team played a 0:1 match at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win its first outward victory since the 4:1th triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as managers, so his team remained eight points behind the first Premiership in Ladbrokes Premiership with remote lead hearts.
Menga met 7 minutes ago, and the inspirational Rangers seemed to have no chances to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston ascends to the third place, sitting just behind Hibernian.
Rangers also threaten other troubles, after Calum Spence Line Judge had to be treated by a apparently thrown object from the guest block.
Gerrard took eight changes in the team, the Ayr overthrowed and reached the semifinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stayed with the same 11 Livingston players who took Hearts from a point last week, and should be excited how his well-trained team held opponents under pression.
Although Rangers dominated the ball possession, Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
I've got to get a gate after only two minutes, when Mengas first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. I've got to get a gate after two minutes. I've got to get a gate after two minutes.
Then a long freelancer of Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot at the back of the foss.
Rangers took control, but their game acted in the last third rather desperate than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was evidently convinced that after a quarter-hour of conflict between him and Steven Lawless, he should have received a penalty, but arbitrator Steven Thomson, whose complaints of Colombians were not validated.
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half, but the ex Ibrox Tower Guard Liam Kelly had hardly difficulty with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hits in 34th minute might not match the game history, it's not to refute that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Rangers again couldn't play with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.

Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor stayed well standing and defeated Jacobs before Lithgow un headball out of the corners.

Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radio activity, a invention, which ultimately led to the device known as Geiger Counter.
The Geiger Counter, who became a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, e.g. film "Bells of Coronado" (1950) with apparently inusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
When you place these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in minerals."

Kanye West left a Pro-Trump Tirade after his appearance at SNL, carrying a MAGA game ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't work well.
Kanye West was deployed at Saturday Night Live in studio, after a widespread award of US President Donald Trump and said he would go for 2020 as presidency candidate.
After he had sung his third title of the night, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-American Big Again Cup, he continued with a canonada against Democrats and insisted once again that he supported Trump.
“I am so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump?’
“If I would worry about racism, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
SNL started the broadcast with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywoodstar made a funny of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before Senate’s Justicial Committee on Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual abuse.
Although the recording of West Shimptirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comic Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication over West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had difficulties behind the scene because of his head covering.
“Sie rushed me back to the scene.
“You have said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
I've sent me!
"And then they say that I am in a nuanced area," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West interrogee: "Will you see the area disgusted?" "Will you see the area disgusted?" "Will you wear my supermancape because that means you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to advance with the world?"
Try it with love."
Variety notifies that his observations were deleted twice by the public, and that SNL agents affected adversely, and that was noted in the magazine, “It was dead in the studio.”
West was late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a speech of the title "I love it" in which he was dressed as perrier bottle.
Wet received support from Candace Turner, Chairman of the Group of Conservatives TPUSA Group, who tweeted: “At one of the courageousest spirits: DANKE, DANKE, THAT YOU HAVE FROM TOUR MASSE ENEGEGENTEST HAST.”
However, Karen Hunter, the Talkshow moderator, twittered, West is simple to be himself, and that's absolutely wonderful.
“Mas intenciona, intenciona, NU BUY GRATIS PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL, PERSONAL.
He's free.
The same thing goes for us,” she adds.
The rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The being known as Kanye West).
He's not the first artist who changes his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacks toxical masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of Jon Snow in HBOs of violence characterized by medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero. He said that such rolls on the screen would result in that boys often felt need to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said, he thought something was wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31 years old, who also joined Game of Thrones, admitted that solution to the problem is "very important".
“Personalmente, i find the question very important in this moment, what happened wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What do we have learned to grow up men about the problem that we observe now?”
Harington believes that television due to the characters of very masculine may be partly responsible for increasing toxical masculinity.

I think that's really one of the great questions of our time: how can we change that?
"For at the young men, there's clearly something wrong."
In addition, he agreed in the interview that after the end of the series, he would not participate in Prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones next summer, but had "sufficiency of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington is seen in a new edition by Sam Shepards "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.

HIV/Aids: China Reports Rise of 14% in New Cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Solo in the second quarter 2018, circa 40.000 new cases were reported.
Contrary to the past, transfer occurred in the overwhelming majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost reduced to zero, according to Chinese Health Officers at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In China, the number of people living with HIV and Aids has increased by 100.000.
HIV transfer via sex is a problem acute in the LGBT Community of China.
Homosexuality was descriminalized in China in 1997, however, diskrimination of LGBT Community should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately married women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection in relation to sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, inter alia, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.

“Johnny English – Man Lives Only Three times” – weak spionageparodie with Rowan Atkinson
"Johnny English" franchise "Johnny English" ("Johnny English - The Spion who promised it") in 2003, "Johnny English - Now Just Just Right Stopping" " (Johnny English - Now Just Just Right Stopping)
Ironical self-parodia about the subject, as evidently we are talking about, becomes a new exportable chance for the nation?
The licensing of the glorious, cutting grimasts and inkompetent Johnny English was prolonged for the second time to massle. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for kinobeschuckers in non-english space.

In addition, the figure originally was based on chaos behind travellers and international secret agents, playing Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV spots.
Johnny English's last adventure has one or two beautiful moments.
I liked how Johnny English se aproximo a helicopter in a weapon of medieval times, y rotor blade de rotor briefed to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics takes place ahead, but humor appears rather weak and strange overflowing, particularly because also the "serious" film series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" offer self-certain comedian elements.
Humor appears to be more oriented to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy mischicks aren't so incredible and focused like Atkinson's Stumm Film Gags in the role of Bean.
Now the eternal current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
“Un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un
This is the last strohhalm for the Prime Minister, a buzzed and agitated figure, which already stands before the complete collapse because of their political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not give much with which she can work
Your Secret Service Advisors inform you that all the active spies have been eliminated and therefore you have to take someone from your retirement.
Johnny English, who now works as teacher in a posted institution, but there is a non-official lesson in the work as undercover agent. There are a few gags, since English offers a spionage academie memorable of the School of Rock.
English will be returned to Whitehall to a emergency meeting and will be reconciliated with his ex-tested severe companion Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is something confused.
Batman and Robin, who always make everything terriblely wrong in secret service of your Majesty, are back in action, where they meet Olga Kurylenkos de beautiful Femme Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is in danger of bans of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve computer problems UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the Great Late: When Kellner dresses, they set a nice French restaurant in fire, they take care of chaos when they distorsionate luxury yacht a bordo de Voltas, and English solves pure anarchie while trying to make a use of a virtual reality house head with the inner set of Voltas
Although in this last sequence all registers are taken, but it's so sympathetic and funny too, the subject is already discussed in detail in the television of children.
Heavyly moderate fabric.
Like the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: "Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson don't give a role that's really just his talent?"
Labour strives to work on a plan, after which British work four days in the week, but must be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party (Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyns) ought to considere a radical plan, which provides Brits to work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The Partie seeks to report that managers of the company transfer to workers the employees the savings obtained by KI Revolution (Artificial Intelligence) in the form of an additional day free free.

According to sources, the idea "adequate" to the economic agenda of the party and their plans to move balance in the country in favor of workers.
The transfer to a four-day week was promoted by the Trade Union Congress as a possibility for workers to take advantage of the benefits of changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: “At the end of the year, it is expected that a policy review will be announced.
"Un cambio no se produce durante la noche, pero una semana de trabajo de 4 días es un esfuerzo que coincide con la approche del Partio de restaurar equilibrio economico a favor de los trabajadores, así como con la strategia general de la politica industriale del Partio."
Labour Party wouldn't be the first party to support such a idea. Green Party already promised during the general election campaign 2017 to introduce a 4 day week.
No, in the present day, the approach isn't supported by the Labour Party.

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy expressed in newspaper "60 minutes" if FBI investigation in Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has resigned a vote on his appointment as Judge of Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the results of the Authority could have influenced Senators Republicans to gain their support.
In an interview Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley interrogated senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, Republican Senators, in a statement, whether FBI could bring something day to day, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his companion from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
"I'm told in court that I'm talking to judge Kavanaugh.
"Kann'o? "--"Kann'o?--"Kn'o?-"-"Kn'o?-"-"Kn'o?-"-"Kn'o?-"-"Kn'o?-"-"Kn'o?

But Graham's voice appears to be rocked in stone.
"Mia opinie se da , Brett Kavanaugh and it should be putted in a bombe ," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what Brett has contested this vehement", adds Graham, rushed to Christine Blasey Ford.
“Everybody who calls them, they couldn’t confirm them.”
It's 36 years now.
"I can't see a change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty during this festival?
The Global Citizen Festival celebras in New York City this Saturday, an annual musical festival with an impressive lineup of Stars and an impressive mission – combating poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year, will be visited for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the actual goal of the event: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of Global Poverty Project. Under this project, a group of international interests attempts to combat poverty, motivating more and more people to participate actively in the fighting of poverty.
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event (the second option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks. Include actions like volunteer work, communications with a leader politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the target – combating poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
¿Es la idea de concebir un cool concierto gratis gratis, una manera sensual de convincer otros de que es hora de actuar, o simplemente otro caso de un so-called Clicktivism – si usted crees que, signando una petición online, o transmitiendo un Tweet algo de Tweet?
Global Citizen has notified that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters and achieve different targets.
“These actions have contributed to stimulating leaders of the world to announce commitments and strategies worth over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2,25 billion people by 2030.
Initial 2018, the Group citate 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which $10 billion already paid or invoked per fundraising.
According to the group, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers sitting in the United Kingdom who have committed to support children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Ruanda fight undernutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments nationales, and citizens globals like you, we can make social injustice of subnutrition a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also notified that, after more than 5,000 actions inviting Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the Government announced financing of The Power of Nutrition project, which would reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, i.e., the question of why Global Citizens can combate extreme poverty,
“Y ellos respondieron: ‘Será un camino largo y durmable, con altitudes y altitudes.’
But, like the big civil rights movements and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, since we are stronger and influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and Janelle Monáe, are the artists of this year's event in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are moderators.

Zinke addressed the participants of the event of Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is known as the "Steve of the Power Consumer" in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, and found that they are practically identical.
“Usage and replacement of fuel is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while he denominated Russia “One Trick Pony” with a fossil fuel dependent economy.
The statements were issued when Trump’s government was about expanding exports of gas natural liquid to Europe, replacing Russia, which is much cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, officials of the government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump Berlin became "Prisoner" Moscow.
Moscow has insisted several times that North Stream 2-Pipeline valued $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, to constitute a project economic exclusively.
The Kremlin argumentate that Washington's massive resistance against the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think, we all think that energy should not be used as a means to exercise pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," - agreed Alexander Novak, ministro de la Energy de Rusia, after a meeting with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow, September.
U.S.A. has recepted air wind from Germany, which confirmed his promise to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federal Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to withdraw from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a great problem when a third country interceptates in our supply of energy", declare BDI Dieter Kempf, CEO of BDI, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.

US ambassador pleaded China with "Propaganda Advertising" of Tyranny
A week after a Chinese official newspaper had posted a four-sided announcement in a American newspaper declaring the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, Ambassadors of the US in China accused Beijing, capital of China, of Beijing, of using the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump went to China Daily's payable adhesion in the Des Moines Register, the most selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of intervening in Congress elections in the US on 6 November, a accusation that China argues.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has attempted to intervene in US elections correspond to US officials’ statement to Reuters; a new phase of a escalating campaign, which Washington has created for Washington to press China.
While it is normal that foreign governments turn advertising for promoting the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an outsourcing trade war, with taxes on imports for both countries.
China’s taxes for taxes at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa, supporting the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, which exports largely agricultural products to China, reported that Beijing workers, owners of farms and corporations have damaged.
China, according to Branstad in a commentary in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now duplicate this tyranny by sending propaganda ads in their own free press in the USA.
“By spreading their propaganda, the government of China claims in America the best tradition of free expression and independent press, locking the country’s paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find the newspapers here in Beijing only in limited number of contradictions, and you will not find real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese might have about the alarmant economic development of China, considering the fact that the media are firmly in hand of the Partid Communist of China", he wrote.

Republican electorates pre-interim elections with debacle around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, supporting and defending candidates for the Supreme Court, in view of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned against anti-reaction during the next intermediate elections, particularly women.
The mood in this connection was extreme stressed, and the majority of Republicans have already stated that they continue with a vote.
“Those things can’t be done backwards,” said Grant Reeher, professor of Political Science at Maxwell School of the Syracuse University The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute precedent of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for a FBI investigation is sufficient to employ voters angry.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and not even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, premier consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
"November is coming!" demonstrants in the Senate called Friday morning, when Republicans who controlled the Justicy Committee decided to hold Kavanaughs' nomination, in spite of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, reported Mic.
"Democratic entusiasmo and motivation are a very important subject," said Stu Rothenberg, an unpartisan observator politics of the news page.
“Menmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmen
"But it could be higher, particularly in electorates in front and in younger electorates, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don't like presidents, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their accusations of sexual assault against candidates of the Supreme Court, observers argued that contrareaction could be consequence if Republicans promulga confirmation.
“This situation is a shame for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, ex-president of Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the board, the final vote, or the revision of Kavanaughs; it's also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have treated it," declare Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group supporting elections of democrats.
Americans, however, seem to be inconsistent, who must believe them because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, while a little greater share is on the side of the last.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the surveys were convinced definitivamente, o probable, de Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they were convinced definitivamente, o probable, de Kavanaugh's faith.
38 % suscite que Kavanaugh considere que Kavanaugh probabilmente o definitivamente menti, mientras que 30 % deduce Ford.
After Flake’s pressure, FBI currently investigate the accusations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
"Ford made a declaration of state that a 17-year-old was attacked by Kavanaugh, drunk Kavanaugh, last week before Senate's Justicial Committee.
Ramirez argued that candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice had evolved his genitality against her when they were at a party during their time studying in Yale in the 1980s.

The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the Open Source Platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who receive access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee affirmed that the intention behind Inrupt was "Weltherrschaft".
“Non, we must be active now,” he said about Startup.

His two uncles debuted Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the uncle, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the monument was revealed just 100 years after the hero's birthday, for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lt. Vann conducted his batallion on Canal de Saint-Quentin 29 September 1918; through dense nebels and under severe sweat of field canons and armors of machinery.
Later he went forward to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest tapestry" before he deactivated with a field weapon at the single entrance and disabled three of the military units.
Lieutenant Vann was fired 4 October 1918 by a German Scharf Shield; a little more than a month before the end of war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the acts of his grandfathers were something that he never could be justified, and at the same time something that makes a humiliated.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he placed a crown in the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann adds that he feels very proud to be able to participate in parade, and adds that the integrity of a real hero will become visible mainly by supporting a lot of people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see a exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
San Jose's Bill contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in United Kingdom on Channel 5.
Around 6 p.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare for their fight, the spectators in the United Kingdom spaghettied as if they could see Peppa Pig.
Some remained intact after they stayed awake up to early morning hours to see particularly the battle.
One fan described on Twitter the shift to the trick film figure as a somewhat bad joke.
"Due to a rule of government, this content will be classified as free of teenagers, so it was necessary to be converted to a child broadcast at 6:00 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President Senior in Marketing and Communications at Bellator, when he was interrogated about the transfer.
"Pappa, svin, precis."
Scott Coker, CEO de Bellator, notifikouse de la empresa de la plan de la expiration de la empresa, de la plan de la plan de la expiration de la empresa, de la plan de la plan de la presentación de la presentación de la observación de la anciane de la Gran Bretagne, de la plan de la plan de la presentación de la plan de la prestación de la prestación de la prestación de la prestación de la empresa.
“I think this problem could have been solved already during the repetitive game,” he said.
“Pero es 6:00 p.m. di a Sunday with visitors in the UK, and we will not solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday our local time there.
But we'll stay there.
At the exchange was a lot of communication. It went very nice each other and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical disturbance.
Ignorably, it was a problem by the government.
I promised you, that's not going to happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 combats, like normally. And we have tried to give fans the best possible experience.

Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic Games, says that he has grown up with the feeling of being subordinate to all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old meant that he only realized that he was different from the other one in the next school.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he had discussed the subject of homosexual rights to encourage others.

Mickelson, who currently is not in shape, sits at Ryder Cup Saturday on replacement bank
Phil Mickelson, American Phil Mickelson, will play a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must make a lot of effort so that all this won't become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays the 12th time at the event, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk for Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday to the replacement bank.
Rather than standing in the center of the event, the five major winners spent his day twice shooting others and working on his game, in hopes to solve problems that cause him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the direct golfer, and so no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where balls defected are punished regularly.
And as if the place itself wouldn't be so excitant enough, Mickelson meets in the nineteenth game Sunday on the perfectist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Newling in these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If Americans with four points remaining at the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could be absolute decisive.
Furyk affirmed intimately to Mickelson, and no could add much to him.
"He had perfected his role in clarity, gave me a clip on the back, setzte his arm around me, and thought that he would be ready for tomorrow," he said.
“Han har en masse tillits.
He belongs to the world famous personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I've seen a lot, but now it's been done, and it's what's been waiting for.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for the majority of Ryder Cup games performed Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race, which never matched entirely the top points of his personal record.
Mickelson could record 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, though Furyk reported that solo the team had enriched his presence.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few pieces, and he's a great man popular among the whole team," he said.
“I think the young players were happy to meet him this week and it was nice to see them.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Capitan Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be finished with the progression soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European Team, knows from experience that a great predecession that leads to the last single games in Ryder Cup, can quickly become a disagreable situation.
The Dance debuted 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point predecessor against the Americans, but only barely crossed the target line and started with the least possible predecessor and achieved a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The thought remains that we had a great advancement in Valderrama, we had a great advancement in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we lost, but only little,” Bjørn (fotografated), after seeing the victory 5–3 of class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, leading to 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all members of the team that it's not finished.
I'll go right tomorrow.
Behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold, behold,
All this is done only when the points are on the display table.
..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no ..no
"I'm always saying that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're totally clear about what's against us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Bjorn continued to say: “I wouldn’t give up that.
I'll be another kalibre tomorrow.
Madagascar ́sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
It's great to work with a partner, if things run well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested to limits of skills as a golfer.
"That's got to make the players clear: make the best out of you tomorrow.
"Now you're leaving your partner behind you, and you're going to take out the best of yourself."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be aware of that his players are better cut individually than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those great turnovers last day. He was standing in Brookline on the side of the winners before he was standing in the side of the losers to Europe's Wonder of Medinah.
"I remember every word fucked," responded a question how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 games important tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw it in Brookline and Medinah.
When the moment hits in a direction, it puts the median game under a lot of pressure.
"We'll make our team according to our team and send our boys out as we feel, you know we're trying to make magic tomorrow."
Thomas was awarded the task to take the object, he must play in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in top half of the ranking list.
"I've chosen for the boys in this order because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn says over his choice for individual meetings.
Germany’s new warship retraced
The newest fregatte of the German Navy would have been in service already in 2014 in order to replace the warships coming in the years from the era of the War Cold. However, it is delivered by local media due to defect systems and rapidly growing costes only early next year.
Initialization of "Rheinland-Pfalz", a vessel of brand new fragests of the Baden-Württemberg Class, was now transferred to the first half of 2019, according to the time of calling to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been launched in 2014, yet the ambitioso project was planned for troubled problems after delivery.
The four vessels of Baden-Württemberg-Classe (Baden-Württemberg-Classe) already ordered by Navy in 2007 shall replace the old fregates of Bremen-Classe.
They must include a powerful canon, a series of aeroplane defensive missiles, aeroplane targets, as well as tarn technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.

However, the persistent delays can result in that the modern vessels of guerra, destined to represente Germany as a marine force, are already deceased at the time of their operation.
Fregatte F125, who was persecuted by the accident, went to the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it by the Werft Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marines returned a boat after sending it.
It was little known about the reasons for returning it, but German media called a series of important "software and hardware errors" that would have made the new ship useless in a fighting situation.
Problems of software are particularly severe, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are used by a crew of 120 marines only, just about half as much as on the old fregattens of the Bremen class.
It is also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to invasion of performance, and prevents maritime operations in the future.
The 7000 tons heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" seemed to be twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defect hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training of the crew, also became a problem.
Costs apparently ascended to incredible € 3,1 billion, compared to € 2,2 billion initially planned.
Problems with the latest fregates are particularly important, in the light of the latest warnings that the Marine Force of Germany is shaking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, deputy advocat of German Bundestages, confirmed at the beginning of the year that the navy "issuedable ships".
Bartells said that the problem was bigger, because the old ships were taken away, but the ships of replacement were not allowed.
"Han lamentar, "no one of Baden-Württemberg-klases fregates can't be removed from the Marine.
National Trust Launch the Secret Life of the Fleeder Mouse
In a estate in the Scottish Highlands, there will be new researches that will show how the mouse use the landscape when searching for food.
Hopefully, the results will allow for further insights into the behavior of these unique sugars flying and helping to lead future activities involving conservation of nature.
The study conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland will detecte mouse for squirrels and mushrooms, as well as brown Langohr and water mouse for water in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed on key positions on the ground for recording the activities of mouse floating throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile tests with portable detectors.
In the analysis of all recordings, the frequencies of flirt rush will determine and determine what species produces.
Un map and report of the habitat will then be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior on the level of landscape.
Rob Dewar, consultant for Nature Protection for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of living area are the most important for flour mouse and how these are used by every species.
These data will help to determine the benefits of measures for managing habitat, such as crafting grains, and to show how to obtain forest areas for mushrooms and other related species.
In Scotland and the whole United Kingdom the stocks of floods in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and result in loss of living space.
Windwheels and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as flyers and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by cats.
“Fre und und sind sind sind sind.
"But their ears are better than their eyes, when they go captive, because of their habits of hunting night and night.

NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares land in Scotland, takes the subject of floder mouse very seriously.
He has 10 trained expertes, who regularly conducte investigations, inspections of sleepplaces and occasionally rescue measures.
The organization even has established Scotland's first and only reserve of flour mouse in Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 species of flour mouse.
Good manager David Thompson explains that real estate is the ideal living space for them.
"In Threave, we have a great area for meat mice," he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
"Pero, there are many things we still don't know about the mouse, therefore, here and other goods we use these work that help us to learn more about what the mouse needs to feel good."

Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
"Not we need to learn much about myoxins of flour and in many species of our species, we don't know how it stands for their populations."

Brexit: UK would ‘peace forever’ the loss of car manufacturers
"United Kingdom would "because it would "because, after Brexit, it would lose its status as a leading manufacturer of autos globally", according to Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
"It's a worrying thing," he continued, "that Toyota UK told BBC that it would suspende temporarily production in Burnaston's factory at Derby, Britain should leave EU.
“We need a deal,” says Clark.
The japanese automaker said that the influence of delays at the border in a non-deal Brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
Labour in Burnaston, where Toyota’s productlines Auris and Avensis producer, producer labour in Burnaston, labour in almost 150.000 vehicles last year, 90 % of which exported to rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience a stop production in our factory at a Brexit uncontrolled end March,” says Marvin Cooke, CEO de Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made anxiety about hard-out of the EU without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, por ejemplo, says that it will close its mini-work in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns are based on the automakers with risks within the supply chain in a hard Brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing facility will be operated on a just-in-time basis. This means that the parts will be delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers both from the UK and from the EU to prepare the cars on order.
If UK abandoned EU on 29 March without agreement, it could have come to limits of interruption, which, according to industry, could lead to delays and delays in partiality.
"It is impossible for Toyota to carry out a stock stock in Derbyshire factory, which amounted to longer than a day," the company said, "for this reason the production should be stopped.
"Treesa Mays Chequers plan for future relations with EU" "has "defined just to avoid such controls at borders".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal, which, like I said before, enabled us to enjoy not only the current success, but also this opportunity,” he said in the broadcast Today of BBC Radio 4.
“Las datas de Toyota, not only, but also of other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue the supply chain very successful so far.”
Toyota couldn't indicate how long the production should be suspended, but in the long term warned that additional cost would reduce competitiveness of the factory and ultimately would result in loss of workplace.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is a senior official of the Unite Association of Works, declares that his members are increasingly anxious: “I'm going to know that these jobs never return once they're gone again.

Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could move again according to reports of White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Vice-Ministry of Justice Rod Rosenstein could “move to another week” while the dispute about candidates to Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, according to a statement from White House Sunday.

The question of whether Trump would fire Vice-Minister of Justice and this would risk Mueller’s independence, was the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
The New York Times reported in the beginning of the month that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secret recording his conversations with Trump, as well as the cancellation of the president using the 25th constitutional addition.
Rosenstein demented the report.
Late Monday, however, he went to White House, while new reports were reported about his presumptuous resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was present at that time at UN General Assembly in New York, was notified for next Thursday,
Trump stated that he preferred not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was transferred to avoid conflicting with the consultation of the United States Senate Justicial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who protested abuse sexual against him, said Kavanaugh and Dr.
Trump ordered on Friday a weekly FBI investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of Senate.
Trump’s press speaker Sarah Sanders appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
"With the question of meeting with Rosenstein, she responded: "Une date has not been fixed yet. It might be this week, but I still can imagine that it will be transferred for another week, in view of all the things that just go before the Supreme Court.
I'll show it, but I always like to keep press on running."
Some reporters would think they would oppose this argument: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace interrogeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sanders said that the low frequencies of press conferences weren’t denied “efectuousness” of the TV reporter, but said: “But I wouldn’t refute that they were denied effectuousness.”
He argued then that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"President made more question and response rounds than every president before him," she explained, without giving accurate evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
"Sanders insiste, "si la presse la ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying real estate in UK
Inverters from abroad will need to impose a higher tax taxes for the purchase of real estate in United Kingdom in the future. Additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step will end up the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
Aumentation of stamp tax will affect all those who don't pay tax in the United Kingdom

Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when you buy real estate in United Kingdom, while the majority of incomes will benefit uncovered.
This step represents a tentative of Jeremy Corbyn's success in young voters, promising to provide more affordable living space and to take a look at top worthwhiles.

The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson pronunciated a reduction of the tax of stamps to allow more young people to have their first home home.
He accused the construction firms of maintaining the price of real estate by purchasing land without using it, and insisted in Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments in order to end the "residency spate" of Britain.

I got it on the bank and that was’s,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s SportsSound broadcasting.
“Mas, as a child, often saw playing with my father in Hampden in Scotland, and that’s something that always draws me back.
I wouldn't be able to do this if I would be successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's ex-chef adjudicated no fear of going into the footsteps of that established name in such a club, after he rejected offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
I'll be able to bring the League back to Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this association, he is without doubt part of the Premier League,” he said.
"Non es fácil conseguirlo ahí, pero i'll considere mi tiempo ahí como un éxito, si i'll bringe ahí ahí."
Ross can demonstrate only a three-year career management, after a phase as vice-chef at Dumbarton, and a 15-month activity as coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third liga, and half St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the next season.
Ross says that he now feels better than ever in his gamer career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That's probably a real way of divorce," he remembers when he assumed responsibility from Alloa.
“I really think that management was the right for me, more than playing.
It sounds ridiculous, because I didn't work mal, was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
Pero play can be hard.
There are many things you need to do every week.
I still do this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I've done it. I've never felt so good in my skin like adults all my life."

Hundreds of migrant children were silent and silently brought to a tent city on the border of Texan
The number of infants migratory internals is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively equal, including, as rigorous rhetoric and actions of Trump’s government made it difficult to submit children to nurses.
Tradicionalmente, majoritarian immigrants themselves were illegal immigrants and now feared to become even a target for expulsion when they signate to take a child.
Risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potentielle guardians and other adult members of their household should give their fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Authority Imigration and Customs Enforcement, stated before Congress that the Authority arrested dozens of people who protested for the care of minors non-company.
Later, Autoritas confirmed, 70 % of the arrested had no pre-inscriptions in the criminal register.
“80% of the people who are self-career or a member of a household of a career are illegal in the country, and major part of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we'll continue to follow these people," Albence said.
In order to process the case of the children, officials have implemented new rules that, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, require within a month of 60 days after detension, appear before the tribunal, a priori standard.
Many of them appear via video streaming and not personally to enter before a judge of immigration for their status legal.
When negative decisions, the person is rapidly deported.
The longer these children remain in custody, the less likely it is, according to reports of the host staff, as well as reports from the system that were notified in the last month that they are terrified and deprimed, which can result in violente eruptions, explosions, etc.
Defendants say that these concerns are enhanced in a larger facility like Tornillo, since there are signs that a child has problems, which are easier to ignore due to the size of a child.
They also explained that traumas, at which many children already suffer, can intensify if they are brought in a city of tent without emotional preparation, or in sufficiency time to say good to friends.

Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to handle them, a few talked about them with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the study of Nationwide reported to talk to your spouses about the cost of long-term care.
It was only 10% to talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s Life Insurance Department.
You should start with this.
Talk with your partner and children: They can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you’re not expressing your desires in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining cost.
Bring your Financial Advisor aboard: Your Financial Advisor can also help you find a way of financing these spending.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional health insurance, a hybrid capital-generating life insurance, to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the grave while FBI begins to investigate
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked, that's a timely and limited investigation, then we might be able to get a little attention," - he said Flake on Saturday.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate FBI?
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2>
Sep. 6 November, elections interims are just five weeks away. Sep. 6 November, if Republicans separate badly, they would be debilitated in their attempts to choose their husband to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What's going on after FBI presents report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which currently 51 Republicans and 49 demokrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh could unite at least 50 votes in Senat, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to decide equal votes, and confirme it in front of Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean translators ‘sinkt’ under Kim
The number of North Korean migrants to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from South Korean Ministry of Reconciliation, claimed that 1127 immigrants were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices for human traffickers than major factors.
But Pjöngjang was not publicly speaking.
In the end, majority of the fugitives from North will be offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
"Majoritarians fly over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two states of Korea.
China considers overthrowers more as illegal immigrants than as refugees and often brings them back with violence.
"Relations between North and South, which are technically still in the state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Initial month, the two heads of state in Pyongyang met to talk about the negotiations of denuclearization initiated.
This was due to the historical meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Not being able to trust the United States, we do not have confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to desarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech before UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi nomina Brett Kavanaugh "hysterial"
Nancy Pelosi, deputy minority leader of the House of Representatives, nominated Judge candidates Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and said that he was particularly inappropriate for Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't reject the impression that a woman who would have acted as 'hysterial' would have been called 'hysterial'," Pelosi said in a comment of Kavanaugh in a statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented emotively all accusations that he abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually, when both teens were.
Kavanaugh was very emotional during his opening speech, and sometimes he cried fast and standing shortly in tears when he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also expressly condemned the democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated reputation murder" organized by Liberals by liberals, furious over Hillary Clinton's lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that they believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he couldn't serve the Supreme Court, because she showed that he was arrested against democrats.
“I think he has expressed himself invariably with these statements and the way he has expressed himself over Clintons and the Democrats,” he added.
Pelosi protesta, se la interrogea, se la interrogeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
"I'll say so much: if he doesn't say the truth to Congress or FBI, then he's not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current jurist posts", - he's said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge of the Bundesberufungsgericht in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added, "Kavanaughs, as democrat, concerns possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion primary decision Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge."
Kavanaugh interrogeaeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with them because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, deputata de Congress de Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidency candidatures.
In 1987, when Hart was captured on board of a ship called Monkey Business in a foreign business and then returned his candidature, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of presidentship candidature.
"Not was a good idea decision," she said 30 years later, laughing.
Seven candidates were already in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
“Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Since the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind the funding and she swear not to candidate if she shouldn't get $2 million together.
It was an unprecedented battle.
She found that some of her supporters who donated 1000 dollars to men supported their campaign only with 250 dollars.

In the speech, in which she announced that she would not start a campaign official, she was so grateful for her emotions, grateful for her supporters, frustration over the system, which made the media debuting and direct addressing voters instead of delegates so difficult, as well as anger over sexism, so exaggerated that she was close to the tears.
“Oh, man ought to think I've suffered a nervous breakthrough,” memories Schroeder of the press reactions.
“You could have believed that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I'll remember me, I'll ask myself what they think would write on my grave stone.

Why Beijing could benefit from War Trade between USA and China
The opening salmons of the trade war between the USA and China were desperate. Although the battle still not finished, Beijing could benefit from a tomb between the countries in the long term, according to my experts.
Donald Trump, President of America, fired the first warning committee begins of the year, when he invested important export goods Chinese, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penal customs.
The major escalation took place this week with new penal taxes on goods worth $ 200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to USA.
Peking rushed the same way every time and recently invoked penal charges from 5-10% to US goods worth $ 60 billion.
China swore to respond to every action of the United States and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon fall.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, my expertes that, when Beijing plays well his cards, China could benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term, reducing mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision policy in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have recognized before,” says Abigail Grace, co-worker of science, who focused at the Center for New American Security in Asia.
