Members of the Assembly of Wales are worried about “passing for marionnets”
Gallois elections are consterned by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Gallois Parliament).
This proposal comes from the draft amendment to the name of the Assembly, which would become the Gallois Parliament.
In the political sphere, Members of the Assembly believe that this could be subject to roots.
An elected worker said his group was concerned about the fact that the seal was “linked with Twp and Pwp.”
For non-indigenous readers from Wales: in Gallois, twp means stupid, and pwp means crude.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Part of Wales) is not “satisfied” and has offered other formulas.
The conservative party would be “open” to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet (maryonnette), the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Gallois, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, stated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly returns to the latter".
The 2007 Government of Wales Act (Government of Wales Act of 2017) grants the Galles Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as the Galloan Parliament, which was also widely supported.
On the issue of the title of the Members, the Commission refers to Members of the Gallois Parliament (or WMP), but a vast majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that Members of the Assembly make other suggestions, but the effort to reach a consensus could be a real headline for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft law on name change in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other amendments to the functioning of the Assembly, including the rules for the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of the country's name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country will now be called the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in a attempt to resolve a decades-old container between the country and its Greek neighbour, for which Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens insists on the fact that the name of Macedonia is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on the accession of its neighbouring country to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, said he would not take into account the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: Churches in difficulty, St. Martin's clocks reduced to silence
“The elderly people with whom I have discussed say that traditionally there was a bar and a church in every corner of the street,” Adams says.
“There’s no longer any more today.”
According to him, it is normal that the bars are rare.
Today, “we are no longer frequent in the same way,” he explains.
“Before we went to the bar like his neighbor’s house, but that’s no longer the case.”
With regard to churches, the funds from the sale of buildings will be exhausted long before the managers imagined, and this concerns him: “so soon or later, they will return to the departure house.”
It adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuary of the neighborhood.
“People who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely Whites who will hurry to close the entire church, because it is unlikely that they will become members,” he said.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white churches built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin 10 years later.
The original White Methodist congregation abandoned the places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, who preached around, took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was restored by a black community under the direction of Revelation John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the main streets in Harlem, in which the Blacks were trying to use or get a promotion.
In 1939, a fire broke down the building, but the Parosians of Father Johnson were ready to rebuild and ordered a new carriage.
that Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "clothes of the poor."
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), a professional who played in July, assigned him a completely different name: “a cultural treasure” and “a unsubstitutable historical instrument.”
It also mentions that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin has not replaced it.
In the last few months, there has been a lot of question about the remodeling of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the laic elite of the church on the one hand, and the bishop's diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, a management body composed of laic officials, informed the diocese that he was worried that the latter wanted to impose the expenses incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians regretted the lack of transparency from the diocese.
California: 13-year-old teenager injured by a rabbit during a fishing part in the homer
According to the authorities, a rabbit attacked and injured a 13-year-old young man last Saturday while practicing homard fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, San Diego's television channel, that he was floating with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying out with help and began paying to him to get him out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out of joy for having taken a trap, and then he realized that in reality he was
had been morbid.
When he arrived near the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the keyboard.
“I shouted so that everyone went out of the water: there’s a cake!” said Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Rady Children Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of the rabbit originating in the attack is not known.
At a press conference, Vice-President Larry Giles reported that a rabbit had been seen a few weeks earlier, but that it wasn't a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered from traumatic injuries on the upper part of the throat.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach to Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of chickens, but most are considered non-dangerous.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetics market
Sainsbury's makes a low hand on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and the strains of supermarkets, full of aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by specialists in the field.
As part of a major pervasion in the UK aesthetic market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sales of fashion and home items are falling, broader beauty products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience proves to be conclusive.
The supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse space previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would increase the volume of its offers to up to 3,000 cosmetics, which will include brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in sectors similar to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also restores its Shop makeup line to offer a majority of animal-free products, increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, fragrance Shop's perfume seller will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening in Selly Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders must crash their head to attract consumers, who tend to make their online shopping and go to nearby stores for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the sales points will look more and more like the larger surfaces, as the supermarket chain attempts to counter the discount shops Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores, since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed to drive sales of current consumer goods and profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempts to restructure pharmaceutical and cosmetic items in the UK chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury’s attempted to partner with Boots, but he ended up following a controversy about the distribution of profits from pharmacies implanted in supermarkets.
After selling its 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for a total of 125 million pounds to Celesio, the owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds, the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role that consisted of introducing a wide range of high-quality brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, announced that the appearance of beauty products rays has been modified to improve the customer’s framework.
“We have also invested in training so that our staff can provide informed advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all kinds of needs and, thanks to the emblem of our rays and the ideal situation of our establishments, our cosmetics market dominance is now unquestionable and changes purchasing habits,” said Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones's friend after Holly Willoughby’s withdrawal from a £11 million deal
Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after announcement of the withdrawal of animator Holly Willoughby from a £11 million contract linked to her home decor brand, to dedicate her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to take care of the Truly interior decoration brand and accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old animator of This Morning announced on Instagram she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, angry, leaving their successful textile and interior decoration activity in the last minute to dedicate to its new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry when the dear child of the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under tension at the headquarters of the Dragon's Den Commercial Empire star in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million sterling pounds, would no longer allow him to take care of Truly's interior and their decorative brand.
The Truly brand was similar to the one of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram she left Truly, Jones jumped into her private jet to join one of her secondary residences outside the UK.
According to a source, “Truly was far from one of Hollywood’s priorities.
and to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow’s seat is full of products ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning animator, which is one of Britain’s most “bankable” celebrities, could lose millions of companies due to significant investments in products ranging from curtains or bowls, clothing or interior items, and the risk that a late launch is expected.
In addition, this could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
The couples went on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the shares in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as the animator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones said last night he didn’t want to comment on his business.
The debate was hollow, but finally we love one another.
Trump laughed at the media that criticized him due to his comments that some consider “a president indignation,” and to show himself so positive towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump give it so much?"
It was a TV journalist’s voice.
“I haven’t done anything at all.”
He said Kim Jong-un had shown himself favourable to hold a second meeting, after Trump qualified the first, which took place in Singapore in June, a large step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Nevertheless, negotiations on this denuclearization are dead.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomatic head Ri Yong Ho told global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that they did not see any “corresponding response” from the United States to the first North Korean disarmament measures.
He regrets that, on the contrary, the United States continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his meeting speech, Trump offers a much more optimistic perspective.
“It’s all right with North Korea,” the President of the United States said.
We've deceived the armed conflict.
“Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve Kim’s relations have resulted in positive results: the end of missile shooting attempts, the release of refugees and the remains of North American military returned to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to play the role of president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full-cracking area, there’s just over 200 standing in front of me,” he said.
Tsunami: a deserted island and hundreds of people died in Indonesia
After the earthquake that landed in Lombok, the aid of foreign NGOs was presumably not necessary.
More than 10 percent of the population of Lombok have been dispersed, but no national disaster state has been declared, a condition required for the launch of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have many times clearly stated that they did not want international aid, which makes things a bit complicated,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is set up a team to go to Palu, she still doesn’t know if work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the trembling that he constantly suffers, the country cruelly lacks resources to protect itself from the caprices of nature.
Refugees have been arranged in Aceh, but they rarely occur in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been reported, no warning sirene has noticed Palu, which has probably contributed to human losses.
Even in ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to the other is not easy.
Natural disasters make use of transport more complicated.
A hospital ship that was posted in Lombok to cure the victims is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least 3 days to reach the locations of the new disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has put the reform of the infrastructure in the centre of his electoral campaign and has spent considerable amounts to rebuild railroads and railroads.
However, the lack of funds declined the government of Mr. Joko, which was called to be represented in front of the electorate next year.
The Indonesian state leader also suffers pressures related to the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority exercise their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been kidnapped from their homes, on the grounds of confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, armed with mascots, arches and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
The Liverpool attacker Daniel Sturridge achieves equality against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saves a defeat in Liverpool in Premier League against Chelsea, marking at the 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goals, and his team was conducted from 1 to 0.
He shot in the ball on his left, before he escaped a shot to the second poultry.
The balloon flys above the repair surface before moving towards the upper right corner of the grid.
The ball ends by reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends his way to the bottom of the cage.
“I was just trying to place myself on the ball, but players like Shaq always pull out as far as possible, so I tried to make the most of time,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thinking I decided to shoot.”
Chelsea took 1 to 0 in the middle after a Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues attacker took a passport towards Mateo Kovacic, before moving towards the middle of the ground and sprinter side of Liverpool.
Kovacic realized a quick walk-and-departure in the middle of the field,
Then he performed a beautiful deep shooting that brought Hazard into the surface.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended his race in the net of the second poultry, with a left foot shooting behind Liverpool's gateway, Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitans in the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Stadium San Paolo de Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia: the number of victims of tsunami rises to 832
Disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami balance reported 832 deaths.
Many people are trapped under the collapse of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-sized earthquake that dropped the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 meters high, the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was devastated by collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old suspected of kidnapping a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Merseyside) this morning.
At 07:55, the 44-year-old woman was discovered in the street John de Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the residents of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
Police captain Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation just started, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard anything suspect to contact us.
I call on taxi drivers, who could have captured something about their dashcam and ask them to provide us with any critical information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a property in Birkenhead where she lived.
This morning, people who claim to know the woman presented themselves in the place of the crime and asked questions about where she was discovered.
The investigation is underway and the police reported that she informed parents close to the victim.
A taxi driver just denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police did not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him without a voice.
The residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer confessed that the whole sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the places,
He said, “It’s too horrible.”
At 14:00, two police carriages were placed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several agents watched the building on the inside side of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the failure agency at 0800 555 111, according to the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: Cromwell’s statue, last victim of a attempt to rewrite history
Its prohibition would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural goods of England, committed by its Puritan supporters, such as fanatic Taliban.
However, Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick’s proposal “unreasonable” and called it a “revisionist attempt”.
The President of Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said, “Because of the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that the one of Oliver Cromwell erected before the Westminster Palace would not be saved.
Cromwell did not order or conduct the iconoclaim during the English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions committed by his ancestor Thomas during the previous century.
The superb representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, proves the consideration we had for him in the nineteenth century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate.
Mr. Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, I mean, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is precise or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that collapsed in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognized figure that represents a side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be emphasized and commemorated.”
China: A pig kills a farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in Southeast China.
Identified as M, Yuan, the man was found dead, cut and covered with blood arthritis near a porchery on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, said the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pork farmer prepares to inject pork vaccines in a pork on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had traveled with his cousin since the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday in order to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighbouring porch was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood flowed from his mouth.
A medical-legal report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg mutiled the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, M. Wu, the breeder's cousin, said "His legs were brown and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arrives on the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig originated from Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market officer told Evening News that the animal was closed to avoid any other incident and allowed police to collect evidence.
The farmer's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although facts are rare, pig attacks on people have already been reported.
In 2016 in a farm in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig hit a gallous elephant on his tractor before his wife managed to remove it.
In 2012, while an Oregon farmer had just been eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer claimed to CBC News that it wasn’t in principle an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood could cause this kind of behavior.
“These are rather players,
Very curious boys... they have no intention of hurting.
Just show them respect for them,” he says.
The remains of the Rosa Hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the southeast of the United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will lead to assaults in the northeast of Mexico and southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Winds flooded at 135 km/h (range 1 hurricane) from 5 a.m. in the morning, east Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Hurricane should move to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circulates to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Lower California on Monday in the form of storm, the Rosa hurricane will lead to intense tropical humidity to the northeast of the United States.
It will fall up to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity combined with nearby depression will create widespread torrential rain in the southwest over the next few days.
At local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden dangerous raw raw materials, debris and potential land displacements in the desert.
The averses will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per location, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the southwest, particularly large part of Arizona.
Tropical rain spreads risk sudden floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is highly uncommon to adventure in the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical precipitation.
Intensive rains could turn the canyons into chained rivers, and storms will produce wind rails and dust torches by location.
Nearby depression will lead to abundance of local rain in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The rainometric totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could cause low flows of debris and make the chassis glitter.
It could be the first rain in the region’s dry season.
Disperged tropical averses will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, and will intensify later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitation will take place at the four corners of the country on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
Important temperature variations are to be predicted for October through the United States due to the refreshing of the Arctic, but the climate of the tropicals will remain warm,
This sometimes causes a radical change in time on short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will surpass considerable temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example of this.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the center and east of the United States should know a warm beginning of October, with temperatures rotating around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other northeast regions.
The mercure could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, approximately 10 degrees above the average season.
Several days forecasts indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television channels on Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh, candidate to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexual assault in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the political impasse continued, broadcasting services stopped their usual Friday program to announce a theatre strike: an agreement imagined by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Christine Ford assured 100% that Kavanaugh, under the effect of alcohol, had supplied abuse on her person and tried to remove her clothes during a high school evening.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate shooting, also claimed to be 100% sure that this had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial has probably reached a hearing of more than 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial attracted the world as much as a football match or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators widely supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, was the most watched channel on the hearing day, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC took second place with a audience reaching 3.26 million.
Following CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), still according to Nielsen.
The interest was not done once the audition was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that played on Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras unveiled a scene in which the senator was partly taken by demonstrators while trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowered the eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmitted the live intervention sequence.
“Don’t look elsewhere, look at me,” one of the women said.
“Do you really believe he says the truth?
You have power while so many women are deprived.”
Before the elevator's doors were closed, Flake stated that his office had published a statement and that he would say more about it during the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast network channels would cover the live session a few hours later, while the judicial committee was preparing to vote the procedure to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh by the whole Senate.
Flake said, however, that a weekly investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on the accusations against the candidate, which were claiming minority Democrats.
Flake has been partly convinced by discussing with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He took his decision after interviewing Coons and several other senators later.
His choice was heavy in the balance, as the Republicans wouldn’t have actually obtained votes to approve Kavanaugh’s appointment without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh’s sexual assault charges.
UK: May accuses opponents of Brexit of making "small policy"
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project to leave the European Union, to make “small policy” on the basis of the future of Britain and national interest.
May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another exchange with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attacks on his so-called Chequers plans, affirming that the proposal for free trade between the UK and the European Union was "smallly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the origin of the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect of fatal shooting that caused the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, has also been kidnapped and is charged with a second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police officer said.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims had lost their glasses during the altercation.
Found on the crime scenes, the glasses carried Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a CBS group subsidiary.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed the police to be responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his insurance was fixed at $350,000.
The lawyer's office of the Baton-Red parish published a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a injury by a ball that crossed the head and settled in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the legal medical laboratory of the state police, the Southern University police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s sports director Joe Alleva thanked the order forces for their “engagement and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rebonds per match during the last season.
Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said the team was “devastated and shocked” after the news of Wayde’s death.
“We are afraid of this kind of event all the time,” Wade regretted.
Mexico: a crash volcano of ashes
The cedar escaped the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention recommended that the Mexicans get away from the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 emissions of gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center monitored several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, images showed fine layer of cedar covering car glasses in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians observed an increase in volcano activity at 72 km from the capital since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 seized the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Affronts between police and separatists approaching the anniversary of the vote for independence
Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after confrontations between independentist protesters and anti-emmy police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being refouled by anti-small police, masked separatists threw them eggs and colored dust, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not disrupt tourists.
Heatings also climbed later in the day, while police used mattresses to contain confrontations.
For several hours, independence groups that scanned “never forgotten nor forgotten” faced Unionist supporters shouting “long life in Spain”.
14 demonstrators with mild injuries were healed, according to the local press.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by the Catalans favoring separation, tensions remain alive in the independent region.
A devastating majority of voters chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opponents of the secession who largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing voting offices in the region.
Independent groups camped on Friday night to block a national police support demonstration.
It was the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hope for the independence of Catalonia.
“We were witnesses last year of a great moment.
My parents were crying for joy in the idea of being able to vote, but now we are in a disaster,” he said.
Despite their capital victory, although thin, in the regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties had difficulty maintaining the eagle this year, many popular leaders being exiled or detained while waiting for being judged for organizing the referendum and declared independence of Catalonia.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic, who films the police support demonstration on her phone, judges politicians responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand and on the other.
“The tension only makes up,” he regretted.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan prison leaders in wait for a judgment since last year, announced his intention to present his candidate for the European Parliament election next year.
“This is the best way for me to convict the regression of democratic values and the repression chained by the Spanish government,” he added.

Livingston wins the match 1 to 0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga’s first goal ensures Livingston’s victory
Recently upgraded, Livingston's team surprised Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 matches to Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox club.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to be ranked in second place, equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard’s men are deprived of victory outside Premiership this season, and must face the Hearts team on Sunday, which leads 8 points.
But before, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the Europa League Thursday.
As for the Livingston team, she extends her 6 matches invaded in the division, and her main coach Holt, who has replaced Kenny Miller since last month, may be deemed to have not yet lost the least match.
Livingston missed an opportunity in front of excited opponents
Holt's team could have taken a lot of progress before marking, as their direct approach was putting the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to pierce but remained tied in front of the adverse goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team let the Rangers possess the ball, knowing that it could disturb them through working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal came.
The Rangers took a frank hit and the Livingston tried an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson were allied to capture Menga, who took a touch and enrolled a goal in the middle of the field.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the game, but they faced an imminent defense and the goal guard Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half-time experienced the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's arrest.
Rangers guard Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's hit, while Lithgow managed to make one of Livingston's plans.
The Livingston Guard recalled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalty were rejected by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halkett directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a hand fault.
The “Fenomenal” of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from the BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to overcome the expectations of this uplifting pen.
Their style and composition of the team have almost not changed since their return to the summit, but the merit is largely returned to Holt for having motivated a team since its arrival.
which counts on many great players.
The defence of Captain Halkett was great and beautifully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the hallway throughout the match.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level reached with Gerrard, they have not been at the height of their past talent.
They missed the last opportunity and managed to perceive the adverse side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the painting.
President Erdogan's welcome to Cologne
Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, press freedom or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne in order to open one of the greatest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering in front of the building, while many supporters were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, have heard their voice, condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome them in their country.
The climbing of protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed as heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocratic by others.
Road accident to Deptford: a cyclist dies due to a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 local time, near the connection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent road from Deptford southeast of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescue arrived on site, but the man died at the location of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said the officers were doing their best to identify the individual and prevent his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been put in place. It is advisable for drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 agents injured in an issue
The high-security prison officer said six prisoners had been injured during an issue.
The issue began at the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 9:30 a.m. local Sunday. It is still not under control.
Specialized anti-emmy agents were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detained and contained in a prison ring.
On site, agents have been treated for mild injuries to the face.
A spokeswoman of the jail management said: “The staff specially trained was deployed to restore order in the HMP Long Lartin jail.
Six agents were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible must respond to the police authorities and be able to see their prolonged penalties.”
More than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country, have been imprisoned in HM Long Lartin.
In June, the director of the prison was hospitalized after an aggression by a prisoner.
In October, last year, anti-emmy agents were sent to prison to raise a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked personnel with billard balls.
Ouragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden raw materials (which could be beneficial for drying areas)
It is rare that tropical depression touches Arizona, but this is probably what will happen at the beginning of next week. The Rosa hurricane is heading toward the southwest desert with what is left of energy. This region could be affected by crude.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, with rainfall from Monday evening.
The Phoenix-based national weather service said in a tweet that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the tropical depression or storm stadium in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was arrested 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center provide 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm per location in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the southwest desert including the central area of Rocheuses and the Grand Bassin should record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measurements up to 10 cm.
Rosa rain may be savings for areas affected by drying that are not exposed to the risks of sudden raw.
Although the risk of flood should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwest region, given the current dryness situation.
According to the U.S. Dryness Monitoring System, a little more than 40% of Arizona knows at least one extreme dryness, the second most serious category,” weather.com reports.
The Rosa Hurricane begins its journey on the coast, on the peninsula of Basse-California.
Always with a high power Sunday morning and generating winds up to 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitations could be massive and lead to a risk of floods.
“In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitation is expected from Lower California northwest of Sonora and will be able to reach up to 25 cm,” weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico north, with the force of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona on Tuesday early in the morning, as a tropical depression. It will cross Arizona and South of Utah on Tuesday evening.
“Torrent rain is expected in Lower California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and is the main danger,” the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that these precipitations will lead to potentially deadly crude crude and debris in the arid regions, as well as land climbs in the mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested in charge of a murder attempt, after a 16-year-old boy was found kidnapped in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4 p.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital and his condition is currently stable.
Avon and Sommerset police reported arresting the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) at the night of Radstock.
Agents have launched a call to people who are likely to have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been victim of the evil and anger of Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the undeniable and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a Wheeling meeting in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been a victim of the evil and anger of Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations, who accused her of having sexually assaulted her several decades ago, when they were teens.
Ford also witnessed at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s intelligence and courage.”
“A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in public service,” he explained to the crowd of supporters gathered in Western Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he pointed out the importance of Republican participation in the mid-mandate elections.
“We are at five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats were in a mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
The first decision-making vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, according to a statement by a Republican party collaborator at CNN.
Indonesia: An earthquake and tsunami make hundreds of victims, the balance stops
On Saturday, the authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of which were carried by huge waves that were shot on the beaches while a tsunami followed by earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Célebs.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in Palu, when six-meter high waves submerged the beach at the fall of the night. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their pass.
The earthquake, of a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not escape immediately, it cost them their lives,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone. He trained cars, pieces of wood, housing, he took everything with him,” Nugroho explained, stating that the tsunami had moved offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hit the coast.
Some people could save their lives by climbing on the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 Palu centres.
The air pictures published by the catastrophe management agency show devastated buildings and stores, deformed and screwed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
The replies continued to dry the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which is on the edge of a long narrow bay, would have been able to enlarge the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is significant; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodys were found trapped under the collapses of ruined buildings, he added, stating that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said human and material losses could be more important on the 300 km coast north of Palu, a region called Donggala, the closest to the earthquake epicenter.
Communications were “fully paralyzed” since Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were moving to the affected areas.
“The situation is dramatic and could get worse,” she added.
Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disclosing the information a tsunami had touched Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was published.
A shared amateur video on social media shows a man on the floor of a building shouting franticly to the passagers in the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall fell on the coast, bringing with him buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general electricity failure that cut all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to drive aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people always have great need of food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport has been reopened as part of emergency operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had to visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia: the balance of the victims of the tsunami has increased, accounting for more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision in Donggala have arrived in Palu, where they found refuge in the caves located at the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered scenes of destruction, says Doseba.
“They told me that many houses were destroyed,” he said.
It's a tragedy.
When the aid groups began to rescue the disasters, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not been entitled to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, funds and foreign personnel may enter the territory only if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
“This disaster is always considered regional,” explains Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and Friday’s tsunami fell on Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the wheels.
Sunday, rescue officers have released a woman who has been injured under the decay for two days, near her mother’s body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paraply team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students found themselves caught at the Roa Roa hotel, added Mandagi.
“As a former in the discipline of the parapent, I have experienced my own dramas,” he explains.
In the hours following the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of the parapent, Mr. Gendon told him that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes attending the beach festival in Palu.
His messages were left without answers.
“I don’t think they’ve ever received my messages.”
At Newport on the Levee, thieves substitute $26,750 when reloading an automatic distributor
Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 to a Brink's agent who recharged an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police service.
The driver of the vehicle saw a distributor in the entertainment complex and was preparing to feed it, Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind Brink's employee and stole a money bag for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leaving the places, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity is asked to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The rapper Kanye West is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Anciently known as Kanye West.”
Aged 41, West, who has been called Ye for some time, has used this surname as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The rapper made this change just before going to Saturday Night Live, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces Ariana Grande’s, who canceled her arrival for “emotional reasons”, explained the creator of the show.
In addition to being the abbreviation of its current professional pseudo, this surname also has a religious significance for West.
“I think “Ye” is the most used word in the Bible, where it means “you,” explained West earlier this year, mentioning the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m you.
I have passed from Kanye, which means "the only" to Ye - it reflects the good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.”
West is not the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West in the past, also played on the union traits and majors.
In Mexico, AMLO says he will never use military forces against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use the military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody repression of the order forces against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco’s place to “never use the military force to repress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, the troops opened the fire during a pacifist demonstration, killing 300 people at the time when the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly allocations to students and opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drive young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding, according to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after several U.S. government actors made announcements about the IA, while an official IA strategy is lacking in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in IA innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the funds for IA research in the field would be a good start because all other countries have an advance length on the United States, and we are looking for the next big discovery in IA,” Lee said.
Duplicating funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated the best ranked American Othello player and then integrated the Microsoft Reasearch management team and became president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition will take place to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government.
“It’s not China that suits the university leaders, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited major university names to work on the IA.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support US efforts in the field of IA.
“I think green cards should be automatically awarded to IA researchers,” he said.
The China State Affairs Council unveiled its new generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier in the year, the Department of Defense of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve partners in the industry and the academy. The White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million per year for research in the IA.
In parallel, the U.S. legislation working on establishing a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
Sunday, the Macedonians heard their voices in a referendum on the change of their country's name to the North Republic of Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked the request for Macedonia to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a law on its territory and opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote during the referendum and a boycott campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum 50% participation required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: “Do you want to join NATO and the EU under the conditions of the agreement signed with Greece?”
According to supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, it is the price to pay for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, rescued from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the rule of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, sufficient parliamentary members said they would follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change in the name would require a majority of two-thirds in the parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected at 13:00 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, while it had reached 34 percent at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilised 66 percent of voters registered after the election.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” estimates 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the change of name to open a vote to NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In the parliament, in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments; the unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
“I think a large majority will be favorable because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after posting his newsletter.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters would intend to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian Telma Chain, estimated participation at 57%.
70 percent of the participants who were planning to vote said they would vote "yes".
In order to be valid the referendum, 50% of the votes plus a vote are required.
The failure of the referendum would be the first tough hit on the policy of the pro-western government since its adoption of power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, frightened a way through Brighton’s defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the defenders of Brighton in Manchester and won the 2-0 match on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero’s goal at the 65th minute seemed to be the simplest action in the world for the player.
The Argentine buffer received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before blowing on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned a defender before avoiding the others just close to Brighton's goal.
Then he spent the ball at Sterling, on his left.
The English front took advantage of it to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton guard Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has some problems with his feet,” said Pep Guardiola, the team’s coach, to journalists.
“We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We had the luck that he had scored at that moment.”
But Sterling had given Skyblues the initial advantage during the Premier League match.
From the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on the ground of Brighton.
He sent him to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second poll.
The Skyblues' front sent the ball into the nets just before sliding out of the ground.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play rocky-featuring troubles
Since the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new match.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only in case of eliminatory match for the Rockies, true legends faced with the Los Angeles Dodgers of the West League division.
The Rockies won 5-2 in front of the Nationals Friday evening, but they are still trying to secure their first division title.
“Although this match doesn’t matter, we want to beat the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I’ll have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
Nationals have to announce a launcher on Sunday, but they will tend to leave the place at Scherzer in this situation.
Scherzer, for which it would be the 34th departure, will be in training on Thursday and will launch on its usual Sabbath day, Sunday.
The right of the Washington is 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 worth points on take-ups in 220 steps and two-thirds this season.
Trump’s Interventions in West Virginia
The President made a statement on the situation that he generated his support to Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, speaking of the importance of Republican participation in the mid-mandate elections.
“All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are at five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s a major issue. I’m not a candidate, but I’m more involved than ever. That’s why I’m fighting on all fronts for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible radical group, really horrible, Democrats, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
Democrats are in mission of “resistance and obstruction”.
“You can see it in the last four days,” he added, before calling the Democrats “angry, evil and liars.”
He discussed the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which was worthy of the public.
“Do you remember his answer?”
Did you disclose the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The working party is no longer the great community he was.
It is not tolerable for those who express their ideas.
When activists of the Momentum movement of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a line of parliamentarians of the Working Party considered to be not welcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated identically because she raised anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and ironically, these are the subjects for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting announcement said Friday: “We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive.”
That was exactly what the General Assembly of the Friday evening during my eight years as a parliamentary of the Working Party.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case of many meetings and the promise of more gentle and respectable policies has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is considered to be acceptable by the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought to share the same political vision began to wait for me to return my pants and to take positions on the opposite of my beliefs, whether it concerns national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I talked publicly, and no matter what I said, I followed an abusive shooting on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, saying I should not be a member of the party.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I have more chances than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were made to me were of political nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a deferrant of sexist or racist speeches every day, but who do not drop their arms.
One of the most disappointing things in current policy is the standardization of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this large community and that the party is limited to deficiency movements and changes to the selection rules.
I have been given a lot of advice in the last two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would go well.
But this is not what I do in politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolmaster, because the negligence of Thatcher’s government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I had to work for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local adviser or government minister.
I have never hid my political ambitions, even in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the current leaders of the party.
All I would like to say to those who defended the motion on Friday is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services. I think it's not really time to waste time and energy by debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my voters, whether they are worker or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will prevent me from acting for the reasons I defend, which are your interests to all.
Chris Leslie is parliamentary for the district of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr remains invasive
Two late trials may have falseed the final result, but no doubt: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense day match of Scotland’s rugby championship to XV.
The team now occupies the top ranking and becomes the only invasive team in the championship.
Finally, it is the superiority of their defense and how they are caught up with the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can welcome this match.
“We have been tested until now, but we remain invisible, so I have to be happy!” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Blessed to them, they were more effective than we and they knew to grasp opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's test at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow cardboard for the Scottish escalade Rory Hughes, released for the match by Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the figures.
Climo worsened the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half-time. He marked and transformed a solo test to raise the score to 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose began the second half-time, and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who left the ground on a civilian. During the retreat, Ayr took the fronts with a Stafford McDowall trial transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, the interim captain of Ayr, then received a yellow carton and again, Melrose tried his chance with an untransformed test by Bruce Colvine, which created a palpable tension.
But the home team got back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow carton for having touched Climo while he did not have the ball, from the penalty key, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's mule, which progressed.
Climo has transformed the test, like almost every time since the recapture, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kick box and sent Gregor Henry to the remote for the team's fifth test at home.
Still Game’s Star is Launched in Restaurant
Ford Kieran, the Star of Still Game, decided to make a career in the restaurant. The comedian was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old incarnated Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, which he wrote and coanimed with his long-standing partner on stage, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the nineth series will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to prepare for the post-Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a Scottish Sun source revealed that Kiernan wanted to engage in the "restauration floral environment" in Glasgow.
"Sea is for us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Navy patrols in a blinded boat in the naval headquarters La Paz.
Public buildings arose a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the naval bases show the following motorcycle: “The sea returns to us right.
Recovering is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia blocked, the memory of a lost coast in favor of Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is always well present, just as the desire to navigate the Pacific Ocean once again.
Bolivia has been expecting a decision from the International Court of Justice, which will be made on 1 October, after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course expects a positive result,” says Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice on high screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will pronounce Bolivian request, and that after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign transition to the ocean to Bolivian.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia (which faces a controversial fight for the reelection next year), also has a lot to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
“We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think there is little chance that the court will make a decision in favour of Chile, and that few things will change even in case of positive decisions.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no power to grant a Chilean territory, and has stated that it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case was “not complicated,” explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have even damaged it.
"The problem of sea access has been turned away by the current Bolivia administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ bellicious rhetoric knew all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and “a chance to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also contested the fact that Morales - which remains one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - used the maritime problem as a political bequila.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The Court’s decision is an opportunity to see that we must defeat the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not defeat its nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri expressed himself on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to keep the promises made at a Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He expressed himself at the time U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to restart nuclear diplomacy in the impasse over three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri stated it was "chemical" to think that the preservation of the sanctions and the US opposition to a statement that would end the Korean war will make the North shield.
Washington refuses to accept the statement in the absence of significant prior disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang’s seriousness regarding the resignation of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is a debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion showcases reveal the latest trends in key covers, perhaps available soon in your stores
If you want to add XXL parts to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun to 100%, do not look for anymore.
The creators Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collections of oversize hats in a PE19 show that honored the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
More extravagant hats than others invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delicious pieces into the showcases.
Valentino's light piece was an excentric beige hat decorated with a wide edge evoking a plum, which engulfed the mannequins' head.
Other oversize accessories included jewelry walled pastees, a witch hat and even an ananas. But these parts have not been imagined to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sweat lips and evoked more Hannibal Lecter than the High Couture.
A creation resembled a plunge equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another thought of a frozen ice cone.
And if you follow the trends of fashion, then you have luck.
According to style observers, imposing hats could come to your shopping streets.
.The XXL hats follow the seal of the Bomba, the broad-board pallet hat that stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that markets this hardly portable hat that floodd the social networks introduced another of its light creations on the podium: an almost as large beach bag as the bath shirt mannequin that wears it.
The burned orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia frankincense and a white leather handle, was the masterpiece of the PE19 Jacquemus riviera at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of celebrities Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing the big hats and beach bags coming in stores for the next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be demand for overweight accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of school excellence. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent examination results enhanced by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a over-measured school program, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable matters in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, you speak to him in his heart.”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and establish a trusted relationship with people from other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the examinations this year, we find that languages are top ranking, with the most important success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest rating, A.
The data collected from the 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest rating, A, in mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Today, languages as matters are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 British Employment and Skills Commission survey reveals that 17% of the difficulties employers face to recruit candidates are associated with insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in our globalized world.
No matter his career choice, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real benefit in the future thanks to this sustainable competence.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey from 4,000 adults living in the UK, 75% of them were not sufficiently dominated by a foreign language to keep a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have better chances of finding a pleasant job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach considerable languages for the UK in the 2020 perspective, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist staff in the field.
Scotland’s independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future reserves for them.
It is obvious that in a global commercial environment, languages are still of vital importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will start with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who get the beginnings of LeBron James at the Lakers in Los Angeles.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James would play Sunday in a pre-season opening against Denver’s Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
“More than one, less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, earlier in the week, James was asked for his plans for the pre-season program, which includes six matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to be ready.”
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube Channel)
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stairs, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
The vote to confirm the vacant position at the Supreme Court was delayed, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming half-mandate elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 (East Time) tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation vote should be delayed up to a week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings aims primarily to help Republicans win the field for November elections.
According to Reuters, the North American president said in his campaign that the five meetings were aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is such an essential element of its programme that the president will be able to reach as many states as possible at the beginning of this in charge of election campaign,” a spokesman of the Trump team told Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the meeting, scheduled tonight at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, could gather supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of Pittsburgh media."
Saturday, it will be the second visit of Trump in a month in West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, who is on the trail in surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to restart it in surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a political science specialist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is ready to fight to keep hope close to simple Sundays
After three simple, Saturday afternoon foursomes could well represent what was missing at the Ryder Cup.
The Balancing Movement of the Elena is a sporty concept invented from all pieces but in which players sincerely believe, and more than ever during such tournaments.
Where would they put the eagle now?
“They were taking six points in advance and now four, so this gives us some wings,” said Jordan Spieth while leaving for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, with four points in advance and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, have the feeling of having a little wind in the sun and have all the reasons to be encouraged, particularly by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together the whole day and may have earned each three points out of four.
Spieth proved terribly effective from green tea and gives an example.
The energy shouting of joy intensified as his game progressed. A crucial putt allowed him to equate to the fourth while Thomas and he were brought down two after two holes.
His puppet, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, raised a similar cry, of those who tell you that he believes the American team still in lice.
“We really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players, now.
18 holes to get rid of.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as confirms the history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but lovely European couple won four out of four matches and has no right to mistake.
Not only were "Moliwood" the only ones not to make a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy appears to circulate between them and the crowd delirant them as players to fight on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to enjoy a potential European victory while the sun rises on the National Golf.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly fought Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles of the first nine shots sent Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never could go out.
On the other hand, nobody is here to help you on Sunday.
Furballs and fursomes are so fascinating to be observed closely because of interactions between couples, advice they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can push into an eye clinch.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has made considerable progress over the last day, but this foursome session has also proved that Americans have the courage to fight, which some doubt, especially in the country.
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Last Day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 on the United States during Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two wins on a Tiger Woods in trouble, which allowed them to mark four points so far.
Well decided to keep the title she lost at Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning fourballs, faced with a disturbed American team.
The United States demonstrated greater resistance in the furrows and won two wins, but they failed to absorb the gap.
Jim Furyk’s men must necessarily score eight points in 12 Sundays in simple to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European recruitor to recruit four affiliate points, while Molinari and he, named “Moliwood” after a short weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup history to get four points in their first four matches.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed during the fourballs, they hit the pair consisting of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired of a 5 and 4 even more categories.
Woods, who trampled during the two Saturday matches, has shine a few times, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven affiliates.
Justin Rose, well-released for the morning fourballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning 2 to 1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and third in the world ranking.
Europe was not saved during the tournament that took place in the southwest of Paris, in a fresh but free time.
The triple winning Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved victory at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again struck Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, who lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point deviation, although the Furyk team, who held the crown, had to make no match to preserve its trophy.
After being seconds for two days, however, they may not return to a contra-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says disarmament can’t be done unilaterally without confidence.
Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen its disobedience to the United States and that it would be impossible for its country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the annual World Organization General Assembly, Ri Yong Ho claimed that last year North Korea had taken important "good will" measures, such as the stop of nuclear tests and missiles, the dismantling of the site of nuclear tests and its commitment to not spreading weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see any corresponding response from the United States,” he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we be the first to disarma ourselves unilaterally.”
While reiterating North Korea's well-known opposition to Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach of denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps gradually, its statement proved important in its not rejecting the idea of a unilateral denuclearization as a one-sided past.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump made in Singapore on June 12 at the first summit between a U.S. President and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work for a “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean War (1950-1953), but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected requests to soften severe international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists that North Korea first proceeds to denuclearization and emphasizes pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercitive manner, even opposing "the declaration of war end."
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us flooded do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our infidelity.”
Ri did not comment on the second summit between Kim and Trump before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
The minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: “If the party involved in the question of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a disaster.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from that of last year, when he stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to point North Korean missiles on the territory of the North American after the “bad” President Trump qualified Kim as “missile man” in suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened last year before the United Nations to “destroy” North Korea, did not praise this year for the courage with which Kim implemented measures for disarmament, but added that there was still a lot to do and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea would disarma.
“It can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn’t matter,” he said.
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures adopted.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to strengthen Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile funding.
Pompeo met Ri in front of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo had gone to North Korea three times, but his last trip was a little disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but in the following hours North Korea denounced its " gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to uninstalling a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President, Kim demands the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has established a new course that allows all graduate students to sleep more and fight against the growing machist trend that consists of studying by consuming caffeine all night.
A professor noted that most students from the world’s best university don’t know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is according to him the first of the genre in the United States.
After giving a conference on the effects of sleep privation on learning, the idea came to him.
At the end, a student approached me and asked, "Why is this only been told to me last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
Speaking for the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, claimed that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding students suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course time consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a bedroom containing different objects (coffee cups, curtains, baskets, books...) on which students click to know the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performances and the importance of integrating a routine before bed.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, assault, depression, and cancer.
A campus map containing interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
However, we believe they have the right to know this information - in the same way as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on health," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the culture of pride to spend a white night still exists, and it adds that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students make sleep shortage a growing problem.
The fact that having enough sleep and good quality should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a way of extinction, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and forced him to insist that he would be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all graduate students to follow a similar study program before joining the renowned institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to provide an alarm both for the time of sleep and for the time of awakening, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disorders.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men fall
The Rangers suffered a new hard strike outside, the Dolly Menga attack that led Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to Livingston to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team was hoping to record its first victory in the move from its 4-1 triumph in February to St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team at the derivative, eight points behind the Hearts, leading the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers' team, shortly inspired, failed to equate.
While the Rangers now fall into sixth place, Livingston rises in third place, just behind Hibernian on the difference in goals.
And other difficulties could make it feel for the Rangers, the arbitrator Calum Spence who had to be treated for a head injury following the jet of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which scanned Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-final.
Holt, for him, chose the same Livi 11 who pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would have been excited to see that his well-trained team swallowed his opponents in each round.
The Rangers may have mastered the balloon, but Livingston has made it more.
They should have scored at two minutes, when Menga's first shooting sent Scott Pittman on the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle of the field left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful strike towards Captain Craig Halkett, but his co-defender Alan Lithgow was only able to reach the second gate.
The Rangers managed to take control, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had to benefit from a penalty after the frank strike when Steven Lawless and he were in collision but arbitrator Steven Thomson denied Colombia's requests.
The Rangers only benefited from two shots in the first period, but the former Ibrox guard, Liam Kelly, was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly and a hit of Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening of the score at the 34th minute was registered against the game race, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Again, the Rangers failed in front of Jacobs’ stop.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher resigned the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a final while in simplicity.
Gerrard reacted in the mid-time by replacing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the alier appeared in front of Morelos, but the impressive Kelly hurried to block.
Nevertheless, Livingston has continued to push visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett shaking long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the advantage in the last few moments, but McGregor took a good deal to rebuild Jacobs before Lithgow went next to the goal.
The Rangers replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again called for a penalty at the end of the game while he was at the recordings with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of our Almanach Sunday Morning: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE TURNE COMPUTER... was born future physician Johannes Wilhelm " Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, Geiger has also become fundamental in pop culture, as you can see in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man asked, “What is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, we use it to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Thanks to these headphones, we can actually hear the effects of atoms released in minerals by radioactivity.”
Evans: "Tell me, it's sure it jumps here!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that bears its name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “discover” cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to “discover” cancer cells and kill them
As part of treatment, the vaccine indicates the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and transforming them into laboratory
They can then “discover” a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected.
A experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn from the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them into laboratory so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein “produces an increase in several types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells for their “learn” targeting cancer cells, has made its evidence as part of the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Coffee of a MAGA casket, Kanye West launched a Pro-Trump diatribe after passing to SNL.
It didn't happen well.
Kanye West hired on the plate after a chained performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he was going to appear in the 2020 elections.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, singing by carrying a Make America Great Again, West took it to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So often, I speak to Whites and they say, ‘How can you love Trump? He is racist!’”
“Well, if racism was worried, I would have left America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL broadcast started with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood headquarters laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the recording of West's diatribe was released on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock was going to laugh at West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the coils due to his casquette.
“They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on my head.
They put pressure on me!
And then they say that I am in a bow,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see him, you want to burn him?” and he says he would wear his head of superman, because no one can dict his acts. Do you want the world to progress?
Try love.”
His comments attracted him at least twice the public’s escapes and the members of the SNL seemed to be embarrassed, says Variety. One person on the spot told the magazine: “A silence of death fell on the whole plateau.”
West had been called to replace the last minute Ariana Grande singer, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West has disarmed many people by singing the song I Love it in a bottle costume.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU TO HAVE TEEN TO THE FOLLE.”
But Karen Hunter, the show’s animator, tweeted that West was simply “loyal to himself, and that it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music, his clothes, or by supporting his art) who, in my opinion, adopts and deviates a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And we too,” she added.
Before the release, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's traces, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the legendary fire Prince, which changed his name into symbol, then that of the artist previously known as Prince.
Belfast: Indictment of attempted murder after a white weapon aggression in a restaurant

According to the police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused should appear before the first-instance court in Belfast on Monday.
The heads of charge will be examined by the public ministry.
Kit Harington, the headset of the Game of Thrones series, takes into account toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his fine lame role, Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, HBO's violent medieval fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor took the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this kind of role on the screen often brings young boys to go for hard to cook to make themselves respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he said “something is wrong” and addresses the issue of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a 31-year-old Game of Thrones covedette, confessed that he was "continuing" to address this issue.
“Personally, I think deeply that we have misleaded masculinity.”
“What lessons have we taught young men who become adults, compared to the problem that is now?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for increased toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued, “What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What do television and street teach young boys to think that they must behave like this to be a man?
I think that's really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There is obviously something that is blowing.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he wouldn’t do prologues or successes when the series will end next summer, claiming to have ended with “the battlefields and the horses.”
From November, Kit will be the headquarters of a recapture of True West, by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that the meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing ever happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my life later,” he said.
Rose interviewed Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in Leslie’s family domain.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the population with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are involved.
Nearly 40,000 new cases have been reported during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients have been contaminated during sexual relations, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus has rapidly spread in some regions of the country due to contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from one year to another, the number of HIV-positives in China has increased by 100,000 people.
In the Chinese LGBT community, the transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was punished in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexual men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs since 2003.
Maxine Waters denied that a GOP employee had disclosed data on senators, and denounced "dangerous lies" and "complot theories".
Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages dedicated to lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were supported by “extreme right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It seems that the information disclosed included the addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Ustah.
The information was online on Thursday by an unknown in Capitole Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape occurred some time after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters Office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfunded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
“My team member, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the escape of this information.”
“This fake allegation is completely false and a true lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly raised online criticisms, including by Ari Fleischer, the former White House press attachment.
“This denial is anger,” he wrote.
“This indicates that it does not have the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something she hasn’t done, she shouldn’t be angry.
She shouldn't be provocative.
It should not question the accused’s reasons.
She must remain calm and sealed.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democratic critics against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of appearing too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters’ headquarters during the mid-mandate elections, also reported his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s huge,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned “the authorities and services responsible for the application of the laws concerned” about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are dismantled,” she added, “and that they are responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team.”
Johnny English has hit again. Parodie of Rowan Atkinson, sub-double spy
It has now become a tradition of searching for the scope of Brexit in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resuming of the action comedy Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will ironic self-satisfaction on the question of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new opportunity to export our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with the eye-scarped and the rubber face, saw his renewed license for the second time in a confused context - that name indicates first of all that it is a great comic creation designed for a non-english audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his suspicious attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspicion of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the guy who performs a small note in The Fire Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Initially, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard television ads, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathetic moments.
I liked Johnny English getting closer to a helicopter while he was wearing a medieval army and the rotor's pales were briefly struck against his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is emphasized, although humor is rather insufficient and strangely overflow, especially when “serious” licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make themselves fully confident with comedy.
The humor seems more targeted to children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's far-reaching meastures are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's film gags in Bean's character.
The first of the current news is that the UK has serious problems.
A computer pirate infiltrated the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great destruction of agents in service - a slightly low-enverguent role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that makes the vase over a prime minister who is a pumping character at the edge of the crisis and who already suffers from political impopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this almost-May character, but there’s nothing to put under the teeth in the scenario.
Her intelligence advisers have informed that each active spy has been compromised, she will have to get someone out of her retirement.
This means that we need to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school master, but who secretly gives lessons on how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farces here, because English offers a Rock Academy form spying academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and finds Bough, his former long-haired partner, again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, associated with a submarine commander, a fun hockey baton role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So, Batman and Robin, who create great trouble with the secret services of His Majesty, move to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the empowerment of the technological charismatic billionaire who is said to be able to solve the UK computer problems: the silent Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of farfeluous jokes: under the decoration of servers, they put fire in a shiny French restaurant; they create a chaos by fooling on the luxurious Volta veil; and English triggers a true anarchy when it tries, with a hood of virtual reality, to get acquainted with the interior of Volta.
All arrests are assured for this last sequence, but despite all, there are no bad things for children in all of this.
A rather moderate film.
I couldn't stop thinking, as for other Johnny English films: can the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really value his talent?
The Working Party refused to have a plan for the British to work four days but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Working Party has to examine a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to make the workers benefit from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an additional day of vacation.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend while continuing to touch the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would agree with the party's economic programme and plans to orient the country for workers.
The transition to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a means for workers to benefit from economic changes.
An important source within the Working Party said at the Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.”
“This will not be done in a night, but a four-day work week is a goal that will match the party’s approach to rebalance the economy for workers and its global industrial strategy.”
The Working Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party was committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the Working Party as a whole.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: “A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not considered by it.”
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the last week’s working conference to give details on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell has declared himself committed to regain power in the hands of “anonim administrators” and “profits” in public utility companies.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also provide that current water companies shareholders may not recover all their deposits as the working government could operate "deductions" due to alleged driving disparities.
It has also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into corporate boards, as well as the establishment of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the private corporate capital to employees, which will borrow up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on “60 Minutes” if the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court was delayed at least a week after the FBI investigation into the accusations against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's conclusions could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, correspondent of the 60 Minutes program, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy has become more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
“When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were formulated, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, undecided.”
However, Graham's vote appears to be grafted in the stone.
"I made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and I would need an explosive charge," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, altering Christine Blasey Ford.
“And the people she named couldn’t check it.
It's a 36-year-old business.
I don’t see anything new that changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will welcome the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive palmares of stars and invest with an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now at its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people come to the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the population’s real goal, namely end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, whose first edition took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are ready to pay a VIP ticket), the spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, calling or making any other useful effort in order to raise awareness of the population against poverty.
But to what extent can Global Citizen still achieve its goal in the next 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people by a free concert really convincing them to call for action, or is it just another example of “cliticism” - a situation in which people really think to make the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, who pleaded for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to stimulating global leaders to take commitments and to adopt policies of over $37 billion that would change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and advertisements resulting from its shares, of which a tranche of at least $10 billion has already been deducted or withdrawn.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives committed to “aid children to develop their full potential”, while promising 35 million Sterling pounds helping Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens messages.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a low-page note in history,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador to the program The Power of Nutrition at a concert held in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that, following more than 5,000 actions aimed at requesting the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5,000 million women and children in the framework of nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, “what makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, as the major civil rights defense movements and the fight against apartheid before us, we will reach that, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animate the show.
U.S. could appeal to the Navy to create a "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In order to prevent Russian energy from coming to markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the U.S. Navy, said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Interior Secretary, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s presence in Syria – particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government – is a pretext that allows it to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in East Europe, the southern center of Europe,” he said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy it.
“The United States can, with our Navy, ensure that the maritime paths are open and, if necessary, obstruct to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market,” he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “Energy Consumer Speaker” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, emphasising that they are actually identical.
“With Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less in the operation and replacement of fuel,” he said, while referring to Russia saying that it has “more than one cord to its arc” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at the time the Trump administration committed to dynamising exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin “prisoner” in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfaithful competition.
In a speech in September in Moscow following a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, “I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers.”
The position of the United States has caused negative reactions by Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of attending the 2020 presidential elections, Massachusetts Senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider the possibility of attending presidential elections after half-mandate elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed her intention to present herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for this reason a woman will have to be at the top,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider submitting my candidate to the presidential election.”
Warren said what he thought of President Donald Trump during the public meeting, claiming that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
“I’m very worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been honest in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Twitter: “Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s voters are not of the opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey from the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe political research centre, 58 percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters claimed that the Senate should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supported, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% in favour of it.
Among the other names of Democrats mentioned for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s PTSD during Donald Trump’s meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after his enrolment in September.
He was arrested and accused of a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my own son currently experiences, what he feels as he returns, I can link it to other families who feel the consequences of the PTSD and some injuries with which our soldiers come back," she told the public at the Donald Trump meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin qualified his arrest as a "tabo subject" and said about his son and other former fighters that "they come back a bit differently, hardened, wondering whether they respect what their comrades and members of the Air Force, and every other military, gave to the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman from the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of conjugal violence and violence against a woman, interfering with a marriage violence and possession of a weapon in a state of embryos.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial contest on the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial contest against the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of a gang or domestic violence.
Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a memory for an asylum seeker who contested this policy, NBC News said.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and her sons, members of violent gangs,” had attacked her, but the U.S. authorities decided to reject her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries faced widespread gang problems and conjugal violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy canceled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigrant Refugee Council, which authorized illegal immigrants to flee conjugal violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney-General of Columbia, said on Friday in a statement that the new policy “is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle,” the friend of the Curie said in his memory.
Lawyers also supported in memory that the policy of refusing to enter immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary work.”
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing conjugal violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
“I feel very stressed,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her young fever boy in Palu, in an evacuation center.
“Every moment, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their devastated homes, collecting demolished goods and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by 7.5 magnitude earthquake were undermerged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of the back and shoulder, were sitting in front of the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to strong persistent replies.
The tears filled his eyes when he told him how he felt the violent earthquake that pulled out the hotel room at the fifth floor where he was living with his wife and his daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was broken into the wall ruins, I think," Haris told Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or to my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intristing" by means of "propaganda ads"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper spent a four-page advertisement enchanting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China in an American newspaper, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last Wednesday that China Daily paid the supplement in the Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections on November 6, an accusation that China refuses.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to interfere in U.S. elections, Trump noted what U.S. officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign led by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply mutual tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the Commercial War, China’s tariff measures were intended to hit exporters of states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt workers, farmers and American companies.
China writes Branstad in an article of opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “it is doubled its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press.”
“In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the U.S. tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by inserting a paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in Beijing’s press release, you will find little controversial voices and you will not see the real reflection of divergent opinions that Chinese may have on the troubled Chinese economic trajectory, as the media strongly obey the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers has avoided publishing” his article, not saying which newspaper.
Analysts Warn that Republicans Align Electrics to Approach Half Mandate Elections Due to Kavanaugh’s Disaster
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a negative reaction, especially in women, could occur during the next half-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this issue have been extremely alive, and most Republicans have already shown publicly that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, claimed that “we cannot go back.”
Reeher added that he doubted that the last minute efforts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation are sufficient to calm down voters' anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, Chief Advisor and National Speaker of the MoveOn Progressive Group, “women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November,” she said on September 28, according to Washington’s newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic reported, the protesters sang “November comes!” in the Senate’s hallway while Republicans governing the Judiciary Committee chose to advance Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be demeasured,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say it’s already high, it’s true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the electorates of the districts and in the young electorates aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public deposition explained in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s nomination, analysts had let the reaction be believed that it would be likely to be alive if Republicans made the confirmation advance.
According to NBC News, former President of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week, “It has become a confused disturbance for the GOP.”
“It’s not just the vote of the committee or final vote, or Kavanaugh’s appointment, but it’s also the way Republicans managed the situation and the way they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group assisting elected Democrats in the TV newspaper.
As a result of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, however, Americans seem divided about the credibility of both parties, a small majority penchant on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey revealed that 41% of the consulted people believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates the allegations made by Ford and at least another accused, Deborah Ramirez, after Senator Flake’s pressure.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of eternity at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s, the candidate to the Supreme Court would have shown him his gender parties during a party.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s Solid Free Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored as well as persons authorized to access such or such information.
In an exclusive interview granted to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt wanted to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said about the launch.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data store” or DPL.
This may include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on a single browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal responsibility through data.”
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company brings appropriate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, of a few developers working contractually on the project and a community of volunteer codeers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that his team and his team are not yet in discussion with "Facebook and Google" to see if it is necessary or not to operate a complete change where all of their business models are completely changed in a moment.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission [d’Inrupt] is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem in order to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an ecclesiastical of the First World War decorated by the Cross of Victoria
The only ecclesiast of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in its native town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and ignored that he had gained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a break in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, claimed that he was “brilliantly symbolic” to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s exploitation.
According to the London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on the Canal of Saint Quentin “through a very thick brownie and under the violent shooting of cannons of countryside and mitrailleuses.”
Later, he hurried onto the shooting line and, with the “greatest bravery,” guided the line before he jumped a canon of campaign to him alone and summed up three soldiers from the dismissal.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s acts were “a thing to the height of which I will never be, but which makes me humble.”
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also posted a crown after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann confessed that he felt “very honored to be part of the show” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero reflects in the support that will be brought to him by many people.”
The fans of mixed martial arts were awake all night to watch Bellator 206. In place they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night watching a Bellator 206 well filled, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event included 13 battles, including six on the main sheet, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK, on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, the UK spectators were siding when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were discontented to stay awake until the early hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the transition to the animated drawing for children as “a sort of bad joke.”
As regards the transmission, Bellator’s Chief Marketing and Communications Vice-President Dave Schwartz said that “governmental regulations have arranged that this content was not adapted at 6 a.m., so they had to go back to children’s emissions.”
"Peppa the pig", yes."
Scott Coker, the president of Bellator, said they were going to work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
“I believe that when I think of re-diffusion, I think we probably can find a solution,” Coker said.
“But it is six hours of the morning a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday or Monday.
But we work there.
Believe me, when the program basculated, there were a lot of messages in both directions and they were not all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee that this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six – as usual – and we have tried to give more for fans and we have broken everything.
It’s a regrettable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lower” in terms of sexuality
Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling less than others because of his sexuality – but that has pushed him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before going to secondary school that “everybody wasn’t like me.”
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs broadcast by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual broadcaster, Kirsty Young, took several months’ leave due to her illness.
Appeared as a shipbreaker in Laverne’s first release, Daley confessed that he felt “less than” all the other children growing up because “it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said, “Today, these feelings of being lower and different are the real things that have given me the power and strength needed for my success.”
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was “something,” he continued.
The double Olympic bronze medal is now a renowned LGBT militant and has benefited from its participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to request more countries to discriminate homosexuality.
He said he expressed himself because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and thus wanted to return “hope” to others.
Triple world champion said he “wasn’t expecting” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013
Daley married his 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you see so much at such a young age," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had the same high and low.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, I only thought to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after a brain cancer.
Daley confessed that his father did not agree that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their London 2012 tickets, because he wanted to be in the first row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you won’t be here anymore to be in the first row,’ he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and had to stop breathing and be dead so that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“It was all I had dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a crowd at the Olympics, there’s nothing better,” he said.
In addition, this inspired him his first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and always gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15, BST.
A Mickelson out of shape at the Ryder Cup Bank on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will perform a record this Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to go straight to prevent it from being a disastrous stage.
Mickelson, who participated in the two-year competition for the twelfth time, was deleted by Captain Jim Furyk of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the heart of the action, as it was so often for the United States, the fifth-century great champion shared his day between the role of supporting and skinfining of his game at the stand in order to remedy his pains.
He has never been the greatest leader, even at the top of his career. At 48 years old, he is not the most suitable for the difficult National Golf, where the long rough systematically punishes the strikes.
And as if the course was not scary enough in itself, Mickelson, at the nineth Sunday match, confronted Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner, who teamed this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches.
If the Americans, at four down at the beginning of the 12 simple matches, take a good start, Mickelson’s match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his trust in his man, but he couldn’t say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in his back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a great confidence in him.
He is a legendary champion and he has added so many things to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two matches.
I planned more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the Ryder Cup's most controversial meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at the Ryder Cup that has never reached the heights of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven defeats, although Furyk has affirmed that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He’s funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to laugh at people, and it’s a wonderful guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think younger players had the pleasure to meet him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than playing.”
Captain of the European Section, Thomas Bjorn, knows that advances could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that an unnecessary advance before the simple of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
Denmark disputed its first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points in advance on the Americans, but finally climbed to the ranking with the smallest deviation possible on the arrival line, winning him 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
“You don’t stop reminding you that we were going widely to Valderrama; we had a big advance to Brookline, where we failed, as well as to Valderrama, where we won, but fair,” Bjorn said after watching the 2018 Ranking to win 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday at National Golf to lead 10-6.
The story will prove to us, to me and to all the members of this team, that this is not the end.
Go deep into it tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
It's not finished until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, i.e. trying to win this trophy, and that is what we have to stay focused on.
I have always affirmed to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - these are the best players in the world."
Raviing his players’ performances on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never go forward on that point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of gloves.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and it will go differently.
It’s fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you’re there lonely, you’re put to the test at the height of your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message to make the players pass, is to shoot the best of yourself tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, you have to go get the best of yourself too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will strive to ensure that his players get better results individually than as co-workers, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced the two ends of these revolts last day, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing the result of the “Miracle of Medinah”, where Europe defeated the victory.
“I remember every word,” he explains in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, had done to rally his players on the last day.
“We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medinah.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, makes a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
We established our training accordingly and put the guys as we thought to have to do it, we try to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to carry out the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
“I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course,” Bjorn said on his simple selections.
Germany's new warship again delayed
According to local media, the new German Navy freight had to be launched in 2014 to replace the aging warships dated to the Cold War, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defect systems and exponential expenditure.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the Admiral vessel of all new fregates in Bade-Wurtemberg, was delayed in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have integrated the Navy in 2014, but the concerns that arose after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be replaced by the aging fregates of the Brême class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful canon, a range of anti-air and antinavir missiles as well as some furious technologies, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frosts for a period of up to two years outside the ports of attachment.
According to Die Zeit, however, incessant delays mean that war-guardships - which should allow Germany to project its offshore force - will already be obsolete when they are put in service.
Last year, the damned F125 frégate made big titles when the German Navy officially refused to use the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss naval factory in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a naval manufacturer after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were unknown, but the German media mentioned a number of "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unnecessary in the event of deployment in a fighting mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Bade-Wurtemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 seafarers, which corresponds to half of the old Bremen crew.
In addition, the ship appears to be significantly overloaded, reducing its performance and reducing the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the Rheinland-Pfalz of 7,000 tons weighs twice as heavy as compared to similar class vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the failures of the computer system, the price of the project as a whole - including crew training - also becomes a problem.
It is said that he reached the astronomical sum of $3.1 billion (3.6 billion) compared to $2.2 billion at the beginning.
The problems related to new Fregates are particularly important in the light of recent alerts that Germany's naval force decreases.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the Navy is “in fact short of ships capable of deploying itself.”
The official stated that the situation had caused a snowball effect over time, because the old ships were dismissed but no replacement ships were designated.
He regretted that none of the Bade-Wurtemberg class fridges could join the Navy.
The National Trust monitors the Secret Life of Sweatshirts
New research carried out in a field of Scotland Highlands seeks to reveal how sharks use the landscape in their food search.
It is hoped that the observations will bring a new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common pimples and sopranos as well as long-ear brun chauves and Daubenton at the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of the chaussers throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound will allow you to determine the frequency of crashes of turkeys as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a housing report will be drawn up in order to draw up a detailed table of their behaviour across the territory.
Rob Dewar, a Nature Conservation Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for the sharks and how they are used by each of these species.
This information will help determine the benefits of housing management works such as the creation of prairies and the best way to preserve forests for sows and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of saurics has significantly decreased over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect the pearls and lead to the loss of their habitat.
Winds and lighting can also represent a risk, as well as killing papers and some chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as company cats attacks.
Souris aren't really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching probes.
They use sophisticated ecolocalization technique to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the shaves very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, perchoir inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland’s sausages on the site of Threave in Dumfries-et-Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scotland’s sausages.
David Thompson, domain manager, claims that the site is the ideal territory for them.
“Here, in Threave, we have an ideal place for hotspots,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still a lot to learn about the sharks, so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what the sharks need to prosper.”
It emphasizes the importance of verifying the presence of caves before proceeding to maintain the property, because by destroying the property without the desire of a single nid of maternity, it can thus cause the death of 400 females and young people, or even the disappearance of a whole local population.
The souris are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their pearls.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland’s chief at Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our sharks and about many of our species, we don’t know what’s happening in their populations for the moment.”
Ronaldo refuses prosecutions while his lawyers are preparing to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualified the allegations of rape against him as "false information," and claimed that people "will become acquainted" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to pursue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He would have paid him $375,000 to keep silence on the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million fans in a live video posted on Instagram, a few hours after the release of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, called this information "fake information".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is a fake information,” the Golden Ball five winner told the camera.
“They want to become a pub using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s fine,” said the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel about these allegations, which they have qualified as “unacceptable allegation of suspicions in the field of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would request a redress for “moral damages proportionate to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night box, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to documents deposited at the Clark County court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and assured him to be a "good guy" at "99%" but he didn't know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that these were consented.
Mayorga also claimed to go to police and that photos of her injuries had been taken in a hospital, but she later accepted a friendly regulation because she felt "threated by repressives" and feared "suffer public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to cancel this regulation because she remains traumatic by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined Italian gigantic Juve as part of a contract of €100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “everything regret” the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Commerce, the United Kingdom would “trust it forever” if it had just lost its status as a world leader in automotive construction after Brexit.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its Burnaston factory near Derby, if Britain withdraws from the EU without an agreement.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Auris and Avensis vehicles, built nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
“I think that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, production will stop in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what car manufacturers qualify for risks for the supply chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated in “tendud flow”, parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for custom-made vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without agreement, there could be border disturbances that, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of coins.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold the inventory more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore the production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that, as I said, will not only take advantage of the current success, but also take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4's Today broadcast.
“Obviously, not only Toyota but other manufacturers, we must absolutely be able to maintain what has proven to be an excellent set of supply chains.”
If Toyota had not been able to specify how long production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the coordinator of the united trade union at the factory and who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said his members are increasingly worried: “My experience says, once these jobs disappear, they will never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
The White House announces Trump and Rosenstein meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "repeated for a week", while the struggle for the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein supervises Robert Mueller’s work, the special adviser responsible for investigating Russian intervention in the elections, the ties between Trump’s and Russia employees and the possible barriers to justice exercised by the president.
The question of whether Trump will send back or not the Deputy Prosecutor General, and thus threaten Mueller’s independence, feeds the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken to wear a micro to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied these affirmations.
However, last Monday, he appeared in the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to send Mr. Rosenstein back, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission, in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford witnessed, one of the women who accused her of sexual assault.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s press attachment, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance to Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been fixed for this, this could be this week, I could see if we resign a week again given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I like to keep the press informed.”
The statement would be contested by some journalists: since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference in the White House.
The animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rareness of conferences was not due to an aversion for “demagogical” television reporters, although she said: “I have nothing against the fact that they are eating the gallery.”
Then she let me hear that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that “the president participates in more questions-answer sessions than any other president before him”: “We have checked the figures.”
“Press conferences will always be held,” Sanders said, but “if the press is lucky to question directly the US President, it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We try to do it frequently, you have seen it well in the last few weeks, and this will take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Regularly, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences alone.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, making a distracted appearance and occasionally a strange appearance in front of the gathering journalists.
About Brexit concerns, EU Health Secretary for Workers in NHS Scotland
The Health Secretary wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and wish to stay in position after Brexit.
Scottish parliamentary Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of status requests for European citizens working in its decentralized public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal continued between the UK and the EU and should lead to decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the absence of an agreement.
I understand that this period should be very disturbing for each of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of its nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that consolidate and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
After a head injury, Christion Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery
Sselon Mike Organ, Tennessee State, Christion Abercrombie, the secondary of the Tennessee Tigers, was surgery after a head injury on Saturday during the defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, head coach of the state of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the half-time.
“He arrived on the touch line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a citizen and taking another exam.
A Tennessee State Representative told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center’s operational hall.
Harris stated that there was "no further clarity on the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury had occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete student, is at its first season with the state of Tennessee after transfer from Illinois.
He had five plaques in total on Saturday before leaving the match, which brought his total of the season to 18 plaques.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher timber right if they buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher timber rights if they buy a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help homeless under new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
Increase of stamp right will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury is expected to collect up to 120 million Sterling pounds per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher timber tax if they buy a property in the UK - extra money will serve to help homeless, said Theresa May today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign’s success to attract young voters by committed to providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
Increase of stamp rights will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will help strengthen government efforts to help homeless people.
This surplus - which is added to the current timber right, including the higher levels set up two years ago on secondary residences and rentals - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling pounds per year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by UK non-residents, causing rising prices and preventing first-accessers from becoming a place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country – including the capital – have become “photos” because of the high number of foreign buyers who are mostly living outside the country.
This new policy occurs just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right to help more young people acquire a first home.
In accusing the major construction companies of maintaining real estate prices at a high level by reaching land without using them, he invited Ms May to give up the quotas on affordable housing in order to resolve the “local disgrace” in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn has presented an attractive series of proposals for housing reforms, including the control of rents and the elimination of “innocent” expulsions.
He also wishes to give the advice of broader powers to build new housing.
May said: “Last year, I said I would dedicate my position as Prime Minister to the renaissance of the British dream – that every new generation would have a better life.
To do this, we need to repair our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house only for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing property has become far away and the misery of homeless remains too real.”
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland’s technician Jack Ross explains that his “ultimate ambition” is to become Scotland’s selector at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland is excited to face the challenge of bringing the Northeast club back to life, which currently occupies the third place of the League 1, at three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren into the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for the B division and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But I grew up following Scotland’s matches in Hampden with my father and that’s something I never forgot.
This opportunity, however, would only appear if I succeed in managing the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland selectors are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician says he has no hesitation to retreat behind such emblematic names in such a large club, already rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured in light of the question “Can I bring this club back to Premier League?”
Due to the structure and infrastructure of this club, it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League,” he added.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably consider myself a success here only if I managed to bring the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months within Hearts coaches.
He then helped Alloa rise from a relief into a third division and transformed St Mirren, who was on the edge of the relief, into a great winner of the championship the next season.
Ross says more comfortable now than during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Alloa’s support “was probably a true carrefour,” he recalls.
“I really thought being a coach would be better for me than playing.
It seems strange because I’ve gone out well, I’ve earned my life well and I’ve benefited from some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to be resolved every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is very good for me.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I’ve been in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer canicule made British pubs’ revenue rise in difficulty, but has pushed pressure on the restaurants chains.
The figures indicate that bars and pub groups recorded an increase of 2.7 percent of their sales in July, but restaurant revenue declined by 4.8.
Peter Martin, the CGA councillor, who assembled the data, said: “The longer sunshine and participation of England in the World Cup have made the month of July follow the model of June, where bars had experienced a 2.8% rise, except for restaurants, who have suffered a further major shock.
The 1.8% decline in the restaurant sector in June has only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where you serve alcoholic beverages are far the most spectacular, with more resemblance points than restaurants that lower them.
Food pubs have also suffered from sun effects, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out and take a drink.
In pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6% over the month, and food declined by 3%.”
Paul Newman, a recreational analyst and RSM hotel analyst, said: “These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in domestic sales.
Nothing is surprising that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, although an average drop in sales by 4.8 per cent is particularly painful, in addition to continuous cost pressure.
The long and hot summer would not have been less appropriate for food operators and the weather will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will give a well-meaning repeat.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the implantation.

On social media, a child in five has secret accounts that he hides to his parents
According to a survey, a child in five - some of which are only 11 - has secret social media accounts that he hides to his parents and teachers.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in "false Insta" pages
The news has emphasized concerns about the publication of sexual content
20 percent of students say they have a "main" account to show their parents
A child in five - some of which are only 11 - opens a social media account that he keeps hidden for adults.
A survey conducted by 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth of “fake Insta accounts” – a reference to Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has emphasized concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20 percent of students said they would manage a “main” account cleaned to show it to their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have a double profile, half of students recognized having private accounts.
CSM chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are trying to create online places where parents and teachers don’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will represent athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as non-executive director at the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the Scottish most decorated athlete athlete and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish, British, and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely from its participation in the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I really want to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the tests of 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular BBC commentator, was unable to walk after undergoing a transitional Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had an accident.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors said that only time would sound if I would get back or how much.
It was an experiencing work, but I recovered completely, I started walking again, and today I do agile exercises!
“Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Online, an advertisement on milk shooting comparing mothers and cows shares opinions
An online advertising from a company offering a milk shooter compares breastfeeding mothers to cows during trade.
In order to mark the launch of what is called “first quiet milk in the world,” Elvie, a big public technology company, has launched a bold advertising inspired by a music video to show the freedom that her new milk offers to breastfeeding women.
In a liver-filled cow row, four true mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are “Yes, I move myself, but you don’t see a cow” and “If you haven’t noticed it, it’s my breasts, not breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Pomp him, pump him, I feed him, pump him, pump him, pump him, help the women enduring milk.”
However, the advertising, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, has raised an online questionnaire.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received contradictory reactions from the public, many of which say it makes light on the "horrows" of the dairy industry.
“A pitter decision is to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from them in the days after their birth,” one of them wrote.

Another commented: “It is a comprehensible trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to make a milk shooter for mothers who keep their baby?
Someone else added: “A advertisement is so unconnected.”
Others defended advertising, for example, a woman admitting that she found the "hilarating" song.
“I think it’s an idea of engineering.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pomper gave me the impression of being a cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny advertising for mothers who pull their milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feel like “cows.”
This is not an advertising that makes the praise of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women reveal to have danced with the discreet shooting strips dissimulated in their backing.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk-treatment say they feel like they are cows.
However, the Elvie milk shooter is completely silent, without threads or pipes, and inserts itself discreetly into a breastfeeding support, giving women the freedom to move, keep their baby and even out while drawing their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s milk shooter is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast-feeding milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a funny and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will gain.
This isn't the first time Elvie shot one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the podium of designer Marta Jakubowski while she used this product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently settled in a camp at the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, partly due to the fact that Trump's severe talks and policies have made it difficult to make children's positions more difficult in respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were paperless immigrants themselves and they were afraid to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by dealing with the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult home members should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made a request for a survey of non-company minors.
The agency subsequently confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no judicial history.
“Nearly 80% of people who are respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
According to refugee speakers, in order to treat the case of children faster, the authorities have established new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will compare by videoconference, rather than in person, to appeal their case with regard to their legal status before an immigration judge.
Persons deemed ineligible will be quickly expelled.
According to the respondents and reports submitted by the Refugee Network in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more they are likely to become anxious or depressive, which may lead to strikes of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large establishment like Tornillo, these concerns are worsened by the fact that signs that a child is in trouble are more likely to be neglected due to its size, according to the child's rights defenders.
They added that moving children to camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could emphasize a trauma that many have difficulty managing.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw on the ground.
In an allocation to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in this country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would “be treated accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without condition,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem said the “war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria, while more than 300,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have been rooted out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to carry out this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are purified” both of the two terrorist groups and of any “illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, most of which form and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this country devastated by the war, France has more than 1,000 soldiers in place.
Moualem told refugees that the conditions were favorable to their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “prolifering irrational concerns” that dissuaded refugees from returning.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union said there would be no support for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war would not be concluded.
The United Nations diplomats argue that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a tampon zone in the last rebellious fortress of Idlib has enabled political negotiations to progress.
The Russian-Turkish deal avoided a large-scale attack on the province where three million people live, by Syrian forces supported by Russia.
However, Moualem emphasized that the deal provided for “specific deadlines” and issued the hope that the military measures will target the jihadists, particularly the fighters of the Front Nusra, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who will “be eliminated”.
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to soon summon the first meetings of a new committee gathering members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the path for the elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, affirming that the group's work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current Constitution", and formulated a warning against any intervention.
Why Trump won a second mandate
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators hopefully, destitution and scandal lead him to leave his presidency early.
What would probably be “the most spectacular final of a presidency!”
At the moment, the public does not show any signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, advanced clock rates have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million watch watches, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show”, which reaches 3.5 million watches during big evenings, is the first cable TV channel.
“It’s a matter that attracts people because it’s not something we understand,” commented Neal Baer, ABC’s dramatic series “Designed Survivor”, who talks about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a chevroned comic author and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And some irrefutable truths about moving into the Hollywood Boys Club,” has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked him.
"He replied, 'Because he made me laugh,' said Ms Scovell.
Chaos has a playful value.
Obviously, unlike everything that is happening to television, Washington scenarios could determine the future of the Roe c. Wade case, whether families of immigrants can join and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the wealthiest spectators can allow.
And yet, it exceeds being an informed citizen when a panel of experts discusses the way Bob Woodward used a "deep knowledge" for his book "Fear", on Trump's leather trousers to $10,000, awarded by Daniel's leather and M. Manafort's consequence, "a postread of the Story's Worship."
I will never see Super Mario again in the same way.
“If a part of what he’s doing gives the impression of seeing a television reality, it’s because it’s making you missing something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing teams and everyday situation returns.
You can’t let yourself miss an episode, otherwise you’re on the trail.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he landed inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not be dismissed, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in play.
“I remember the time when we were animating all these crazy emissions and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money invads the most narrowest elections in half-mandate
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania was flooded with money, thanks to a re-alignment of the Congressional circuits that allowed two holders to dispute the same seat.
This district of the Pittsburgh district, which was recently restructured, is the headquarters of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who deployed his headquarters in another district during special elections in the last spring.
Lamb is measured to another owner, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly leads the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of Republicans.
The racing of the new 17th district led to a confrontation with the financing of electoral campaigns between the major branches of party funding, the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice won last March during a very popular special election in the 18th district of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
The politicians have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States planned to punish Salvador for its support for China and then resigned
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington had little opposition to.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to summon U.S. diplomatic missions leaders in Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against “their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” said Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Department in a statement.
But sanctions were intended only against Salvador, who received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, including to control drugs and provide them with developmental and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for Central America and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While the internal meetings were continuing, representatives of North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on the topic of security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year, seen as an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior administration officials clearly stated that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now express himself at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to show the importance of the administration assigned to the meeting, diplomats reported.
And the three U.S. emissors are peacefully returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new messages or severe punishments from Washington.
A spokesman from Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the anonymity cover.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study History
The next step could be the report of special lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible obstacle to Mr. Trump's justice. The public case is now supported by substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the question of a connivence of Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress control changes by hand, Mr. Trump will remain in the obligation to make accounts before that body, when he is ready to represent himself before voters and, perhaps, before a jury composed of his pairs.
There are many "if" here, and I do not claim that Trump's fall is inevitable - either that of his colleagues in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, the German officials were about to organize a coup of state against Hitler, if only the West had held him head and rejected the Czechoslovacs in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of meat that followed.
The course of history turns around these climbings and the inevitable walk of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are currently facing a number of these climbings.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump returns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation carried out by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed to secretly record the president and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his roles.
Mr. Rosenstein says Times reporting is inaccuracy.
"What if the recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or if it is confined to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for the mid-mandate elections for a Congress that will ask for accounts to Mr. Trump?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will spend a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovaki Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America and, sixty years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candlesticks on the swastika table.
With this heritage in heritage, I can’t be optimistic about our future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, faced with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a solid position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury canceled the midfielder Graham Dorrans from his first part of the season to the null match 2:2 against Villarreal, but it is convinced that the Rangers are able to get the best of such a result to achieve operations.
“It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team,” said the 31-year-old attacker.
“We went into the game thinking about getting something and we left it with a point.
We might have been able to win it at the end, but, in general, no match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half-time and we returned in the second half-time and we were the best team.
Thursday, it is another important European evening.
With a little luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have made a good result during their last match, however I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is of quality.
Let’s hope we can go forward now, leave the last season behind us and triumph.”
Women no longer find sleep due to this fear of saving their retirement
Even though the participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to deal with them, few people were discussing the issue with their family members.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not do the necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationwide Life Insurance branch.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouses and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and family to determine where and how you can get care, as these options can be an important factor in determining its cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your adviser is also able to help you establish a way to pay these fees.
Your long-term care funding decisions may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a purchase-value hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover these expenditure or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means of insurance.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at the passing.
Provide a healthcare procurement that will allow you to designate a trusted person who will verify your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider a procurement regarding your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensures payment of your invoices if you are hit by inability.
Think about the small details: Suppose your older parent has a medical emergency and he goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.
“There are not only the finances that are in play, but also the doctors,” Martin asked.

Police described the incident, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a “random act”.
The victim didn't see his aggressor.
His wounds are not threatening his life, and the police have launched a witness call.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities announced, and the balance should take place.
As communications were paralyzed, the emergency services were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, an area located north of Palu that is closer to the epiccenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
A few essential facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the top of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, the population of which was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a region that is more than 300 km (180 miles) of coasts northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the region, an administrative region located below a province, was estimated at 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, and especially of the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected several times by tsunamis for a century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of residences in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, making nine dead.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Sismic Fire Circle and is regularly cut by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake, occurring on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that deferred over 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes cut off the west coast of Sumatra from the end of March at the beginning of April.
A few hundred people have died on the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude of 6.8 earthquake reached the south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that touched the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake cut down the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people have been killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai islands along Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Surface earthquake dropped Pidie Jaya’s rule in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the destruction caused by the 2004 murderous earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami has been caused this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes cut off the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily blocked.
Sarah Palin's elderly son arrested for marriage violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old, originating in Wasilla, Alaska, was interpelled for suspicion of conjugal violence, opposed to a report of conjugal violence and resistant to arrest, according to a statement published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he would have taken the phone from a woman's familiarity who tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is temporaryly detained in Mat-Su’s temporary detention centre and is detained under $500 unwarranted warranty, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself “non-innocent,” when his complainant was asked, the network announced.
Palin faces three A-class crimes, which means that he could be sentenced to a jail punishment of up to one year and is liable for a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a lesser class B crime, sentenced to a day of prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are being brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is ongoing in the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of conjugal violence, interfering with the report of a conjugal violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of embryos related to the incident.
His companion claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after making the link between her son's violent behavior and the PTSD resulting from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died from the earthquake that landed the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and ravaged thousands of houses.
The networks of electricity and telecommunications are intact, and the balance of victims should take place in the coming days.
The earthquake declared itself just on the edge of the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu city at the time the tsunami collapsed on the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged attacker in New York who committed eight victims - a rare punishment that has not been applied in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, would have used a truck rented at Home Depot to attack a bicycle track on the West Side Highway road, in Lower Manhattan, driving on his pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intensively" murdered the eight victims and "intensively" inflicted serious body damage, according to the statement of intention to apply for the death penalty imposed at the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to lead to death penalty, according to the judicial document.
A few weeks after this assault, a major federal jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges, including eight charges of killing for extortion of funds, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crimes and one for crimes of violence and destruction of cars.
The attack needed “a thorough preparation and a premeditation,” the prosecutors claimed the method used by Saipov of “hateful, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not claimed death penalty in the context of prosecution for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was pronounced guilty of the murder of two drug dealers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for delivering to conspiracy and spying acts for the USSR over the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, demonstrated absence of remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to judicial documents.
According to the police, he told the investigators he was pleased with his acts.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been incited to commit the attack after watching Daesh's videos on his phone, according to the accused act.
He also asked to show Daesh’s flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded innocent to the 22 chiefs of charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “often disappointed” by the decision to prosecute.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accepting his guilty complainant and condemning him to jail to life without the possibility of liberation can only prolong the trauma related to these events for all interested ones,” Patton said.
The Saipov defending team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Deputy says Nigel FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army” during a protest at the Conservative Conference.
The former U.K. Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics - as one of the Members of Theresa May suggested, he should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative Deputy Peter Bone said in Birmingham’s walk that the United Kingdom had already been released if Farage had been a secretary for Brexit.
But the dilemma Ms May faced to reconcile its deeply divided troops was emphasized by conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union who joined an isolated protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has difficulty maintaining his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay and from the EU.
The allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite hostilities – and would force Eurosceptics and Workers to choose between their program and the “chaos”.
Mr. Bone indicated at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He considered that Mr Farage should have become a partner and see the burden of negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have gone out,” he said.
Wellingborough said: “I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.”
He expressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not been delivered to world wars to submit ourselves.
We want to make our own legislation in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that the public opinion had evolved since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people turned the page and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also present during her walk to tell journalists: “I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers is not appreciated by the great public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who sill the streets and make us elect first of all.
Leave Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Ms May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their job when they obey their promises.
“Mr. Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be led to “sensitive pressure” if they were about to betray the decision that was taken as part of the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to deceive Brexit and we say to them today, “We will not let you get out of that way.”
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: “I wish you felt pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the country’s popular army that allowed us to win the victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists branded banners of conservatives against Brexit after the group launched this weekend.
His working homologus Lord Adonis laughed at conservatives due to security issues regarding the application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“They are the ones who assure us that they are able to set up computer systems and all technology for Canada, plus, for the friction-free border, for the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn’t exist,” he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider the possibility of presenting himself in presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider the possibility of attending presidential elections after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts Democrats discussed their future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice against President Donald Trump, appears for the reelection in November against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chairman in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the center of speculation that Trump could face in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in a public assembly since Trump’s office.
A participant asked him if he intended to present himself to the Presidency.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which implies having a woman in the head of the state.
Detention on the death of Sims from the State University of Louisiana
Saturday, Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced that a suspect was arrested in connection with the death of basketball player Wayde Sims, an LSU basketball player, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Service took part in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 HE.
Friday, they had published a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who figured on the images.
Sims, 20, was killed by ball on Friday morning, near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims was injured by a ball injury and sucked by her injuries," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde took his friend's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Asked, Simpson admitted to being in place, in possession of a gun, and shooting on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and warned at the police service of East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a 2 m young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, disputed 32 matches, 10 of which were starting last season, and totaled an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebonds per match.
Russia’s Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton turns to the world after the team’s guidelines allowed him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It has quickly become evident since Valtteri Bottas qualified as Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that Mercedes's team's commanders would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broke Hamilton on the side while defending his place in the first two tours, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to launch in the torment at the piloot's edge, which should have been a decisive element.
The Mercedes went through the stands later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver leaving the inner part at the risk of resisting after a double defence attempt in the third round.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race while maintaining his tyres to turn a speed arrival and move Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th tower, but was unable to accelerate the pace in the remaining eight towers, Raikkonen ranked fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and has been a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein, who emphasized that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate of sexual assault in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission, but he claimed that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "bad, disgusting and unfair."
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate in the last days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and unfair,” he said.
“When they saw the revelations and escapes, they say, ‘Oh, I did not.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... have you disclosed information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't disclosed anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... No, we haven’t disclosed information,” he added, thinking of the Senator’s impression.
Feinstein received last July the letter from Ford to describe the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early September, but Feinstein denied that the escape came from his office.
"I haven't dissimulated Dr. Ford's allegations, I haven't disclosed his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill said.
"She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked me."
But his denial seems not to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday evening at the meeting: “I will tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she hasn't done it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the president let the Democrats hear that Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see evil, mesquinerie, they wonder who they are injuring, who they have to break in to get power and control,” the president told Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars deleted their Friday defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by defeating the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants opened the score thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie have returned home equality before Dwyer returns the advantage to Giants.
François Bouchard equated for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen recorded two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the players of Adam Keefe, who had beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday evening in Belfast after being caught.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants who triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the post four minutes later.
During a first well-loaded period, Sullivan restarted the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt joined Cownie at 15:16, with an equation.
Dwyer assured the Giants' advance before the first pause when he hit his second goal of the evening to the end of the first period.
The local team gathered and Bouchard once again equated with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee in front of the match for the first time at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-way.
The Giants, now losing four of their last five matches, will welcome Milton Keynes in their next Friday match.
Air traffic controller died by assisting hundreds of people on board an airplane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is welcomed as hero after he died by ensuring that an airplane carrying hundreds of people can depart safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have been carried away after an important earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replies continue to ravage the region and a large number of people are captured under debris in the city of Palu.
But despite the escape of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the violently sealed tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could safely climb.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he felt she would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokeswoman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilised a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrives in Palu.
“Our heart is broken to learn this,” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the country's disaster prevention agency indicating that access to cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance will continue to sound as many bodies were still under the decays and many could not be rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu that will celebrate a mass funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide help and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings back bodies.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was snatched earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that a man has disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that manages the flight that collapsed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has disappeared after the 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the flying plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the person in question.
The airline has not immediately responded to requests for more precise information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships participated in the rescue of other passengers and crew after the aircraft hit the water by attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in the hospital, and they were all in a stable state.
The cause of the crash and the exact occurrence of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Some witnesses estimated that the plane had crossed the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had arrived too low.
“It’s a very good thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others had been able to fly into the water until the aircraft's rescue was running.
he claimed that the ship agents had panic and cried, and that he was suffering from a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy claimed that the sailors working near the improvement of a quay also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the farm before the plane flows in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died of airline accidents recorded in Papouasie-New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night when the woman was burnt alive
The accusation updated his case on Saturday during a man's trial accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described the jury how he used records of telephone calls past a mobile phone to track the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
Rowlett reported that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he claimed to meet his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared at the bar on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency lies in the fact that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The telephone records show that they’ve known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted SMS, Chambers' phone calls and coordinates.
"He removed it from his life," said Hale.
Defence must start its plagiarism on Sunday.
The judge said he was expecting the trial to be held before the jury during the day.
The High Breed: What is the political hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of the genre by impressing its music from positive messages.
The High Breed, Bristol, claims that the hip hop has been far from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurface in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
There's another black one?!
New York’s nine-year-old pursues a couple in court for dismissal after a racist text
A newborn in New York pursues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an error message from the mother who complained that it was "a more black."
The couple refuses to be racist, and assimilates prosecutions to a "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed her consternation by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nine, was Black at her arrival for her first working day.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE ONE NEAR,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a SMS.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding his gaffe, "bad to comfort," Plasco-Flaxman sent Maurice back, explaining to her that her former nine, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and she expected a Philippines.
Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues the couple in court to obtain compensation for her return and claims a $ 350 per day compensation for the six-month home service for which she was initially hired, but without a contract.
“I want to make them understand, listen, we don’t do such things,” she explained on Friday, adding “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the allegations of racism saying it was reasonable to stop Maurice’s use, fearing not to be able to trust him after he made the wrong.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
“We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone with whom you have been impoliated, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Let's see!"
Assimiling the trial to a “extortion,” Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months old to have a baby and was in a “very delicate situation.”
Would you pursue someone like that?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” added the business banker.
While the case is still in ongoing, the public opinion court did not hesitate to complain about the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s editors feared that readers wouldn’t identify themselves with a bear speaking, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: “It’s hard to put in place someone who read it for the first time before his publication.
It’s very fun, knowing what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a little pebble bear, would remain optimistic with the rejection of her work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a “small-amer” taste after her death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family,” and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a quiet man, and he was not a pretentious man,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds: we are proud of him, even if it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried everything to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to explain how bad the situation was, we didn’t expect it to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to warn me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given him to maintain their heart rate were slowly exhausting and leaving his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it.”
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, in the sadness of her daughter, went into the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the trial she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I experienced this immense sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Woman with sadness deposits postal cards to prevent suicide on the bridges.
Two women who have lost dear beings by suicide are trying to prevent others from leaving their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys displayed, on a bridge, postal cards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I’m forced to feel on the daily basis,” she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminated any room.”
However, he released his job before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, he was Tyler's brother, then 11-year-old, who found his brother again after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid there will be an effect of training.”
Ms. Davis created the maps “to tell people that there are people you can see and to whom you can talk, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t keep silence – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt kidnapped, depressed or otherwise,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw his attitude change.
He was at his lowest Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She stated that her death had been a huge trauma for them, but they have to get out of it: “It’s detrimental for the family.
It destroys us.
But we must all go ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh was launched while the FBI began its investigation.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked – a limited time, limited in his scope – we could probably bring a bit of unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would “break out” in a partisan breakdown.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-mandate elections will only take place within five weeks, that is, November 6, if, as expected, Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to make the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush dropped the phone to call the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met, through his wife Ashley, who was at the time his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to leave the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of deserters “fall” under Kim’s direction
The number of North Korean desertors to South Korea has declined since the rise in power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1, 127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs required by passengers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will finally be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee China, which shares the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreans.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often repatriates them in force.
The relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang as part of the negotiations focused on denuclearization negotiations that remained until then suspended.
This took place after the historical June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in large lines, to work in favour of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
Nevertheless, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday charged U.S. sanctions with no progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate a unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi qualified Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and claims he is unable to sit in the Supreme Court
Pelosi, the leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh of "hysterical" and said he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made these comments as part of an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t stop thinking that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have treated it as “hysterical,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Committee of the Judgment on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh became very emotional and sometimes failed to shout and excited by speaking to his family and years of high school.
In addition, he explicitly condemned the Democrats sitting in the committee, calling the allegations about a “grote and coordinated killing” organized by disappointed liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that according to her, Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unable to sit in the Supreme Court, as he showed that he was against Democrats.
"I think he discredits himself with these statements and how he took it to Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to destitute Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get the majority at the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also inappropriate to sit in the court where he is currently," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is judge at the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
During his hearings of confirmation of charges, Mr. Kavanaugh elected the question of the possible reverse of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time for a partial and hysterical person to go to court and to wait for what we said is ‘not wonderful’,” Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It is a legitimate diatribe that overcomes months and years of anger, and she can't get her out without crying.
“We cry when we are angry,” Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s rare, and you?”
“I was greatly assisted by a woman who was frame somewhere, who told me she was crying as well when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to when she was angry and crying: ‘You can think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an excuse to anger, partly because they are fundamentally incomprehensible.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in a men-dominated office, where I was once found crying out of an unexplained anger, was that I had been caught by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold director who had always been a little scared - who trained me in a scale.
“Don’t let them in any way see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They believe you sad and are happy because they have had you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Deputy of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential elections.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart was taken into a extramarriage case on board a ship called Monkey Business and left the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the Presidency.
“It wasn’t a maturely thoughtful decision,” she laughed, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other high school candidates, and the last thing they missed was one more person.
Someone called it “White Snow and the Seven Nains.”
As the campaign was very advanced, she had delayed in collecting funds, and thus swore that she would not participate at least in collecting $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who usually gave $1,000 to men counted to give her only $250.
“Do you think I have the right to a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so bored by her emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - that if she feels it, she feels so hard.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous depression," Mrs. Schroeder remembered about the press reaction to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the trade war between the United States and China could benefit from Beijing
The first rescues of the trade war between the United States and China have been shocking, and although the battle is far from ending, a long-term disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), thus paying half of all the goods coming from China to the United States.
Every time, Beijing has responded naturally, striking newly from 5 to 10 per cent to 60 billion dollars of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to equate the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will soon fall.
To get back to Washington, it is to cede to the requirements, but to cede publicly before the United States would be too embarrassing to Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role correctly, pressures from U.S. trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can set conditions favorable to economic slowdown in one or another of the countries is far more dangerous than the observers have previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security reflection group.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country would improve.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now fulfilled for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and means of living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have deserted the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid to reconstruction of this devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional or aid from the countries that would stop the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European ground and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the title when Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the bar of 14.5 points necessary to fight the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who found himself in difficulty during most of the tournament, hit his departure in the water at the 16th hole in par-3, ceding his duel to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players ever reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which comes back in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was deprived of 5 to 4 by the least well-placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, played 2 and 1 face with the English Ian Poulter, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Coupes, the Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t cry, but today it’s stronger than I am.
It was a moving year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help him," Garcia emotionally confessed after European victory.
He passed the flame to his compatriot John Ram who defeated the legend of the American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
“I feel an incredible pride, I have beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy,” said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the biggest golfers of all time, who scored 14 major titles just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been hard to find fairways all weekends, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance on his team: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we had a certain moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We abandoned.
The hat to Thomas.
He's a big captain.
