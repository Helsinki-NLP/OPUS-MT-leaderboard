The well-made caves in the forests in New Bora were not actually inhabited
In the north of the Czech Republic in the underground of the Luz Mountains, close to New Bora on the Czechoslovakia, in the forests led by the Hraběči Road, there are several sandy rock departments hiding.
Natural and artificially created.
And we're going to be behind the human hand created.
The place is called the cave at the pedestrian.
In fact, however, there has never been a shelter and the cave served as a hiding, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently on the grain.
The cave is tied from the side to the rock carefully and accessible on the stairs upwards.
However, it is practically not seen until the last moment.
It will spread to the narrow stairs leading to some rock gallery, from where it just enters the rocks.
Although it appears that the room is far from human habitats, at the time of creation it could be on the upper surface, where there is today a forest field.
“The fact that this building has no window and is located in a traditional place clearly shows that no castle could ever survive the winter,” explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Purkyna, in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone layer behind which apparently serves for the deforestation of containers.
"I see it as a chamber to store some food or field products," Kamil Podroužek adds.
On the walls of the cave there are traces of tools.
The deflation of the sandstone was quite simple and fast for the dedicated.
Sufficient to properly use the snakes and gradually delay the sand.
Depending on the length of the trail after the top and the way of secking, it is possible to determine the period of the formation of the cave.
According to history, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible, and according to the irregularity that appears in it, there is somebody sometimes resting in today’s times.
If you approach the cave upstairs from one of the forest roads and get under the cave running walks and close to the cruise road, then you will certainly find the downstairs path as well.
And by the way of the forest, you may still be captured near the Havrean rocks.
Zhoke Minarik is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Filip is in the best hand now.
Fortunately, we have a part of our family in Hannover.
This greatly facilitates the situation and also care for the daughter of Finju," said the Jezdci.cz server in a statement by Minarik's wife Katji.
"Everyone is doing the best, Philip now needs time to recover.
It makes no sense to give any predictions.
Anyone who has ever met with the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all need to be patient now and give him time," said a 45-year-old boy.
To support the injured Minaric, he called on Twitter as well as the star Frankie Dettori, who won the Ascot winners of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on Saturday, which was the same as Lester Piggott legend.
On the Gofundme server, nearly €70,000 has been chosen today.
The goal is €100,000 (2.6 million crowns).
Video decision-maker took four goals to footballers Sassuola, lost 0:2
The footballers Sassuola scored the ball four times in the opponent's gate at the Saturday match in Naples, but finally had to deal with the defeat 0:2.
No one of their goals was known by the arbitrator after consulting the video for the Office.
According to the Italian media, this is a record technology breakthrough, so many interventions have never been defeated by one team.
"VAR was more strict than the road radar on Sassuolo and punished him as no team yet.
The new technology holds records," said Gazzetta dello Sport.
"The festival of unknown Sassuola goals.
“VAR has never been so strict to one team before,” added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday at 8 a.m., but after half an hour of the game, Sassuolo seemed to be corrected.
Gol Filip Djuričiče was not recognized after the video-decisive intervention due to the office.
For the same reason, Djuričić's intervention and tricks of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi did not pay gradually.
On the contrary, the homes added another goal.
Electric cars announce a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most has happened in history.
"The growth has been about 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations as well as the accelerated development of the registration of new e-autos," said Tomáš Chmelík, Chief of Clean Technology Service.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car manufacturers, as well as Bill’s and Lidl’s supermarkets.
The operators of classical pump stations are again represented by MOL.
But she hasn't had the numbers yet.
"Our network for electric mobility has only begun to build a tray," said Jan Juskov, spokesman of the company.
However, the editing of the Deníku received exclusive data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It shows that drivers from the station took an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the arrival of approximately a hundred kilometers of smaller electric car.
If we forget the small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average load takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of tanks were then held at a free rate.
If the drivers were already paid for the purchase, their typical loss was around 330 crowns.
Electricity is mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of ČEZ’s most challenging cargoes, which cover their popularity as well as the entire rural cities.
Among the regions is Olomouc.
On the contrary, the smallest interest is the remote stations in the border, such as in Godumina or in Works, which often remain throughout the day without use.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year, there were 1274 new e-auts.
In a wide survey of Denik, eight percent of readers said that the purchase of electric cars in the family is considering.
Only one-third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their surroundings.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protest in Prague
According to the organizers, the current government steps in protecting and curing the Czech country and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, spokespersons have called for a state to get more distractional approach.
Actions called Last drop took part by representatives of large organizations such as the Movement of the Spirit, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local alliances.
"We have people here, for example, who are long-standing anti-expansion down Turów; there are people who are anti-expansion of the turtle mining at the Hungarian Island; there are people who are anti-building of meaningless turtle mining," said Marika Volf.
She said that the main demands for protesters are to create a landscape water retention plan, a remarkable change in agricultural policy and a grant system to support sustainable agriculture and as fast as possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend the interests of people, not a devastating and devastating business," she said.
A tent with petitions was placed on the Malostrans Square, calling on the representatives of the Czech State to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the renewal of the Czech soil and landscapes.
The people present were equipped with transparencies with passwords such as "The End of the Ripple Depot" or "My Min Carbon, More Shoes".
From the southern Moravia to Prague, Jan Škoda arrived from the Za water for people who protested against the plan of the Hodonian slaughterhouse mining.
“It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people,” he said.
He added that the drills are the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned mining of the scratch is only 500 meters away from the hills, and it is estimated that the quality of the water will be threatened.
For so-called agroecological farmers, he came from the village of Valeč to Karlovarska Vojtěch Veselý.
He warned the bets of small farms that are unexpected for income and profits and supply the inhabitants directly on site.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population normally, but they do not make such a destruction in the form of rural and environmental," he said.
Three people died in the fall of a plane at home in Germany
At the fall of an ultra-light plane to an apartment house in western Germany, three people died today and two others were injured.
They informed local rescue components that there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house among the dead.

The third victim is a woman who lives in the house.
The newspaper Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) with an appeal to the Mayor of Weselu wrote that it was the mother of a survivor whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with mild injuries.
Near the crash was found an emergency crash, which probably served as a landing brake.
Police are based on the fact that they come from an airplane.
There was a place for two people on the plane.
The machine started from the nearby Marl airport.
The Rheinische Post, with an appeal to the obvious witnesses, said that before the crash, the plane collapsed with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, referring to other witnesses, wrote that the plane dropped in the air before the earth’s impact.

We are working on this together with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics,” Vojtěch said.
This is the so-called semafore, the individual regions will be labeled with green, orange or red colors according to the risk of coronavirus occurrence.

The course of most disease is mild, only 3% of infected people have to go to the hospital.
Both with the Czech Republic, the mildest form of the coronavirus spreads, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious hospitals are semi-vacuous, although the numbers of infected people are growing.
"This situation is completely different today and in April, and it is given mainly by the number of hospitalized," said Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth reminding that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic occurred with us, they weared all of the trousers, the army was carried out, the Republic was closed, and the Czech Republic consumed disinfections for a year in advance.
Ten people die every day.
Today, the daily increase in the number of infected people is higher, but every day with COVID-19, up to two people die.
The highest number of infected per population still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava because of a fire in the local Alzheimer’s Center, where 57 infected are already - 40 customers and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors closed hygiene in Černožice at Kralováhradecka.
The tests were confirmed in one of the nurses.
“We trace, limit movement, we have all hygiene measures,” said Martin Scháněl, retiree home director.
According to him, none of the customers of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
Plain tests will begin to perform hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.

Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh's story, Anderson Smetl
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh presented excellent performance in the fight against the player, which the second most prestigious PDC company won in 2018.
The introduction of the match was two-sidedly balanced, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian shipper.
Van den Bergh took a 13-speed legum and had a design since then.
His opponent literally drew his game and had a much more experienced "Flighting Scot" just had difficulty reaching the ducks.
The way he had "The Creator of Dreams" in his cheerfulness, it also proves that the vast Anderson played his first maximum up to the 24th league.
In addition, a young Belgian managed great high checkouts.
Lastly, he lost in the 11th league, in a disadvantaged state but "capped a large fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson saw a huge frustration.
Instead, he just threw up the hills, and behind his triumph, his pedestrian opponent acted entirely sovereignly.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of three matches and reached his name - wrote his big dream.
The gain of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable for the Belgian chips that it is his first winning major.
The last player who managed to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes, the cathedral has been charged with fire, a man has admitted himself
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday, and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th-century vitrage windows and destroyed the valleys.
The suspects of the blast were investigated by the investigators because the fire proceeded to the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no signs that someone would get into the cathedral with violence.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diecez, a nine-year-old Rwanda refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now, the prosecutor informed that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, admitted and faced the accusations of crash.
In case he is found guilty, he is in danger of up to ten years of jail and a high punishment.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to work with the investigators in full, Le Monde wrote.
We will introduce "semafor" for epidemiological measures on Monday
The new system is to fulfill the role of the pandemic plan, which causes the absence of the government and the health ministry of criticism.
"They will only be according to the power of community dissemination," said the minister.
He added that, for example, the Moravskoslez Kraj or Prague would now reach a middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional because the situation in each region is significantly different.
On the system, the Ministry has worked with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be imposed at each level, whether it is the obligation to wear shoes or to organize special departments in hospitals.
In order to create an epidemiological plan in the TV series Prima Partie, Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (CSR) has called upon that people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation deteriorates.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has risen in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Military commented this by not saying that there is no critical incident on the spot to talk about the declaration of an emergency or the re-appelation of the crisis state.
With regard to the growing number of infected people in the Czech Republic since Saturday, the government has again imposed the obligation to wear suitcases on internal actions of more than 100 people.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now about 1000 people.
The government’s procedure, when it was not clear until the last moment, what measures and when it will be announced, was criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively stressed, the main factors should create a sense of certainty on the contrary and the confusion on the contrary," said Senator Marek Hilscher in the Questions.
Measures can now vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday, the obligation to wear wardrobes is also applicable in non-resident medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or in doctor’s waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear wardrobes when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday in the Liberian and Ústic region.
It is necessary to wear wardrobes in internal public spaces, MHDs and medical facilities since July 14.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures were released in the Moravskoslezka region as well as in the Central Region of Kutnohorska.
The Czech government has also approved the so-called summit for Europe at the beginning of June, which colorfully distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and, consequently, adjusts the rules for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For countries with low and moderate risks, the authorities do not require a negative test on the coronavirus or quarantine for Czech citizens from June 15.
They are mandatory when the Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are in a low-risk category.
Technoparty continues in Benešovska.
Playing on a third capacity, it had to end in the afternoon.
The Technoparty of Hlaváky Lhota (Benešovsko) at Hlaváky Lhota on Benešovsko also continues on Sunday evening.
One-third of the 12 original music systems are still playing.
According to evening estimated police after 20:00, approximately 500 people remain here, the original gross estimated three hundred, the morning was at 900, police spokesman Lucie Novákov said.
The technoparty originally had to end on Sunday afternoon, while some of the music systems were really quiet at that time.
“Some have gone and others have gone.
Music production is still in part.
We are expecting a gradual disconnection and disruption of music systems,” Nováková said.
"Policians are still steadfastly controlling departing visitors to prevent driving drivers under the influence of alcohol or habits.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before departure,” he added.
Dozens of police officers are supervised on the action, foreign police, transport and order police are in place, and there are also dogs with service dogs in preparation.
"During this day, police checked 470 people moving at the site of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were tested, six of which were seated behind the wheelchair under the influence of alcohol," Novákov said.
A total of 95 police drivers tested the presence of abnormal and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also addressed 14 traffic crimes.
At the request of participants, the technoparty police have conducted 300 preventive respiratory tests and four preventive tests for the presence of obsessive and psychotrope substances.
There were about 2,000 people in the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would attack there.
In the television series Prima Partie said that by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
However, the number of participants decreased below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and they did not even ask for a hygiene station or the Ministry of Health.
The Czech TV (ČT) said on Sunday that the technoparts expanded to the surrounding lands, whose owners did not agree with the use of the technoparts.
It is possible that the owners of the neighbouring lands will request damages.
The supporters of the tech on the field at Hlaváčaka Lhoty arrived on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the field in Blažima in Benešovska, where the technoparty took place last year.
It is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkova Lhota, where the technicians were finally sitting.
According to the New York Times, no one has arrived.
The snake’s defeat: the girl ended in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Iceland.
It turns into the leg of the girl, 2010, which her parents brought to the base of rescue service themselves," said the spokesman of the health care service Mária Svobodova, who later transferred the child to the hospital in Klatov.
The snake is the only poisonous cattle in the Czech Republic, and just in the Shumava, these animals are present in a higher number, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the snake will remove you is not too high, when normal contact is afraid of yourself.
And if he has a space for that, he likes to go away for a loud welding.
It only attacks if it feels a lot threatened - for example, if you're wrong with it.
However, her removal is not a tragedy, but her poison is very effective against small ants, but people do not die.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk is, therefore, mainly in children, seniors and allergies.
“A person has often a feeling of vomiting, dizziness, an increase in temperature, swelling, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, in weakened individuals, and especially allergic, can occur until anaphylactic shock,” said Miriam Gredov from the Klatov Hospital.
The man threatened to get the babies out of the window.
After a policeman lil wine with a bowl
After 23 a.m., the intervention unit entered the apartment and the men were arrested.
The kidnappers were immediately taken to health care, stated in a press release by country police spokeswoman Markéta Janovska.
The man didn't want to work with the police, after the police negotiator, he threw the dishes, knives, or waste them from the wine window.
He strengthened his threats several times during the negotiations by shaking with the child in his arms from the window.
He even went out to the parapet of the window, where he returned.
Police are still investigating the man.
You don’t want to publish more information yet.

Sapa Markets: Razie reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles in the area transported 1320 pieces of chicken eggs of unknown origin, in addition under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be eliminated in the assault plant,” the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the live fish staircase, it was then found that the seller has no evidence of origin of goods and is not registered for sale of live fish.
The market is considered a veterinary problem for a long time.
For example, last autumn, the veterinarian revealed the illegal food store, with nearly half a ton of unlabelled foods without evidence of origin.
In most cases, the date of consumption was not found, some of the products had a last duration and were damaged.
For five kilograms of sepsis, the date of duration was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with police in the market area held 80 kilograms of food without evidence of origin, including dry fish, oil or frozen cabins, while some of them were dancing.
Putin calls Zelensky before the launch of a Donbass attack, the Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke telephonely to his Ukrainian opponent Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where he is going to start paying new seats from midnight.
Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament’s decision to take place in local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On the new peace of mind, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on Wednesday night to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OECD).
The target is to begin after midnight on Monday night, to be "complete and general" and to open the way to comply with other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in an interview with Zelensk that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to organize local elections is opposed to the Minsk peace agreement and threatens prospects for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the elections to local representatives would not take place in the territory of the pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will be back in control of the Ukrainian occupied separatists with Russia after providing these regions with broad autonomy and organizing local elections here.
The Green Office, according to the Union Agency, stated that both citizens agreed to the benefit of the upcoming landing in Donbas and to the need to take further measures to support peace in the region, such as the denial of combat areas or the withdrawal of parts of the front units.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop fighting, but on both sides of the front people continue to die in occasion of occasional shootings and fire attacks.
The Donbass conflict has been demanding more than 14,000 deaths since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support of separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made his priority in the end of the Donbass war, but it has not yet reached a more important role in negotiations.
The unexpected master in the tenboy was Rykl, sevenboy ruled Novotná
The defender of the last two titles Dolegal did not achieve the end of the Saturday four-square program, Kopecký did not jump the base in the shirt on Sunday.
A decade ago, the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the group of Josef Karase, has resigned after the album.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outer MČR so far, this time he was the only tenth player to reach the seven thousand borders.
Another medal after him was William Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl reminded Adam Sebastian Helcel and Jiří Sykory of absence.
“Unfortunately there were no boys here and Kope didn’t set up because the results would look completely different.
But the title is very tasteful, especially I appreciate that I have given a person 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the bag and I was most disappointed by the disk, I was under average there," he admitted on Facebook.
On the first day of the week, Katerina Cach won with more than a hundred conquest, although she was injured by a wounded cat on a reflective leg.
In the remote sector, however, it was only 570 cm, it did not pass 40 meters and it did not go up to the final eighth.
It collected 5878 points and won 241 points in front of Katerina Dvořák.
It’s mainly far away, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I wanted it to be around the 630.
“Yesterday I started to taste, but I’m so glad that I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotná said on Facebook.
Bio LPG arrives in Czech Republic, promising ecological operation
The LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or oil, a significantly lower consumption tax given, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer captured.
Like petrol and oil, it also has its ecologically friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, this is a whole news - the European market first appeared and the Czech LPG arrived in Czech Republic a few days ago.
"In these days, we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping stations in combination with the classical LPG," the Primagas Association of Jiří Karlík said.
Bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biofuel.
According to the association, on the chemical side, it is consistent with the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now tank in their cars.
Therefore, both versions can be mixed either way.
"The only difference between classical LPG is the way of production," says Ivan Indraček, the president of the association.
This is one of the major benefits of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, for example, compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a side-product in the production of bioetanol from food residues and sugar potatoes.
In the future, it should be produced targeted, such as cellulose biomass, i.e. wooden waste.
In contrast, the classic oil LPG is partially produced as a side-product in refining oil, partially separation in natural gas mining.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the bio-LPG operations of the car, it is 40-70% more ecologically friendly in terms of carbon traces than oil LPG operations and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from car emissions, but rather about the fuel production ecology, which is the so-called "well-to-tank" part (something "from the source to the tank").
One of the largest bio manufacturers is the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Pure Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol also explores the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles are driven per LPG; the Ministry of Environment indicates a slightly higher number in the NAP ČM, about 200 thousand.
According to the Ministry of Transport statistics, nearly 6,000 LPG car transfers were carried out last year.
The LPG is available in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of different operators.
Soldiers reviewed the number of infected people, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, has ordered the ministry to review the numbers of infected with the coronavirus.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon declined from 5254 to 3479 cases, which is less than 1775 infected.
Currently, there are 3422 sick in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump increase in the number of healed ones, there is a review of data that have not been able to update hygiene recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of medical statistics.
Until Sunday afternoon in the Czech Republic 15,212 people were infected with coronavirus, 11,419 were healed and 371 Covid-19 diseases were unfortunately affected.
Mobile Election Units or Correspondence Elections.
Politicians and sociologists are looking for variants for the period of the pandemic
In order to allow people in quarantine to vote in the October country and Senate elections because of the coronavirus, a change in law is required, according to the Vice-Premier and Interior Minister Jana Hamáčka (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or in September in an accelerated regime.
He announced it on Sunday at the Prima TV party.
He wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties in the ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, that will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamaček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution under applicable law rules.
However, the Minister said it would be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine could not vote because of their health condition.
The ban on voting should remain, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the possibility of correspondence election has been delayed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in Parliament, then counts on its introduction to voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or CSD (because, according to experience abroad, it would rather be recorded by other types of parties) from the correspondence election as over-evaluated.
In particular, it is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Climam said that it is now necessary to ad hoc invent mechanisms (options) that could be carried out this year and with the lowest possible health risk.
It is then considered to be prepared for 2021 when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
A correspondence choice (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As a further one, they see the above elections or the possibility of a representative vote within the family.
He added that there is a possibility to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of the coronavirus - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infections, various types of elections have been delayed this year in 67 countries worldwide.
Protests in Bulgaria: Prasechi ears thrown protesters into government building
Participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov and his cabinet have put pig ears on the building of the government.
It was a series of protests against the "mafia style of rule" that have been held in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a national blockade in the middle, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which took place on the 18th day after it, had a weaker participation, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom station.
At 20:00 there were about 300 people, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
The demonstrators in front of the building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically closed into the prison cells of Prime Minister Boris and prosecutor-general Ivan Gešev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the President of the Government.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the Protestants.
They also requested the cancellation of the reported health reform and the end of corruption in the construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of protests, Nikolaj Hadžigenov, said in public broadcasting that on Wednesday, the "top of escalation" will be prepared in the form of "the international manifestations in Sofia and the blockade across the country".
He repeated the request for the resignation of Boris and his government, as well as writing early elections.
They should take place in March 2021.
Borisov said he was unpleasant to resign.
It justified, among other things, the need to carry out Bulgaria's COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he exchanged five members of his government team to stop the protester’s resignation.
At the beginning of this week, Boris's government stopped voting on confidence in the parliament.
Coach Boloni Mikhailovič no longer wants games without viewers
Boloni football coach Siniša Mihajlovič already has enough matches from the Italian League without viewers.
He hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
“What we’re currently doing here is not football.
I've got teeth full of matches without viewers.
It's a great football, it doesn't bring me any emotions, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mihailovich said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, the series A matches follow in a quick track, and although they are played until evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible bow.
Under such conditions, they don’t even know how the teams are on that.
That's the end of this season.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope that fans will be back since September," the coach, who had previously led both Fiorentino and AC Milan, said.
For Mikhailoviče, this season is unusual even because it was missing for four months on the liver because of leukemia.
"In spite of my disease, the interruption of the league, and all the others were able to move our team to a higher level.
“We want to continue to grow and we need to make players mentally stronger,” he said.
“We have become a burden to the cyberattack of foreign countries,” Iran says.
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a series of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear equipment, as well as oil refineries, plants, factories and companies.
Some Iranian agents stated that the fire that broke this month in underground nuclear operation in NATO could cause cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iran’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Abbás Musávi told Iranian media that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure faces “thousands of cyberattacks” daily.
He added that it is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to resist.
In recent months, a number of broader cyber attacks have been recorded, according to Musávi, which according to the analysis of "determined governments and groups."
However, more details of possible criminals have not been reported, according to Reuters.
Musava also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An Iranian state agency IRNA said this month that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could stand behind recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States suspended diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and 444 days held 52 Americans.
Long-term tensions between the two countries increased in 2018 after Washington resigned from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a strong impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. army killed Iranian general Kasama Soleiman and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militia Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
On January 8th, Iran fired the number of missiles to bases in Iraq, where Americans operate.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel considers Iran as its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main supporter of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran refuses.
The TPCA car extended production suspension, now until May 25.
The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has renewed its production ceasefire due to the coronavirus.
The production lines should be restarted on Monday, May 25.
The story is accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said car spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
The production is due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company initially planned to restore it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the withdrawal is that, according to Paroubka, the boundaries are closed and the dealership is closed, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two exchanges.
Koronavirus is affected by key companies markets, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
The oldest Michael Kašpar (Change for Colin) said that TPCA’s ceasefire was not recorded for life in the city.
From the beginning it was known, it was empty in the city.
But the streets are gradually filled, especially since Monday, when it has been a lot of fun.
“The city is full,” Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with foreign workers who stayed at the hostels.
"In those two months, we had to solve almost no problem," Kašpar said.
For example, the young adolescent Škoda Auto, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, restored it on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither of the race works at 100% of the capacity.
The restoration of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night, a night exchange, was held in Mladé Boleslavi and Kvasinách for the first time after the renovation of the production.
At TPCA, approximately 2,500 people are currently employed and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employers in Colombia.

For more than two years she fought against cancer, Gemma Sisson, and when she seemed to have been defeated by cancer, the disease was called again.
A ninety-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, finally ended up bed in a hospital where she still had to take her life love.
Unfortunately, the uncle was undergoing.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her social media account on Facebook.
Gemma Sisson, originating in English Leeds, loved bodybuilding.
With his friend Ricky Moor, who lived with more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
A ninety-year-old woman was athlete and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope that he would be healed.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to be able to win over cancer, but in August 2019, cancer returned and this time the spine was attacked.
The bodybuilder and personal coach, according to the British newspaper Daily Mirror, had undergone a 10-hour spinal surgery and subsequently restarted drastic treatment.
But everything was lost.
At the beginning of this year, at her ninety-first birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months of life.
In April, a glamorous blonde finally decided to go to a hospital in Leeds, where her family visited her at any moment, even organizing her a wedding with her love Ricky.
Marriage took two months.
Ricky took Gemmu to the restaurant for the last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after his death on her social media account, Gema wrote a post for her family.
“If this was published, it means I finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough to be on my side all the time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network that pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I received from all my social media followers,” she wrote with the fact that everyone should appreciate their lives and live it fully.

The healthcare wages will increase by up to 5 per cent next year.
Increased increases are unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Wages in healthcare could increase by up to 5 per cent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (ANO) in Václava Moravce’s Questions on Czech TV.
The demand for up to 15% increase is considered unreal.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
The hospitals now have their stocks.
“I think the increase in payments may be up to five percent somewhere,” the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation in which, since March, the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its dissemination have been affected.
Insured incomes declined at that time.
"Over 15 per cent increases will come to me at this time unreal," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly salary of a doctor in acute bed care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, nurses 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the wages of sisters in state hospitals and the wages of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
UZIS also reports that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019, according to the data of the Czech Statistical Office, was 34,125 krone.
Representatives of trade unions said in June 2021 they would require a minimum increase of 10 per cent, ideally by 15 per cent.
They criticize a long-term significant difference between the salary of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by paytables, and contractual wages in cities, country or private hospitals.
They also require that the wage tables be consistent for healthcare professionals.
This year, the difference in nurses will reach up to seven thousand crowns a month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should see what the state is currently doing.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state deficit to recording 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion will be paid to healthcare providers in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Healthcare Providers according to Šmucler with a flat wage increase next year does not agree.
According to him, the hospitals themselves should decide on remuneration, and the healthcare facilities and the money should also go to them through the remuneration declaration.
He also said that the hospitals are currently providing enough protection.
Paul Švagr, Chairman of the State Department of Physical Reserves (SSHR), said this week that the administration currently has no assets or health care assistance.
Waiting for the completion of the selection procedure.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were purchased.
The state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Driving smart quarantine could be taken by soldiers.
We are ready, they report
“Smart quarantine works, of course, is what to improve.
We will discuss this with the army tonight.
The army works perfectly and it is the question whether they shouldn’t run it all again again,” the government’s president said on Facebook.
According to him, IT systems and hygiene stations are not able to connect enough, which must gradually move to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister in the Moravskoslezka region, where they are one of the current fires of the epidemic.
Jan Pejšek, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Defense for the Czech Republic, said that there is no information about the Sunday negotiations and that the government should negotiate the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The Smart Quarantine Project was taken by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a ninety-year-old central management team established under the army as an advisory authority of the government, led by the former Prime Minister, Roman Prymula.
The second project on Sunday was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He also said that the army could take him back.
The disadvantages in the project were previously approved by government officials for IT and digitalization, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is concerned about it.
"The system works, but it is still working on it.
Twenty years have come up separately and non-systemically, now we are trying to unite it within a few months.
It's not a trick.
"People in the walk, poor in the hygiene in the walk adapt these new systems and actually capture those mistakes," he said.
Ostrav Prime Minister Macura won’t be nominated again, because he doesn’t want to “go in politics”
Current Prime Minister Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not be nominated in the next municipal elections.
The reason is that the attempt to "unbelieve in politics," said Respect.cz to the server.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO Movement, has been the prime minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he won nearly one-third of the voting votes by the ANO Movement candidate in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in the function for only four years.
"I said I'd be able to endure one functioning period and, with the experience of business, I'd be able to rebuild everything here for that time," Respectu said.
He added that for the second election period he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent.
“But for me it’s the maximum.
“I don’t want to fool myself in politics,” Macura added, who in an interview called himself a heavy introvert that does not fit frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, it has been speculating for a long time about the Macuro's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server reminds Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for the alliance with the SPD movement or for the support of Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few characters, ANO supported Zeman's opposition candidate Jiří Drahosh in the elections.
From the ANO movement to which he entered in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a totally boring fight and that nobody's missing me, I don't have an immediate motive to end," Respectu said.
The sixty-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the Ostrov Prime Minister in 2014, Macura worked among other things as the director of the pharmaceutical manufacturer of Walmark.
He also worked in other companies.
Uber returns to Brno, offering transportation services
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, which offers transportation services.
This is the result of the amendment to the law, he announced on Thursday in the press release of the Brno Council for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, changes to the law have changed since July the conditions for the operation of regular taxis and alternatives.
In the last few weeks, he has held several negotiations with Uber’s representatives.
"On their basis, this company decided to return with its services to Brno at the end of July this year.
This step is the consequence of a change in the law that allows the legal operation of this company.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given boundaries,” Kratochvíl said.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because of the lack of cars as a taxi or missing a taxi meter.
The court issued preliminary measures banning Uber to drive in the city.
Brno was originally supported by taxi drivers at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He is now returning on the basis of amendment to the law.
Since July, there is an easy operation of the transport service alongside the classic taxi with a light and a taximeter, ordered and paid exclusively via mobile apps.
Too buzzy celebration in Brno: the flying chairs hit a man's foot on the hillside
From the fourth floor of the apartment, she flew out in Brno on Saturday night and hit about a meter from the pedestrian.
After him, a walker who immediately called the officers.
The guard immediately after arriving to the address indicated in the western part of the city noticed an open window, under which the chairs were still lying, and next to it were several buckets and noises.
"The movement that was carried out from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a fairly noisy celebration takes place inside.

Request for Rafa's appeal to Grandma with the Czech Republic
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans on Monday with coalition social Democrats to discuss a request to appeal the Chief of the Anti-Monopoly Office (UOHS) Petra Rafaje.
Rafa has been called for non-profit organizations to negotiate the anti-corruption Council of Government and also the Ústeki kraj.
Social Democrats say that the exchange in the head of the office is in place.
According to reports, the CTK Rafaj was not invited to the government office on Monday.
The second mandate will end him in the middle of the next year, according to the law cannot be nominated by the third time.
His appeal is under the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenges of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar requirement from the Utrecht country.
The reason to be, among other things, Rafa's last case.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to express his request with the fact that he was familiar with the materials and the government parties took "no opinion".
He also stated that the challenge has not yet been discussed with the president, and that the meeting with him has not been negotiated in the near future.
According to ÚOHS, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not accused of anything.
IHNED.cz and Aktualmente.cz servers wrote last week that the police were interested in Rafa’s meetings with the heightman Jirik Čun.
The meetings included, among other things, the decision-making of the contest for the project of a controversial new liner hospital for eight billion, which Čunek hardly promotes.
The son of the meeting admitted, according to him, he was discussed together his "senate activities".
It is the same with Rafa.
At the end of June, the Usteckie Region’s representatives called on the government to appeal Rafa.
He also asks for a reform of the Authority’s decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the UOHS on public procurement by the Hejtman Municipality for transport Jaroslava Komínka is not transparent and has signs of injury.
In March, the police intervened in the anti-monopoly office due to a tender for the choice of a myth.
In June this year, the server Aktualmente.cz noted that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of an influential SSD player Alexandra Čuby.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Competition Protection Office was Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second period of office, the President of the former Member of Social Democracy was appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year mandate will expire.
The anti-monopoly law states that the president may appeal to the president of the office on the proposal of the government.
It may be withdrawn only if it does not perform a function for more than six months or seriously disturbs the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library, the employees collaborated warmly.
It helps air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
“It’s a good news for me.
We and three children go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
There was a terrible and bad air.
Winding couldn't help.
That’s why I’m pleased with air conditioning,” said one of the Blanen readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library of Lucas Dlapy, the temperatures in the building often sprout up to thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the object is shiny and functions as a greenhouse in sunny days.
In addition, the sun rises in it thanks to the curve of the building, and a large portion of the day.
At the same time, a major problem is to ventilate the individual department, because the window must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have this from morning to morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst was the studio and dictionary on the third floor.
And on the top floor then the exhibition room and the director.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department located under the roof of the building.
“It has happened several times that the librarians have collaborated and ended up working in disability.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures that dozens of people visit.
After a few minutes, there was no breathing," she said.
Initially, the city’s representatives wanted to make air conditioning this year in all areas of the library.
In the end, there will be only three rounds out of five.
“Due to limited financing, air conditioning will only have the most difficult spaces.
Study and dictionary on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department are upstairs," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blaine Investment Committee.
In the first phase last autumn, workers installed air engineering in the above-mentioned spaces and adjusted the electricity installation.

Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete gets out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to a NHL player who is silent about the health of the players and does not reveal anything at all.
As one of the few came out of the Crawford series.
A fifteen-year-old born from Montreal was present only in the first training since then, he was missing in the building.
"I would like to tell you all that I have been positively tested on Covid-19 and that's why I've spent the last fourteen days closed in my home," he said.
Fans don’t have to worry about their health anymore.
Crawford is ready to get back to full load.
“It’s amazing that I’m back.
I will do my best to get into the form as soon as possible," he added.

Thousands of people protest in Israel against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dealing with the coronary crisis.
The manifestations took place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in the park in Tel Aviv.
Protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants demand Netanyahu’s resignation for the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also for how the government addresses another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the demonstrators wrote to his transparency, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known surname.
"Everyone sees that the Emperor has lost his clothes," he said.
Netanyahu, seventy-year-old, is Israel's first prime minister to be executed.
He is accused of three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
All charges reject and designate them as a witch.
According to local media, the process can take up to three years, and more than 300 witnesses are called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Israel, with approximately nine million inhabitants, by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people died in connection with the infection.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases of infected people.
After the gradual release of restrictions since the end of April, the number of infected people again began to grow significantly, especially in the end of June.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not assisted, for example, livestock affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters also mislead the fact that the government in the fight against the coronavirus issued points of contradiction.
The driver broke the car on the tree and died.
The body had to cut the hammers out of the neck
The tragic accident occurred at Neveklov at around 23 hours in the narrow districts leading from the Slavic prefecture.
The driver, apparently, flew down to the forest at a low speed and broke the car around the tree.
He died on the spot.

Pietro Filipi breaks discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and leads to a substantial change in the strategy.
They disrupt discounts and no longer want to cut one collection behind the other.
The fact that fashion industry is one of the largest environmental pollutants is no news.
There are billions of clothes in the combustion halls and in the treasures each year.
Looking at slow fashion, often rejected approach to clothing, but has changed relatively quickly over the past few years.
About half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at a full price.
The second half that I sold thanks to discounts is simply not buying.
The company does not want to cut one collection for the second and at the end of each season the products are lowered by their production price.
In addition, according to owner Michael Mička, the eras of new and old collections and blind follow-up are rapidly changing fashion trends.
"Most dealers with discounts are already counted when buying goods, so in full price is included a much higher margin.
This is a little bit of fraud," says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses.
“Every product is made of carefully selected quality substances and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that much of our collection is made up of the so-called basic pieces - that is, clothing that is pre-time and seasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply matches its quality and the discount is not necessary,” adds Mička.
A huge graffiti represents the RAF flight of Kurt Taussig
“The mission was to create something to the end of the anniversary of the war.
And I remember our hunter pilot who fought in the British Royal Air Force series in World War II.
The design of the city’s leadership liked,” said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive creation.
He used about 300 liters of color and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplices-Shanov.
He left the city when he was 15 years old.
Due to his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him into an international camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton’s organization, he and his brother were able to avoid the concentration camp.

The Hanna storm arrives on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon of local time (ahead of SELČ at night tonight) arrived on the southwest coast of the state of Texas.
The Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the city of Port Mansfield, attacked while moving over the fortress of the tropical storm.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger for coastal areas.
It brought strong winds and intense precipitations; along with local floods, electricity accidents and various material damages have been reported, according to AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a state of natural disaster for 32 districts in Southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended volunteer evacuation.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastline between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total he lived to strike the territory of nearly 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over the northeast of Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, levels rising, dangerous collision and a single tournament can pose a threat," the National Hurricane Center warned.
This morning the local time (powder SELČ) storm moved to the U.S.-Mexican border area and accompanied it at a speed of 85 km/h.
Hanna became the first hurricane season in the Atlantic region on Saturday.
Over the Mexican Gulf it was driven by a wind speed of up to 145 km/h, but it gradually dropped to up to 112 km/h when it went to the fortress, which once again dropped Hannah out of the category of hurricanes.
The local authorities urged the storms to cross home, while forgetting hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.
Texas belongs to the U.S. states that the most suspicious of COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to comply with deviations, there is a great challenge for possible evacuation.
Provisional gyms were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Texas district of Hidalgo, one of the buildings was also customized as a roof after evacuated, who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to infections.
The local authorities invited all the evacuated to take backs and disinfectant gels with them, if possible.
"We haven't even had it far behind us yet.
We are expecting disastrous floods," cited Chrise Birchfield's AP agency, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts claim that in some places, in a few hours, up to 300 millimeters of precipitation could be overwhelmed, in some cases less than 500 millimeters, which could jointly flood a number of seats on the coast.
Zeman Lending General Value of Colonel Lipkov
President Miloš Zeman in the midst of the general lending position of Colonel Paul Lipkov.
This is based on an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for lending the dignity of the brigade general is the August approach to the position of the commander of the multinational alliance division in Northeastern Poland.
Lipka still acts as a representative of the commander of the Czech army's ground forces.
The upgrade to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Lipka will be replaced by brigade general Karl Řehku as the representative of the commander of the multinational division of the northeast of the Polish Elblag, which commands the alliance units of pre-present presence on the territory of Poland and Pobalti.
Řehka became Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president to borrow the position of the brigade general.
According to the law on occupational soldiers, a higher value may be loaned to a soldier for the period of performing the chosen function or for the period of performing a service task that requires a higher value loan.
The position of the commander of the Allied Division corresponds to the general position.
The soldier to whom the credit is borrowed has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that credit.
However, he does not have the right to adjust the wage that would correspond to that suitability.
The loan shall take place until the reason for which it was granted.
Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional preparedness and is a model for subordinates.
It is significantly involved in carrying out the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring that the army participates in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defense said in June.
The Wednesday’s increase will take place at 12:30 a.m. at Prague Castle, with Lubomír Metnar, Defence Minister, or the Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common air travel hygiene standards to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the departure or wearing shirts in an airplane and at the airport, but the middle seats in an airplane will not have to remain occupied.
She informed the Reuters agency.
"I'm glad my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and we have agreed on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport added that the deal was concluded by officials and that it still has to be formally approved by the Ministers.
The measures agreed shall include a requirement to cover mouth and nose for passengers for six years, to comply with the recommended derogation in safety checks and airport discharges.
Airplanes must also provide sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Aerolinks will also be able to contain medium seats.
The common regulations agreed with officials shall comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused disruption.
The temperature record fell on the Arctic Spicebergs, measured nearly 22 degrees there.
"A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbye," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, exceeding 0.4 degrees from 1979, he added.
Around two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spicberkas, located about 1300 kilometers from the northern pole.
Spiceberries warm up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This emphasizes the danger arising from the heating of other ends of the Arctic, from Alaska to Siberia, according to the last report of the Norwegian Climate Study Centre.
According to him, the average temperature in Spiceberg has risen from the 1970s to the 20th century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can even rise by 10 degrees unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced.
The temperature rise can result in eternal frozen soil dance, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause even greater amounts of lavish and sewing soil.
Climate heating also threatens the Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or thunderstorms that are dependent on the ice coating of the ocean.
British returning from Spain wait for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all roads to Spain, which are not necessary, due to the risk of spreading COVID-19 disease.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Public health is our absolute priority.
We have adopted this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British diplomat said in a statement.
"We've always made clear that in the event that this will be necessary, we will immediately remove a certain country from the list of safe ones," he added.
According to the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect travel plans of thousands of Brits.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
The British are worried whether they will be paid in case they have to end for 14 days in isolation after returning the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-week holiday in Lanzarote, they had to fly on Tuesday.
The trip has been ordered since December.
“We had to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter of Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don’t know what will happen.
I work as a machine leader and I don’t think my employer will come back to the quarantine after returning two weeks of vacation,” said Metro Hunter.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days there have always been over 900 newly infected people in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already aggravating coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia, trying to limit the entire nightlife and prevent people from meeting in a big place.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently noted an increased risk of infections in Catalonia, Aragonia, Baskic and the regions of Madrid.
Model of electricity purchase from Dukovan negotiated government
The government negotiated on Monday a model of electricity purchase from the planned new block of Dukovana Nuclear Power plant.
The bill calculates that if the redemption price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the redemption price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be opposite.
Silk electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that a more likely variant is that people will save electricity thanks to construction.
Analysts say, on the contrary, that a long-term view of electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The purpose has been criticized by ecological organizations.
"The rescue price can be both under the market price of power power and above it.
The final impact at the time of application of the rules can be both negative and positive.
The impact is distributed among customers by the size of the securities – with lower electricity consumption or with higher electricity consumption,” the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in a statement.
Havlíček said in May that he assumes the wholesale price of electricity will grow and people in the Dukovan building will earn.
Otherwise, the impact in dozens of crowns per year for the family, which is much less than people pay each year in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He previously estimated that the redemption price could range from €50 to €60 (about €1320 to €1600) per megawatthodin (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal of the amount, it must be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, at which traders are currently most stocked, is currently about €45 (about €1190) per MWh.
"As a difference in the redemption price and the market price of ten euro power power could cost an average household consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - it can correspond to four-member households, standardly equipped with electrical devices including electrical vessels and ovens, but not using electricity under heating and heating power"
“We live in a extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices as a explicitly speculative issue,” said the CEO of the Energy financial group, Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law shall be calculated by the fact that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, respectively by the legal person entrusted to it owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The agreement between an investor and a state guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible prolongation of ten years, even repeated, but for the longest to end the operation of low carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines it as a nuclear reactor electricity production unit connected to an installed electricity system with a minimum power of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have power of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatthodins of electricity annually, corresponding to tens of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be launched in 2036.
The funding model of the new Duke-Block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should finance the state in the construction without cost, which is calculated at a two-percent interest rate for operation.
With the financing model, the opposition disagrees, it also takes the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70%.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Beneš said in May that the expected sum for building a block at current prices is about 6 billion euros (about 162 billion kroons).
The Treaty between the State and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Duke Block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development dropped the media tourism support material for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend on the media, on the internet and billboards for an advertisement on vacation in the Czech Republic, has removed the office from the commentary management.
Ministerial Klára Dostálová (for ANO) server of Listy Reporty.cz said that the material is still working.
The eKlepu document (electronic library of the legislative process) was noted on Friday server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry's plan justified the failure of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, there was a decline in revenue and media.
The proposal called for criticism of the opposition as well as of tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give through the CzechTourism State Tourism Agency money for advertising on television, radio, press, on the internet, billboards or stations.
Most of the money, 700 million crowns, would get TV.
Most of them will get private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weekly newspapers would get 400 million and the same part would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would get 350 million for the media campaign, most of which private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces on stations or underground.
The tourism promotion campaign in the Czech Republic should start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still working, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented," said Dostál without any further details from the Listing Server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to TOP 09, Pekar’s Markette Adam’s boss, the media would benefit from the advertisement from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andreje Babishe (ANO).
"I strongly believe that this proven abuse will be achieved in autumn at the elections of injury between the eyes," he wrote on Twitter.
In fact, he refuses to say that it is the help of the media in the crisis.
“It can be a coincidence, I don’t know anything about media support,” she said on Friday.
According to it, the budget is two billion targeted.
"Of course, we're still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
Initiately Save tourism does not provide a media campaign to support domestic tourism.
“We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,” said President Tomáš Barčík on Sunday.
If these two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be addressed to companies, not to the media, the initiative in an open letter to the government.
Beer's Death and Beer's Death As a Stage of Herb
The third album, A death, is the herb of the Brno poet, an untired organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erika Friče, who also left a year ago, May 24.
In Frich’s discography, it is the fifth item and, similar to the previous titles, here is the main emphasis on Frich’s poetry, which is an excellent interpreter.
Frich, in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passing through his own personally given experiences, and also very nicer expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from some agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, inaggressive, totally tolerant.
In this context, Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníčkovi), the masters will apologize.
Frič's album offers recordings from 2006, but also shows with musicians who have always accompanied her very sensitively, whether it was a violinist Josef Klüč, or Honza Bartoň and Victor Holata.
I will help me - I love - the words of the poet Petra Hruška of the Frich's long poems.
“They were proud and infinite bitterness,” says Georgia, “beyond the state of our world threatened by destruction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into the sophisticated consumption of contempt and contempt, is increasingly distant from what his soul was created - from the mystery of faith, humility and human proximity.
He was called in them the same as the one who knows that the values for which he was created are very little interested, but he also knows that only because of the general failure they cannot be cut off.
These poems reminded us that a person may have to take care of everything that is expensive, but it doesn’t matter in what way it will take care of.
If she sells a general fall, she skeptically resigns, scaredly falls, or remains until the last moment in a quiet and proud standing on what she believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček.
Former Prime Minister and President of the Czech Republic Jiří Paroubek is not a payable advisor for social democracy.
The President of the Party and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
He said this today in the Prima Partie television series.
The fact that Paroubek should be the Hamak Advisor, the server will be informed by ListmNovice.cz on Friday.
"Occasionally, we write a essay, he will send me some material, and I will read it," Hamaček said.
He added that it wasn’t official and paid cooperation.
The CSD does not have any funds to spend them for similar purposes.
"Occasionally reading his opinion is so many people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS Deputy Minister Janou Blacknoch said that many ODS members are still "insecurely listening to the opinions of Václav Klaus".
It's okay because it's an experienced policy and the former president of the party, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that the media made the apple from it, marked the mark of this year's pepper season.
Server ListenReports.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of an unofficial consultant of Hamáčkov.
He also wrote that on the fourth place of the party's candidate in the oral country, former chairman of the Peter Bend's there cells, which is linked to Paroub and acted as the vice president of his LEV 21.
Hamaček said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a milk mask, it's a bath in the back, the Swedish caller
The 22-year-old U.S. cowboy has an ambition and potential to be one of the most important competitors of the new government.
He already knows what it's like to defeat a two-year-old Duplantise, last year he overcame her at the NCAA University Association.
“We had a battle a year ago, then he won, and I was the second, then we passed it.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," Nilsen describes, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
However, Duplantis has been shooting in the air since then and is currently lonely in the highest area.
In the only twenty years he became a world recorder, this year on February 8, he overcame a 6.17-meter flight in Tornu, a week later he added another centimeter in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," Nilsen's co-worker for the World Athletics website recalled.
“It was clear that as soon as he grows from a boy to a man, all his potential and talent are tens.
"Twenty years is quite a good age to jump the world record," she said.
Being Nilsen’s success counts is less than the one who is proud of Duplantis, the American sets similar goals.
To date, he pointed out his chances at the NCAA races that he won regularly, this year he improved his internal personal record to 5,93 m. Last August he won the gold medal in the Panameric Games in Lima, and in 2017 he played in the U.S. tournament for the world championship, where he played 13.
For the first time, the closest to him is to taste the Diamant League.
"It's definitely my priority to get to a professional circle and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name there," he realized.
"When you can succeed at this level, you can certainly run the same for events as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Panameric Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these top holidays are delayed, giving Nilsen and others time to improve.
But will it be enough to do Duplantise, which can easily turn the race under five rounds into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to reach it, but I don't think it will be in the near future," Nilsen said.
"He's been jumping for 16 years and in training he's got a milestone over all the other."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, it will want to increase it.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands of disabled children's retirement.
The court is waiting for her.
Money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disabled retirement is mainly intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman is in danger of up to eight years of imprisonment.
Due to poor health, the court freed the sick man from injustice, and established his mother with a caregiver, which, among other things, had to manage the money of his son.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, a woman has used a portion of the funds from a child's disabled retirement for her needs and has prepared it for 440 thousand crowns," police spokesman Dana Ladman said in a statement that the accused woman was charged with having a particular interest as a caregiver.
The woman, according to the court’s instructions, established an account to her son, but his retirement allowed her to send to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the child's stay in a medical facility and paying the necessary medications, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of vehicles, electrical equipment and households," she said.
That his son could not use the money for his needs, the woman admitted.
However, she was helping them to pay family expenses.
“We had problems with our income to attract the homework.
We never bought anything overstandard.
It’s always been the things your son would have purchased.
I thought it was a family money.
I didn’t know I was doing a crime,” she explained to the police.
She promised to give money back to her son.
North America has been settled for 30,000 years, scientists say.
The findings from the cave of Chiquihuite in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include in 1930 calcium tools, including soft pearls, which could be used to crash meat, and top objects, which could serve as shrubs or shrubs.
Scientists found that the oldest of the tools came from time 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
“There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean from the University of Zacatecas, the chief author of one of the two studies published in Nature magazine.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people in the caves of Chiquihuite, located at large overseas heights, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the generally recognized theory spoke of the fact that the first representatives of Homo sapiens crossed the fort bridge of today’s Russia in Alaska 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique heroes of copies used to kill mammals and other prehistoric animals, showed that this cloves culture subsequently spread in large part of North America.
This model, however, has been swallowed in the last decades when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were about two to three thousand years older.
The second study published in Nature magazine writes about 42 different locations across North America, which prove human presence on the continent already 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could come to the North American fortress earlier than expected.
Some of them could get ships to America.
"It is obvious that people were in America a long time before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," an anthropologist Ruth Gruhn from the University of Canada, Alberta, told new findings.
Interest in tickets is still filled with an optimistic scenario, the seller said.
Prices are gradually reduced.
Selling tickets in the Czech Republic is growing every week.
In comparison to last summer, the interest is still about half, but demand increases by up to 20% every week.
The development after the crisis, according to salesmen, fills the most optimistic scenario.
The prices of flights are gradually lowering.
The most searched destinations are amongst the South European countries, according to the sellers.
According to data Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are led.
At the Letuška.com portal, flights are most sold to Croatian Split.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought-after, but it is one of the most challenging destinations ever.
The average flight price is also reduced.
At the Letuška.cz portal, about 6250 crowns were moved in half the month, with 3,000 crowns per year less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now accounts for about 85% of sales.
However, prices themselves have fallen in some European places, such as Spain or Italy, in the past few weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets with much less advance than before, because they are afraid of further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information, Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of a ticket was reduced by approximately 10 days a year before departure.
"This confirms the future trend when people will order tickets with much less advances, will require greater flexibility, less risk," said Vice President of Kiwi.com products Michal Šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from Czech Republic is also growing.
At Prague Airport, regular lines are currently operating to more than 60 destinations.
Last summer is about half of the destination.
Great finals tonight!
Follow the Swift Battle live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC was a major final.
It will feature the experienced ninety-four-year-old Scottish shepherd Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, sixty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson hit Justin Pipa in the first round, then hit his neighbor in a table number.
However, James Wad also consulted and in the quarter-final he seemed to talk to Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent a world single home.
"Flighting Scot" was in the semi-final when he faced Michale Smith.
In the last moment, however, he fled the tomb from the lopath, dominated in the prolongation, and after the result 18:16 he played a place in the final of the tournament, which was already held in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljoviče 21:19.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and maybe consciousness that he has nothing to lose helped him to play a completely fantastic wave.
The sixty-six-year-old kidnapper first surprised the world sixth of Nathan Aspinall, Joa Cullen was overwhelmed in a dramatic battle, and Adrian Lewise was overwhelmed in a quarterfinal after a sharp arrival.
A big review was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right on the introduction, but in a quiet Belgian playful, he then gained a remarkable series, which he then held less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scores, which caused occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have occurred at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the first time the new coronavirus was discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been infected.
Nearly 9,600 of them were healed, 368 patients died.
Currently, there are 5,254 sick people.
This results from data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred times each other.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 positive tests were tested, on day 246 earlier and on Tuesday 206.
On the first day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9 590 people have been cured from COVID-19, 63% of all have been infected.
In most cases, the disease had a mild course.
In the hospital, according to recent data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus, 19 of which are considered serious by doctors.
In the Czech Republic there are several fires of COVID-19 disease.
The most infected in the last seven days in recalculation to 100 thousand inhabitants still shows Karvinsko, which is nearly 59.
It follows the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdecko-Mîstecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been applied in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear pants on internal mass events of more than 100 people, it’s about cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals within buildings.
Since Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousands of people to half.
In the world, the number of people who proved to be infected with the new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million limit.
Johns Hopkins University, which is globally monitored by the development of the pandemic.
According to the source, the balance of the victims who died with COVID-19 is nearing 645 thousand.
The latest million infected came to statistics in just three days; the 15-million border fell on July 22.
The largest percentage of rapidly growing cases has been the United States in recent days, which has already recorded more than 4.1 million infected people, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where officials say that nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The infected people are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284 thousand new cases have occurred worldwide from Thursday to Friday, which is the highest daily balance since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of infections is at the top of the nation, such as the United States, Brazil or India, but the number of new cases has grown in nearly 40 countries around the world last week.
For example, Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The infection has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case has been officially announced today by the Republic of Moldova.
The air in the house is up to five times worse than the outdoors.
The health of air refreshing and deodorants is harmful
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was noted by the Israeli health professional Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who deserved the establishment of the Israeli Ministry of Environment, it is necessary to focus on harm in homes right now that many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research from the U.S. Environment Agency (EPA) that domestic air quality is up to five times worse than outdoors.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Due to the coronavirus epidemic that has forced many people to work out of their homes, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it’s time to focus on air quality in their homes,” Abraham said.
In Israel, it says, almost no one cares about the quality of "home air".
At the same time, it can be dangerous things with which a person usually comes into contact - paints, air refreshing, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"One gas is also putting out the clothes we wear regularly in the cleaning room," Abraham said.
The most threatened are children, older household members and people with breathing problems.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, swelling, nasal irritability, nose bleeding, vomiting or skin allergies.
With long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, the internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
Not all harmful things come from objects inside the house, and the material from which the houses are built can be the source.
Vaclav Havlov's question: how long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came in due to coronaviral infection in a team about the chance to move into the highest Spanish football league.
The competition’s leadership canceled the original delayed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could ensure participation in the play off.
