Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a mass corona infection at a large vegetable cabin in Low Bay Mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is supervising the prohibition.
A total of 174 harvest aids were positively tested on the Corona-errent Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the farm office Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday night.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population," Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had already been infected in the operation before - this was the cause of the order.
The farm is a large garden of vegetables, which builds ground beefs, garlics, coal and red beet - but the garlics are only for inlet glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with approximately 3,300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: “According to our information, it is a closed-circle of persons.”
In the court were separated from uninfected employees, the area is now surrounded by a shutdown.
Greens and SPD gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition fractions suggested Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to ignore the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"It can be bitter if such local infections are going out and regional locks have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary director of the Greens.
This looks very similar to the SPD: “We have already requested a special control program after the Corona eruption at the Wiesenhof Schlachthof in mid May also for farms with harvesters,” environmental expert Florian von Brunn said.
“It is precisely the hygiene conditions at work and the living conditions must be carefully monitored from our point of view.
Obviously that didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came with "notification".

Seehofer calls for longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently exposed.
However, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer requests a media report to extend the memory period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for a prolonged storage of data - instead of the scheduled ten weeks a half year.
As reported in the "Picture on Sunday", Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick amendment to the law.
Seehofer will therefore strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considers it meaningful to "make urgently necessary adjustments to the law already now", cites the newspaper.
Currently, stock data is subject to storage.
A decision is expected by the European Court of Justice.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be reasonably checked if legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had spoken for a storage of data in June.
NBA: Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33-year-old basketball professional of Los Angeles Clippers, has left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who has admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is again in isolation, is tested on Covid-19 daily.
Its reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is named in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA Insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.

Söder expresses itself after mass infection to the Corona Lake
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a testofsive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be viewed live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has threatened authorities and policies.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, over a third of them have been infected with the Corona erractor.
The courtyard is currently under quarantine and is closed with a building area.
No one can leave the area, food is delivered.
About 3,300 residents of the municipality now offer free Corona tests.
Since the harvest assistants had little contact with the local population, the farm office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the courtyard.
"Consciousness bisse": Confession of the alleged firestifter of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperatively," said Quentin Chabert's lawyer.
The defender added: “He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him.”
His mandate was "beaten by consciousness and very taken by the extent of destruction".
In the case of a sentence, the man, according to the prosecutor, threatened ten years of imprisonment and a fine of €150,000.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged by a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three remote places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released once again after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the evening of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent penetration into the church, he quickly walked into the investigator’s view field.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rules
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended to consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts," Grindel said.
“For the associations that can become dangerous mostly in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
As far as the debate is concerned, it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to enter this Phalanx.”
However, he has doubts whether in the German Football League there is the willingness to allow majority participations prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“There remains a legal risk of attracting investment scenes in a European single market to the Bundesliga economy,” Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to further tension in the championship".
Even the equation of TV fields will not have a decisive effect.
“The FC Bayern makes a sale of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences are only among the first three associations already enormous.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million,” the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this error and have passed the press instead of responding to me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“This has already been very busy with me humanly.”
He had received the gift worth around €11,000 from a Ukrainian official.
“I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences,” Grindel said.
“With the ominonic watch bag, I have been completely transparent and ardent.
Many of them knew about it in the DFB.”
He has never "made a helmet from the gift," the 58-year-old said.
"It can be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offering
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires reported on Saturday.
"It would not only be irresponsible, but also irresponsible," he said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children live in Argentina in poverty, we cannot increase our creditors’ short-term profits.”
The debts of the second-largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls for its private creditors to give up some of their claims of around $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the government threatens the country again.
It would be the nineth case of payment in Argentina’s history.
Lastly, the lenders had requested higher interest on the debt and amendments to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government holds its last offer and is not ready to accept any further.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was over 50 percent last.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by about 10%.
At the end of May, Argentina had not charged interest claims of $503 million, resulting in a limited payment failure.
Professionally arrived - private yet
"It's running super good" - this phase attracts Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary in Eggenfelden.
In the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she was going to take place at the Eggenfeldener notary office with Lutz Feller's succession.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoted lawyers took up the work that the normal day business runs for long on full tours.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Advisor and laughs.
The short period of time, of course, has not been enough to completely move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she is with her husband, who is working as a judge at the court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has still been able to apply for short-term parental time to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years).
In order not to get out of Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has a stay at her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring circle, Eggenfelden has long been a term.
When visiting on site with her family in the last few months, she recently noticed: "Eggenfelden is a pretty beautiful small town".
The more she was pleased with the fact that she made the race around the free place in the selection process.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional status, her homeland Niederbayern plays a central role: after the Jura study in Passau, she performed her referral time and the second state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary adviser, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also studied the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she joined her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the Landkreis Passau.
In 2016, she went in parental time, after which she finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was written due to Lutz Feller’s nearby retirement, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old said.
The team of her predecessor, who takes over the vacation representation at the notary center in the future, has fully taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has just a praise for the team of the office: "It's running super good!"
It makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming move of the private food point.
With regard to children’s gardens and cliffs, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if you do everything as you wish, you hope to be able to follow your hobby here too soon - and to meet the most beautiful jogging trails of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with up to 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20% for season start in the case of a fan clock.
"Due to the distancing arrangement that is compulsory, we plan for the current stand with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," Borussia Dortmund's CEO Carsten Cramer told the "Dages Mirror".
Usually, the arena in the revier city at the Bundesliga games captures a little more than 81,000 viewers.
In the last season’s fantasy games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB per party had lost about four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal viewers, some of the 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "Of course, it is a strike in the office when these revenues are completely broken off."
Given the ongoing Corona crisis, all of them are “good advice to take a stable side length for the first time.”
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are alone in Germany in shortage, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB’s professionals for their payouts to help overcome the crisis: “Obviously, players know that their payouts have a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-term work.”
Small wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Heavier than a Packerl Butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 early babies, which is taken care of at the Grazer Children’s Clinic annually.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a couple - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so strong that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear puppy clothes and specially made mini-windows for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," shy Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even if they don’t scream as loud as big babies.”
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James Bus Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the holidays began.

The students were able to exchange them via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and the performance.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current situation of Corona.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the area of the lesson.
Although all stakeholders finally agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would still offer additional rise, the theatre also views the potential for contact to schools.
"When we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to gaming operations," said director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz iron design confirmed from AfD - FDP speaks of "Fig Blatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a fig leave and nothing changes the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD,” FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided with a majority in May, on Saturday after several hours of negotiations in Stuttgart.
Kalbitz is president of the AfD Group at the Brandenburg Landdag.
"If the AfD really was about removing right extremists consistently from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
However, there is no political will in the AfD for this, because right extremism is now part of the party.”
Likewise, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "What Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now, says nothing and changes nothing," he said.
"But there are more bands, as many frenetic supporters have a right-wing extreme in the midst of the AfD."
The flower is expected that the AfD will fall back under five percent in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "flights" around the Thüringer president of AfD country and fraction Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection stumbles the stream as "secured right-wing extremist ambition".
In May, the AfD Board of Directors Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason he stated, Kalbitz did not specify a former membership in the now forbidden right-hand extreme "Heimattreuen German Jugend" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests membership in HDJ.
The President of the Left Group at the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the federal arbitration court’s decision had nothing to change in the character of the AfD: “The wolf had only eaten cream.
The AfD remains a right-extreme party, whether with or without calbitz.”
With this decision neither the Federal Party will weaken nor the right wings.
"The Manufacturing of the Meuthen Troop is transparent.
“We want to escape further observation through the constitutional protection and try to pass under the radar,” Walter said.
"The AfD will not release the spirits that called her.
A raid is not changing yet," Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in Kalbitz case.
"This is where the AfD country association and the group remained its right leader until today."
The legal dispute about Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now oppose the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court in civil law.
Nordsee wind parks provide 21% more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have powered the network in the first six months of the year 11.51 Terawatt hours.
These are well 21 percent more than in the same period of last year, the network operator Tennet reported in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea Stream to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wine plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network, have supplied electricity for another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh).
Overall, the wind flow from the North and Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The winds on the sea account for nearly 19 percent of the entire wind flow in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks ensure higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is in addition to the wind ratios of higher production capacity because new wind parks have gone into the network over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6.7 Gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for it; it is 7.1 Gigawatt, according to Tennet.
By 2030, it will rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we invest up to 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," Tennet business director Tim Meyerjürgens said.
In reality, wind parks can also not exploit their capacity on sea, but reach about 40%.
The record day of this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind parks produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce approximately 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This means that nearly seven million households can be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for 130.
Anniversary of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona pause.

Freital: Windbergfest cancelled for Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city party.
"We really haven't made this decision easy and, in the consciousness of how difficult it is economically for the stakeholders, we hope until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
“But finally, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here.”
For if tens of thousands had flown to the fixed ground and to the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be observed in accordance with the current Crown Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left from a public party.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring burden would increase disproportionately by multiple times.
Rumberg voted for next year.
Then the city Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, among other things, with the Winterberg Festival from 7th to 9th May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10th to 12th September 2021.

More flights in Worms in the future
The Wormser High School goes further into the airlines: The "DFS Deutsche Air Safety" founded a professional for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS is now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the profession there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This allows students to be trained twice as much as they have been trained.
At the same time, the capacities are equally charged both in the high school and at the DFS Air Guarantee Academy.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professional.
Represented at college since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training for air loans at Worms College in Air Traffic Management.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
“In these times, the promotion is not economically easy for us.
However, we are firmly expecting that the air traffic is recovering and growing again in the long term.
In order to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS in the signing of the contract.
“For the DFS, the Foundation Profession is a future-secured investment that will provide airlines with a broad, professionally widespread knowledge base in the long run.
Therefore, we continue good cooperation with the university while simultaneously encouraging our attractiveness as a employer.”
This also underlines Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms College: “The foundation professorship constitutes an important bridge between science and economy.
With her, we would like to link to the existing cooperation with DFS German Aviation Assurance as a practical partner for the dual bachelor’s degree course Air Traffic Management.”
The confidence of Germany’s air assurance is at the same time for Worm’s high school motivation and commitment to further expand its teaching and research skills in the future fields of aviation.
In the use of tomorrow’s air loans, the university with its first foundation professorship for a dual study course can set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, underlined: “Worms University has a unique characteristic in Rhineland-Pfalz with its emphasis on aviation.
Today's signature of the Co-operation Treaty strengthens the high school's profile."
Rescue screws land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully shut down on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, since after a traffic accident the rescue screws were in use.
A 76-year-old drived a car at 12:40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit right in the curve and landed on the board.
Due to the blow, the front airbags were discharged, the driver suffered mild injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old driver’s injuries were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient fled to a hospital after the rescue surgeon.
At the moment, the police believe that there is no risk of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be removed.
Heil wants to examine other industries by meat industry
The Corona crisis re-enlighted the state in parts of the meat industry.
Infringements of law are shortly before.
But they are right - and will it remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other industries as well, according to the strict regulations currently planned against defects in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning to restrict work contracts in general.
After the mass outbreak of the Corona at the Meatries Tonnis in North Rhine-Westfalen, the federal cabinet will decide a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large slaughterries should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in slaughter, decomposition and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and renters is prohibited.
Employeer President Ingo Kramer said, “Fingering away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee transfer if you don’t want to completely demolish the economy.”
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for broad areas of craftsmanship, construction and plant construction.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil said: “My goal is not to prohibit work contracts everywhere in the German economy.”
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial business orders a craftsman to build a safety plant, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat economy considers a prohibition of trade treaties and renting work alone in its industry unconstitutional.
It is unclear why portioning and packing cheese should be considered a different work law in the future than in the worst, according to an opinion on the bill, as reported in the New Osnabrücker newspaper (Saturday).
As a result, consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Multiple Eastern European employees from work contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn’t have a break.
Wage was reserved for protective equipment or rental.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law has already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, "triple structures" have turned them around.
"Now we need to be thoroughly deployed."
The politician announced: "The Labour Protection Act we want to decide at the cabinet at the end of July also includes measures not only relating to the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates in the field of labour protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of the rights of workers in the meat industry and the law on the protection of labour.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like to make even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transportation," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
For more controls, more staff are also required.
Three deaths in a breakdown of ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultralight airplane collapsed on a multi-family house in Wesel, Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, police said.
A child has been easily injured.
Two more people were saved injured in the accident, a spokesman from the circuit station Wesel said.
The police said there was a fall screen at the accident site.
The "Rheinical Post" reported on eye witnesses that the plane was crushed with a hot air balloon before the collapse.
The house is a single or two-family house.
More details were not first known.
The breakthrough of Frankfurter Opernplatz is peaceful
A week after the outbreaks in Frankfurt, the smoke of the opera square is also peaceful on Sunday night.
Lastly, a few dozens of people stayed on the spot, but they left him before the start of the closing hours at 1:00.
Police have been in use since early evening with numerous officials, seeing a larger police order throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, a ban was made for the opera square, where there was cravings a week ago.
Police were attacked with bottles out of the number of celebrators.
At least five police officers were injured, several police vehicles were injured.
The night on Saturday was also quiet.
Car is overwhelmed: young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar seriously injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the clinic Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the firefighter searched for possible co-chairs.
The woman, according to police, was on the federal road 83 on the road towards her home town, when her car had gone out of the road for an unclear reason so far and had crossed several times.
In order to save the accident, the firefighter had to cut off the roof of the truck.
Because it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was removed from the rotator with a thermal camera.
Also, the drone stack from Warburg, which also works with thermal cameras, was ordered for the search for individuals.
However, the forces found no one among the high corn plants.
The severe injured was brought to the cabinet clinic with the rescue car.
Nearly 50 firefighters' forces Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a rescue door by Cristiano Ronaldo, Juventus Turin recorded the Italian championship for the ninth time in the series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the association's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night at the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo arrived at 1:0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who was injured without the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer going out of space two days before the end of the season series A.
The Inter Milan Table range is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met with the last motion.
An example of Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old exploded directly from the stratum border with a flat wing (45.+7).
Together with the most offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved at 2:0, after his shooting Federico Bernardeschi (67).
This was the unpleasant but decisive success.
The Foulelfmeter missed at the latte in the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself, with regard to the Tor Hunter Value, would have been correctly ashamed.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and the momentum is changing very easily,” said trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great,” the Juve coach said.
Due to the defeat, the tournaments had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve was due to the calming advancement at the table head, especially because of the weakness of the competitors.
For in the eleven matches before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Will Ronaldo still be the king of the torch, is questionable.
For as the Portuguese Superstar reached 31 doors, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his triple package at 5:1 (1:1) of the Lazio Roma at the Hellas Verona table has already scored 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bavarian title winning.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve Prof. Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinean achieved 36 doors for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the Italian football's "Old Lady" is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands at the Champions League’s eighth final, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, he has to play a 0:1 playground to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.O. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal authors
Despite all threatened punishments and court judgments, drivers in countless illegal races on the Baden-Sürttemberg roads continue to go to gas: in the last year and the first four months of this year, police have already registered more than 250 illegal drivers in the southwest.
Although there are no comparable values for the years before, the racers are doing more and more work to the judicial authorities: in the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as indicated by the Ministry of Interior’s response to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers have spontaneously attacked each other or have taken the escape from the police – this is also apparently illegal race.
There were German men aged between 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times detention
Only in comparatively few cases the raser is captured and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 free penalties have been pronounced.
However, there are no evidence that the number of illegal drivers is actually increasing.
Instead, other car drivers reacted more sensitively due to the tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Especially popular in racers, the motorway 8 is always braking the road to get space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was captured near Kirchheim under teck, three months before even 18 drivers were on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police record even more races than any other federal highway.
With a tempo limit, it is attempted to blow the rasher on the particularly affected section between the neck and the geese.
The most affordable and luxury sports and luxury cars often have Swiss marks because drivers are deviated from the high penalties for too fast riding and car racing in the neighbouring country to rase to Germany.
For the SPD, the tempo limit cannot be reduced to a few routes: “With a general tempo limit of 130 hours, we would create this problem on highways from the body,” says Martin Rivoir, traffic experts from the SPD Landtag fraction.
"The barrier threshold for raser would be significantly higher if you would not be legally here and there with 200 hours kilometers and more on the way."
Rivoir says less of clarification or image campaigns: “Whoever sets himself in such a way over all the rules and not only puts on his own life, but also the life of other carriers is hardly yet to reach with reason.”
ADAC calls for more intervention in police
The ADAC, however, is not enough: “We expect that Raser can’t be disturbed from the tempo limits,” says Holger Bach, Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional and also harder checks on the routes affected.
Not rarely, from the high-touring force measure, there is more painful and follow-up seriousness: from January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the race, two of whom have not participated in a night crash in the centre of Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men have delivered a car.
One of the vehicles came out of the road, surrendered against a garden wall and stayed on the side of the 18-year-old driver who died.
21 more people were injured in the course of the last two years.
However, harder punishments are not necessary, according to Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: “The need for legal action to sanctify illegal motor vehicles is not seen harder,” says the Ministry of Interior paper.

Illegal Tuning Meetings in Nürnberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials were at the top of 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
However, only a small portion of the presence of the "autoposer" and tunes are assigned.
Obviously, most of the relevant scenes came to the police call.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on the site, it must be assumed that it is mainly a sharp person.
In addition, the large proportion of the presences of the existing infection protection regulations, particularly the maintenance of the minimum distance and the carrying of a mouth-nose shell, was maintained.
The control measures carried out on site were ended at 1:00 p.m.
In total, in 10 vehicles, officials found such constructive changes that the operating permit was broken.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No authors

News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the involved slipping company: “They have all beautiful beams that we should not crush,” said Schrödinger.
To do this, special tapes would be used.
Even because the cars are broader, the company should be careful not to make damage.
“Young people should finally keep their cars unheard of.”
Labour agency numbers: 900 suspected cases of short-term abuse
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) reports about 900 suspected cases of short-working abuse.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the Frankfurter General Journal.
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis, very many companies had suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to respond quickly.
The test usually takes up to three weeks.
“We weren’t available so much time at this hot stage.
The more accurately we will look at the final calculations.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot more.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analytics software uses to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency in autumn.
Will there be much more insolvency than last year?
The estimates are different, but we are washing ourselves for the case and now training our employees in the work agencies to process applications for insolvency funds.”
The numbers are still not noticeable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the new garden.
The meeting was dissolved by the drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens (SPSG) at 20.48 p.m., the Foundation reported on PNN inquiry.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people had played Rugby in the New Garden.

It’s always happening to illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the Foundation there are repeatedly gatherings that do not comply with the Remote and Hygiene Rules of the Covid-19 Emergency Regulation.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, celebrating about 150 people in the New Garden a week later.
Even without corona regulation, the parks will be closed when the dark breaks.
The warehouse on the wires is prohibited according to parking arrangement, there are only few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.

In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, on Sunday night 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Massentests after Corona's outbreak in tourist location
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona eruption in the popular non-Austrian tourist site St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the country authorities reported in Linz.
More than 100 results remained in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday has been positively tested.
Residents, guests and tourist staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The closing time was set at 23 p.m.
“There are and there are cancellations and cancellations” of bookings, said the chief of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, who was the leader of the DPA.
Guests will also be departing in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with over 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, about one-third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections were publicly announced.
Alois Lanz, the head of the district office, defended on Saturday the behaviour of practitioners who had celebrated in several locations and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he told the radio broadcaster Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 young employees.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang were contacted from July 15th.
The eruption raises memories of the Austrian skiing and party resort Ischgl in Tirol, which in the early stage of the pandemic was a center of the Corona spread throughout Europe.
Over 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.

Manchester United was led by a punishment by Bruno Fernandes (71th minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-play time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions League Achtel Final opponent of the FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
“This means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach, also stands against Arsenal in the final of the FA Cup.
Chelsea’s victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, who still crossed the wolves with a mager 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starts as the sixth in the European League.
Aston Villa decided the remote ball with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, but at West Ham United he had to run for a long time around the classroom.
Jack Grealish's late leadership (84.) was equal to Andrej Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was gained because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, who watched three trainers in the season, rises after five first-liga years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English champion since late June, has secured an association record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 Counters are the highest value ever achieved by Reds in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp missed the score record in English football with his team.
The best brand holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) tournament for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club it was an exceptional season," Torschütze van Dijk said after the game, "it should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be difficult."
In the end, the Premier League boss will be also satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, the football operation in England was interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
Meanwhile, even a premature interruption or a disruption of the remaining games on neutral ground was discussed.
Finally, however, the season could be played at the end without special events - but as in Germany without a viewer at the stages.

North Korea Releases Border City After Corona Suspect
Until now, North Korea has seen a “slow success” in its own actions to defend the coronavirus.
The country reports for the first time a suspected case.
Due to the first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely stolen a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, the malicious virus could have been enclosed into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency status has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the discharged country.
So far, North Korea had not recorded any single infection and described its defence measures as a “light success”.
The information was suspected abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were found in a "extractor" that illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and now returned over the border.
For the cross-border crossing within the four kilometres wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea’s military reported the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There were investigations in some people.
North Korea, according to its own reports, called on an emergency meeting of the working party’s Police Office, chaired by power holder Kim Jong Un, on Saturday due to the suspected case.
“Dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster.”
Kim has already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate each district and the region from others."
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, have been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the behavior of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose severe punishment.
In Kaesong, estimated 300,000 people live.
Pressure before the Council: City-East and noise protection are still in front of a large summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the Board will also vote on the construction plan for the big project Central city development-East," said the city press release to the next municipal meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 16.30 pm in the Congress Center Hall Pforzheim.
In particular, the evaluation of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of this is short, lately even refused in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (build, real estate, commerce and IT), which now fails to make the project developed by the Governing Council and then by the Municipal Council, criticized the project opponent Reinhard Klein as "external parliamentary opposition", "speculation", "speculation" and "fake"
"Everyone thinks to know better," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim City Council for a year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he said in this position: “I know what I am talking about.”
The exit comes cheaper to the city, the Technical Council is against the statements of the city administration, according to subsidies, of which Klein is convinced to regain for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop completely differently when predicted in the Council and from the supporters of the economy.
The city by its own power and not to create an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also refuses the project, introduced an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides the renovation of the Technical Rathause, the opening of the Schlossberg, the rental of the former hall for administrative areas and a smaller interior design in ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will mainly play a key role.
This is how the municipal council will vote, among other things, on the noise planning.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise damage caused by road traffic, including many temporary reductions.
In a press release, the German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of the rate 30. But political officials in the city are not innocent because they have to do so because they have to ignore line bus traffic with expanse rates and because they have little commitment to bicycle traffic, so the massive rise of the car traffic and the rise of the car.
The Municipal Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda of accession to the Baden-Württemberg Country Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parents’ contributions to the urban children’s day facilities and the application for entry into the Smart City Promotion of the Federation.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to protect Corona.
Tim Zimmermann starts with a lot of delay in the new season
With almost a half-month delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season at ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of the supersport cars can take the regular operation, the first test trips began.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the lausizer ring and could get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are a few things that are different from the porsche from the season,” Zimmermann says.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go to the curves differently.
But it really had a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst to share his orange sports car at the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Netherlands has been able to help its new teammate in many ways.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsports, but every new series also brings new challenges,” Zimmermann says.
“Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made huge progress in the lausizing ring from session to session.”
At the Lausitz ring, the GT Masters will also perform its first race.
As of July 31, the 33 supersport cars will be racing through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, one of 15 Serienneulingen, knows the route.
He was the last guest in the Motodrome in 2015.
"It has worked quickly and I had to get used to the route little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The lausitzting ring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann is then, it will appear in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little bit at the tests," he says.
“We are very pleased and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.”
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, there will be seven races.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
By mid-August at the Nürburgring ring, the former Formula-1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will be headed into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Transport Minister of the Quarantine Decision Cold Approved
The British government’s decision to put Spanish officials under quarantine for two weeks after their return, said the country’s Minister of Transport was cold.
As a result, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the action on Saturday.
Due to the rising numbers of Corona in Spain, the London cabinet pulled the country from the list of countries from which an entry is possible without quarantine orders.
The new regulation will apply today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantines.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the arrangement applies to those who are just on the day of vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is considered to be one of the “safe countries” for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Independent ministers may have previously known that there is the possibility that a quarantine will be taxed for holidayers in Spain," Labour Deputy Diane Abbot said.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict output closures, the infection numbers in the country will rise again.
Virologists are mostly responsible for the new spread of nightlife.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries in the UK.
From unnecessary travel to the Spanish continent, the British government currently recommends that the particularly popular Canadians and Balearics are excluded from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hyperscale weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of the warships with the most modern hyperschal weapon.
With these unique weapons in the world would expand the fighting opportunities of the Russian Navy forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Navy Parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed the agency of successful tests of the hypersonic zircon built for the Navy.

They are considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropheo is further constructed
It is further built on the atomic underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who also operated a military boat, said that only 40 new ships would be put into service this year at the individual fleet associations of the world’s largest country.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has safely defended Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by the Navy across the country.
Also in many other Russian coastal sites, the sea forces start the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights alongside power owners Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated a weapon view in the Mediterranean port of Tartus force.
The ammunition was fired there as well.
In a video published by the Ministry of Defense, there were not only warships, including a submarine, but also fighter hubs and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help is difficult for Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit on land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and severe rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA reported on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott called for an emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic that greased in Texas made the helpers work harder, Abbott said.
Evacuated for caution
“Every hurricane is an enormous challenge,” Abbott said in the newspaper “Houston Chronicle”.
With regard to the spinal storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is even worsened if you consider it climbing through a territory that is the most affected by Covid-19 territory of the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died alone in Texas as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called for caution to people who had to leave their homes.
They should not miss practices, "to which we have used," such as wearing masks," the governor said.
It’s important that everyone keeps the distance.
In some places, hotel rooms are also provided.
In addition, it should be tested on Corona in emergency accommodations.
Initially only damage was reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning returned
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land, according to authorities on the island of Padre Island right before the Texan coast.
The tropical tower was previously raised to the hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first adopted and later returned.
The authorities were expecting a weakening while "Hanna" continued to go into the countryside and contribute to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was travelling on Sunday night with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour towards Hawaii.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected this year, after a May prediction, an over-median active hurricane season.
From June to the end of November it is expected to have up to ten hurricanes, of which up to six very strong spine storms, the authorities said.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic per year, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 per cent, which is only 10 per cent under average.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely watching the storms and staying in contact with the affected states.

Now it is necessary to create the special one yet,” Flick said.
Until Munich can deal with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve in concrete way, it is the first time the eighth final obligation against the FC Chelsea.
After the 3:0 game in front of the Corona pause, the Londoners in the native arena shouldn't be again as in the lost "final dahoam" 2012 as Bavarian dream.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank confidence with a good game,” Flick said.
A test to vote will be held against Olympique Marseille on Friday.

He welcomed 31 players on the Sebener Street, including the new actors for award-winning shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the spot after turning from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all new ones, has been well inserted," Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to coach, Flick would rather talk about the current German series champion title project.
After days of single and small group training, Londoners are now trained in team strength, which are unlike the Flick assembly in the game rhythm.
Afterwards, the Munichers could have a quarter-final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final are possible opponents of Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.

All of the performance carriers were involved, including Tiago’s volunteer and defender David Alaba, whose stay was not secured over the royal class season.
Formula 1 requires a special rule to curb their world champions
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA has to improvise to grant the WM title.
All American races have been cancelled.
Race calendar becomes more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the 10 confirmed Grand Prix, three other racing routes were added during the week.

Thus, the numbers of infections in São Paulo are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams that do not want to drive in Brazil would also not justify the refusal.

Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular U.S. Latenight show by video shutdown.
She told, among other things, her struggle against the powers of the world.
Also about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump, the teenager spoke.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made attention to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans in the future, as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She not only talked about her struggle against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powers of the world.
“There are some things that have surprised me,” she said.
"How far people go to drive the focus away from the climate crisis," she shouted.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children goes on the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who oppose them in social media or try to silence them, finds them "small" because they show the reactions "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter look at U.S. President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Atlantic actress sealed, her expressive view was captured from the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since then.

Fleetwood Mac Co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a railroad trip: after a fast rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steadily down and then slowly back up.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drugs-junkie, cult adherents: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members shared an official opinion on Saturday, another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac.
Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing legendary band in 1967 in London, until today is unforgettable his dream instrumental hit "Albatross".
The musician's life ("The End of the Game," "In The Skies") was like a trail journey.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise – the band celebrated its greatest success but then without him.
It should have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide clothing and with a large crossfix.
Mental problems have also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the image surface.
He is supposed to live on the road temporarily as a funeral gardener and have spent some time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish labour family in the district of Bethnal Green in London.
In young years, he was excited for American blue musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was eleven, he learned the first guitar attacks.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly later, he was engaged as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The Green composed song "Albatross" gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed his shadow sides: Green did not push the media, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and demand later commented in an interview: “The worst thing that happened to me in my life is drugs – the best thing was to land a number one hit.”
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 was a surprised success with an album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in a new form on a successful wave.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not get a larger comeback until he restarted with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British Daily Telegraph talked about a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released some albums without drugs with Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend – and with his soft sound, one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
