Parliament did not support the novel released by Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected the proposal to revoke a paragraph under the amendment of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Julia Tymošenko, was condemned.
The amendment, which would open the way to the release of prisoners, refused by the Members of the European Parliament to read the proposal for relief of fines for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison for concluding an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not competent, the court has to negotiate the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymošenkova is a judge for the political msc of the regime, suspected of the court's insurgentity, which has also filed a trial in the West.
The proposal for paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by the vote of 147 Members.
Its approval requires 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him after war.
It remains to define the winner.
As usual in the country, Islamists win in the elections, but it’s about whether they die or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed itself to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya becomes a country without crime, because the hand is cut for stealing.
Women can forget about the emancipacy, possible debris of faith are waiting for a sentence and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the company consisting of competing tribes will unite the Quran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we would certainly not want.
Only our way of life is not the only one, or objectively the best, and most of all would not match the Libyans for the change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic warriors took gratitude with the help of non-believers dogs.
It’s only the fact that NATO’s arrivals were not controlled by any general from America, but by Allah, whose size was celebrated in every intervention.
When the winners are searching for Libya, the west does not belong to them.
We took part in shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, as a dictator, got rid of the political allies without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya does not occupy military.
With this fall, the problem of the "cross" is falling out.
Will they have an oil company for Libyan black gold without occupation?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to praise the infinite protection of human rights.
If we don't have to do so, the sheriffs of the Sharia law are not allowed to do so.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have been searching for investors.
The statistical smell passed across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated mexicanally, Germany and France are growing.
Today, the debt market has records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
Statistical authorities in the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and some other countries in Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
GDP has increased by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries, at the same time, adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was closer than expected (0.3% growth instead of the original 0.1%), so France stated that there was a slight decline of 0.1% (the original figures spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy rose by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated a quarterly period and, according to the CCP, confirmed the trend of slowing down the economy’s performance.
The results are worse than estimates of analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy rose by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated a quarterly period.
The German economy in the third quarter, according to the preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, rose by 0.5 percent.
The Eurozone and the European Union economy rose by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2% annually.
The revenue on its 10-year debt is 28.45%.
The revenue of Italian and Spanish debt bonds is growing to critical borders.
The problems begin to feel as well as Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The revenue of 10-year-old Czech bonds is less than 4%, although the situation in the region is getting worse.
From Germany, the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Black Mountain, they won 1:0 and celebrate 200 million
Football has managed the hardest task of the season!
In the Black Mountain and thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful branch of Petra Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football even with a large portion of luck in the second half of the time has been swallowing a luxurious mask from the home industry and will never again be missing at the European championship.
IHNED.cz watched the process in detailed reporting.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of luck in the second.
Thanks to the home loss in the end, the great Czech and hero Jirakovici won 1:0 in the Black Mountain and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
The Black Horse, due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic, came to pressure until the second half of the time.
The Smolars of the match became Damjanovich with Vučinič, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Petru Czechov, the Czech Republic will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize of about 200 million krones will be added to the national football cash.
There has been a lot of fighting football in the first few minutes.
Both teams were hard to join the combination and played mainly around half-line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half, since the Czech defense precisely dismissed long copies behind the defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred universities have created a living shield around the nuclear object in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program against the possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then provoked the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from Iran’s Isfahan universities created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center in which uranium is processed on Tuesday.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
In a recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran had not ceased to strive for nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear power plant is discussed in Israel.
Students prayed in the afternoon before entering the ISFA nuclear facility and then provoked the death of America and Israel.
In the case of an attack, which would be intended to protect the Iranian nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, apart from the Isfahan centre, it would also be targeted in Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Obesity baby dinner: no breakfast and dinner dinner
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with overweight 9 per cent of schoolchildren and obese 5 per cent of children.
Obesity children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle, as a recent survey has shown.
It is shown again how important it is for the healthy development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns it is surrounded.
For example, on the tables of obesity children, assertions occur up to half more frequently than in families of children with normal weight.
The dinner was a day before the research associated with an event called Obesity, the accident was not more than 19 percent of obesity.
There is also no habit of sporting in the families of obsessions, but most of today’s schoolchildren’s families – only 15 percent of children responded that their parents find time to move actively at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The study was conducted at the end of last school year and there were nearly 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event not an accident that is supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th class have participated in the project.
Correct diet and sufficient movement in the family is one of the decisive factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“Only half of the questionnaire said it was five times a day in the breakfast-buffet-buffet-dinner regime, which is one of the basic conditions for proper nutrition,” one of the results of the survey said.
Without breakfast and evening dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development, relative details, including regular family breakfast time, are also important.
At the same time, only 23 percent of school families have breakfast in Czech Republic.
In most families, everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst was to find that in a dozen households they don’t sleep at all.
Breakfast is the basis of the proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy foods are consumed much more frequently.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemons every day (70 per cent).
Regularly, more than 40 percent of children are sports, but in their parents, the result was less than half - 15 percent.
Create your dining room
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make up their own dining options according to their own taste and opinion.
“The nutritional preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from a healthy diet.”
Among their favorite foods is a lot of powerful, mass and sweet foods.
"Alarming is particularly a large population of sweet limonade," the final survey report states.
For lunch as the main meal, the teaspoons won just above the poultry.
However, children almost didn’t want lushine at all, and they were low in fish and soil vegetables.
Examples of Health
At the same time, a survey showed that children are willing to adjust their nutritional habits if they get the right information.
"For the control group of participants in the survey who filled up the questionnaire after the completion of the constellation of obesity, there is no accident, a significant advancement of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition has occurred in a number of cases," the results of the project said.
For example, it was marvelous for sweet limonade, where more children would start to prefer ordinary water.
Children also more frequently checked poultry and fish as the main food of the day and restricted sweet foods and chickens.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professional says.
In the start-up article about how stylists learn, I was so a little embarrassed that there was a lot of it in the start-up hours.
I didn't know what's going on.
The lectures of three professionals in the field, dressing up problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks are waiting for us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "found".
This time, Alenka and I discussed (not the only boy in the course) how to dress a woman who has no perfectly consistent character.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boy's character again without a good curve, and someone overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically shake the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We’ve got the tips for women like Jennifer Lopez, that is, larger chest and sides and a narrow paste, to emphasize the character well and at the same time not to dress a woman too appealing.
For example, if the difference between the passport and the sides is such that the shirts or pants are not really sitting, then it is worth keeping at least one such piece in peace.
You will certainly not regret, because the perfectly falling clothes are unpaid.
In a dress of peace you will feel much better than in a dress that constantly moves you, shrinks, leaves in the passport and so on.
The boy's character can also allow himself to wear clothes with stretch, apps, lifts or charge.
Such information and types of characters are of course a lot, so I’m glad I’ve got all the week to set up all the information in my head.
And I am also afraid that, in view of the home task set, it is only until now.
Each of the courses has received a designated celebrity, which has to invent two outfits: daily and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality and the type of character.
I'm gonna dress Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my spirit, for me, it is definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently picked up a hundred pounds (please take it in the face of the deal) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes from magazines or search on the internet and print and then process graphics.
Moodboard, as the whole result is said, will also express our personal style and relationship with graphic design.
Thinking of the graphic page of styling is also important.
For the stylist is not only physically dressed, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines, for example (on specific tasks such as trends of cables, jackets, etc.).
This was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it's only on Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture with information about the character types was immediately dismissed by three guests from the industry.
Stylist Honza humiliated, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a skilled stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So, such a trench (or if you originally want a trenchcoat) can be weared classically through the jeans and a trick as a garment, but you can also wear it on the nail body, wear the boats and photograph as a dress.
Or just scratch your sleeves or sleeves and right now the whole look looks different.
"Let's play with that," he emphasized.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
“So you can start infringing them,” Jacob said.
Finally, I don’t know why we’re knocking all the lessons to combine with, why, even when we see something different in the fashion magazines of the leckdy.
Overviews, not even talking.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist has to have much more clothing variants prepared than how many of them are photographed.
So in fashion story, which will have ten sides (these 10 outfits), I have to be prepared to "set" at least fifteen.
And also that the photo of clothing looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckdy completely different than in fact.
We need to count on this when creating an outfit.
That image and style make up to half of success, we have confirmed Honza Poorny.
Just look at Madonna, which is not just a miracle singer, but image and marketing made it a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the use of stylists’ services is rather cool.
Even well-known faces are considered to be unnecessary (because I know something, it's secondary when I look like it).
And if any of us already wants to create styling, then we have to count on the fact that it is very likely that it dictates us a completely different (small) size than it really has.
Then it remains only to google and find out if the bulwar did not write about that the celebrity was defeated/defeated and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday told us that stylists were not enough to orient themselves in fashion and to be able to lay outfits.
In his work, he communicates with people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Ability to estimate people, not to submit to themselves, to stand in their opinion.
"When a manager orders you to crawl her clothes and fill her with beautiful pieces, you can't throw her out of the box and say, God, that's a terrible thing."
“Let’s get there at least a few things that you’ll get upstairs and recommend what they can do,” Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "plate" or a place bag.
It’s the one you turn on around your passport and have all the necessary properties.
Except for clear things, such as knives, hair wheels or closing wheels, there is also a silhouette (with it a stylist helps in photographing products such as chapels or hats), special clips that we put behind clothes, if it is larger (slips or other wheels, scratch or scratch).
To not just listen, but also try something practically, we learned how to correctly undergo shoes.
Even when photographing at the theater, where the surface is equal, the irritation could be damaged, even outside.
And so we've tied up and tied up.
We should not even touch shoes so that they do not accidentally harm themselves.
So there is really need for skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reserves.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small break of what we've heard about the second weekend's continuation of the course.
It begins to become more and more clear that devoting to styling at a professional level is really not a walk in a pink set, no matter whoever wants what he wants.
Need for Speed: The Run runs across America.
Recommended
Originally, the unfavorable ride is changed on a routine morning ride on the skiing because of a series of totally unnecessary ice cream errors.
The ambition has been greatly fulfilled, but it’s not true when nobody obviously wanted to do anything else.
A new piece with the subtitle The Run awakened before the release of high expectations.
He promised that the flight of the Need for Speed series would move a bit in a new direction again, and from the playful shows it appeared as a game that would not only have to be a number in the genre of the action race.
We were also curious about the impact of the inlay passports, in which the main hero will come out of the car and will take place in its own.
As with the NFS series, many are a bit different from what we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole is drawing down several unnecessary errors that have occurred in the series for at least a few years.
So, in fact, it’s not a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible flaws of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are listed in the story, whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will sit on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to get to New York as the first.
The idea brings with you a few interesting elements.
The trail is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
As a result, each race goes on different routes and the given stages are set in different, different enough and interesting environments.
You don't even have a moment of feeling that the game would still offer the same thing.
Some of the environments are also very nice in view, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So that's nothing global.
But driving around the desert, autumn landscape or high in snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are sometimes stirred up by an untypical element.
In the desert, for example, you will enter a sandy storm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the contrary, you must be careful in the mountains so that you don’t have a labyrinth.
In addition, there are quite good races behind each other.
There are only a few types, but it’s enough.
When you try to anticipate the required number of rivals (essentially classical race), then you give back time (classical struggle with feet) and then you are waiting for a duel with a single rival.
The police will also join you from time to time, which will further displease all your efforts.
The news is passing outside the truck.
Instead, it’s just such an interactive animation when Jack usually rains in front of someone, and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that these passages are much less in the game than you expected (in particular, perhaps even three).
In the result, however, it is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above spoken, it is so ranked to the elements that the game distorts.
The ride model goes in the tracks of previous parts.
This means that it is definitely no longer more today, but it can’t be said that it would be a disaster.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the most shared racing of the driving model is still quite good, although we could find better in competition.
So then, it's all right.
Problems begin to emerge after some time.
Unlike the model of driving, the model isn’t really good anymore.
We don’t expect this game to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if you don’t have the least idea of how your car is maintained, then it’s probably not all right.
Typically, when you're in a narrow front or mixing cars in normal operation, you're sometimes just slightly shaking each other, but in a nearly identical situation, your car ends in wild pirates.
Or even a straight attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t really matter, but it’s going to deploy you reliably.
Restarts are addressed so that if you break down or go far outside the line, the game will fit you back to the last hit point on the line.
However, restarts are available only five in each race.
When you exhaust them, you need to start the race again from the start.
So it’s rather such a help in the case that something doesn’t happen, rather than you can rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes, however, restarts will not help, they will only be solved by the need to learn from a given section of the race of memory.
The big disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some spins are needed in a specific way, otherwise you will not be shortened into them.
Once again, you will meet the "civil" cars at a given location always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially true in situations when you see how the opponent runs easily in front of you between the two opponent cars, while you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to walk around or hurry.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that this situation always occurs just before your nose.
The opponents also have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will attack several places where you, again regardless of time, will always be the same competitor in the same place.
The most strike at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you eat in the opposite direction.
The counterpart must be there before you at any cost.
When you go ahead, it gets worse of the overview of the anti-cars, so you're starting to expand around a couple of times well there.
You can understand the intention of making the game more stressful and adrenaline, but execution is so obvious that it will deceive you reliablely quickly.
And it’s a shame, because even though the simple driving model is playing fun and places even so actionable that sometimes you don’t literally try to watch where it’s flying.
And essentially, it doesn't matter whether it deserves a concept with fifty unique trails, the ranking of the race so that the boredom has no chance, or anything else.
A non-traditional idea is to exchange cars during the race.
You need to be careful about the gas pumps on the road, because right there you can change the car, although in most cases you’re enough for what you’ve got.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on equal roads and exotic supersports on technical rides, for example, on clicked mountain roads.
The main story mode is hand in hand and challenge modes, which are races in individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
For higher levels of drivers, different items are opened: cars start and end with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and acquires additional community features.
One of the other hard to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you get to the tunnel of the metro (wake up), where you marry it in the dark of the wheels (wake up).
On the tachometer you shine numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (wake up) and the rear of the subway and uncompromisingly crash you.
In the edition, we may have been discussing for a few days whether no one really thought about the game or whether the authors really thought of us as so big fools.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in several cases even great.
It will freeze so that recording falls in some moments, and in some cases it is quite tragic.
However, this is especially true of bowlers with a greater number of participants, when you wouldn’t have the same effect on the ongoing recording.
The sound page is okay and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
Trying to enjoy the most wide range of younger audiences, soundtrack from the category "Every dog is different all", but it is assumed that because of listening to music, there is probably no one to buy the game.
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so much disappointed.
If the game would avoid totally unnecessary errors, then we wouldn’t be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works inseparably.
Fun is definitely fine, but be prepared to make mistakes trigger you in the eyes with the strength of the airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation of negativeists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five to six years before the situation is slightly stable, calm and all players will get used to their new roles," she began her lecture at the Czech Embassy of the European Union, Milena Vicen.
As much as its motto "Comprehensible and openly about Europe" is taken seriously, it has already been shown in the first part of the lecture, where it has been able to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of UK lawmakers may be jealous of it.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuye:
"Initially, criticism appeared that it was insignificant that it was a grey official that couldn't play any role, and I have to say that the breath came out to everyone that that role was greatly worsened."
"It is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, who has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy explained it as a response to the question, "Who is the European Union? What telephone number should I call?", i.e., as an important step towards unification and greater readiness of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us sire
Vicenova has also dedicated itself to the agenda that the European Council has lived and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency declared its success.
The Czechs resolved the emergent financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time then referred to as a great negative that has severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very urgent.
In the words of Ambassador, "fakt frmol" was not only presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is addressed so far.
Moreover, the new seven-year budget of the Union has to be approved, which is very complicated due to the current economic situation.
The budget will be sharp and savings-free, which sectors will benefit from, which countries will be more and less supported, all of which will be on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled his main slogans with which she came to Brussels: “Comprehensiblely about Europe.”
"I really don't like sharp shortcomings, strange words, a handy that no one understands.
"How should a citizen understand that in Brussels there are really no curved or rounded pearls, bananas differently large and that we really have to ban pearls?"
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and bring more Czechs to European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive sides of the matter.
It also regrets the low representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors, such as the modestness of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, he raised the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me that when the Polish and Hungarian come after me and the Slovak approaches, then the French next to me will say, "Hey, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?" and it is not excited about it at all.
In the future of the Union, according to Vicen, the new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States are mainly expected.
As a very real one, he perceives the concept of double-speed, not the multi-speed Europe, rather than the new "European Federation."
"We have the eurozone and the eurozone countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, we have an enhanced cooperation institute."
"For the first time, it was said that only countries who want to cooperate and those who do not want to stand in front of them."
"These institutes will be more and will be a strongly double-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in implementing the principle that all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not only between the Eurozone countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator starts its existence in the second century
If someone was looking for a word that would express the most accurate IBM strategy, it would probably be the closest "long-term longevity".
For the broad public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as a very contemporary company, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation of this long-term was placed by the first chief of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already cut the password that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His password "Think!" became a printing of the life of the future giant (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be released in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's careful corporate culture.
“For us, IBM means a long-term ongoing motion towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for hundreds of years because she remained loyal to its basic values and wasn’t afraid to change everything else around herself.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society in our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more,” Samuel J. Palmisano, CEO, noted on the anniversary.
Processed System
Watson, in the 1930s, approached the care of his employees in the same way as the entrepreneur of Batia in Czech Republic - IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid a vacation, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a processed system for the best remuneration and business rewards.
IBM also has a long-term relationship with the customer.
Since the beginning, the company has been genial in talent gaining – as one of the first companies in the world, it has canceled any discrimination, so it could choose.
According to the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will replace a woman in front of IBM next year – Virginia Rometty.
It has been in IBM for thirty years and has yet to be the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has made so-called online brainstormings in recent years, many of which create future strategies and innovations.
It’s not surprising that ideas are enough - nearly half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with good name
A firm’s strong position in business ensures its strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM has had the concept of an institution rather than just a technological company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems for use of technology," George Colony, a Forrester Research consultant, added.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between entering the market and creating the market straight.
The IBM – or “Great Blue” – has grown into one of the world’s largest companies in one hundred years because of her logo in the United States.
It is apparently the most outstanding technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds most patents from all U.S. technology companies and five of her employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include bankomat, payment card, financial swap, line code or diskette.
IBM has been the second largest technology company this year according to market capitalization (the first is Apple) when Microsoft has for the first time since 1996.
Looking forward
Not all the products and innovations were in the taste of customers and time - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2, online Prodigy service or IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally focus on the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike Microsoft’s competitor, which is basically standing and falling on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM markets have the largest share of the services, with approximately five hardware and software.
In 1990, he was the most powerful hardware representative with more than half of his share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profit assets worth $15 billion, investing $58 billion in purchasing prospective technologies during the same time.
Investment continues since 2008, when the world’s first time has overcome the new financial crisis.
IBM has been acting according to its first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during the major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is not affected by the current crisis.
IBM’s share price has risen by 120 percent since early 2008, the company’s net profit is constantly rising.
The IBM company's password is to change everything, just not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will be able to manage it.
History of IBM: From cheese to flying to space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago and originally had a complex name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of IBM was taken only in 1924 - it was originally the brand used for the branches of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later IBM gave the merger of four companies, whose history covers the 1980s.
They possessed technologies such as famous "square", i.e. hours recording the arrival and departure of employees.
The new company’s architect was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chairman of the company’s supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomase J. Watson's competitor to help him manage the company.
The leader then underwent the founder of IBM - Watson’s thoughts have built an invisible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name indicates, has begun producing and selling all kinds of machinery for business - from meat and cheeses to cabins.
Over the first four years Watson was headed by the company, he doubled his turnover to nine million dollars and began expanding the company to all the world’s shares.
Watson was so unpleasant for the company that after almost forty years in the chief chair he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from the IBM helped NASA drive flights to the universe - on Merkur, Saturn and in 1969, a man’s famous year on the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "pecé" that set computer standard at the time, called the IBM 5150, came into the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer production from Lenovo, on the contrary, purchased an advisory part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully devote advisory services with high value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, "smarter planets".
Its aim is to use technology intelligently in so far unplanned areas and improve the situation, for example, in transport or city management.
IBM recently launched the Smart Commerce platform for the area of trade, which helps traders manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
It founded its branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a global research team dealing with voice recognition.
Ritter about an unfaithful husband:
Iveto, leave that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Ritter (53) said the end!
After his husband Joseph Rychtharie (53) became not only the protector of Ivetya Bartosh (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now it is uncomfortable to wait, and it has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rychthari explained.
When Darina Rittera gave asylum to Bartosh in her home in the summer, she obviously didn’t even think how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved from the Riverian for her urgency after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, with her husband's relationship, she was calm and now even gave him goodbye forever.
The rider doesn't care who his wife is sleeping with
If the Knight with Bartosh only once separated, his wife's open arm wouldn't wait for him at home.
“He is a biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will expel him.”
"But he does not live as my beloved, deceitful old ass, but as a man with whom I have certain bonds," Rychthar said, resigning from his husband, and it takes only to mutual dignity.
The fact that Darina closed the back door to Joseph isn't a problem yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I'm not going to change it."
"The husband set up paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"Darinus and I have been playing quite normally, just as we don't share the beds together," said Blesku Rychtarz.
If she found a new love, she wouldn’t be able to defend her.
“We don’t sleep together and I don’t care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a friend.
"I know that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveda and I take all responsibility on myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst women's bad habits: Are you going to do so?
When you ask men if they could designate any typical female abuse habits, usually everyone in one is very slowly exhausted from the handle.
Dear women, do you know in the following lines, where there are several women's abuse habits that can perfectly spread blood to men in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you are dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cup a week?
Do you like to buy and lots of discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as an abuse habit.
Some women realize that they should at least shorten their shopping passion.
But do you say who would resist it just to walk through clothing stores, look for well-capped tops and then try them all (ideally in various colorful performances) in the cabinet?
Although for most women it is a cat shop, it can become a literally finished hell for men.
Just remember how many times you have said this to your own, that you prefer to wait before the entrance...
Non-continuous disagreement
"I'm not too thick?"
“I need to lose weight at least five pounds – should I begin exercise?”
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Oh, yeah?
Then you belong to those women who are occupied with how they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's like an infinite bullet.
Wash the windows, drying, drying the sheet, losing dust, draining the bath - and it at least twice a week.
Do you calculate to your partner that he slipped a dirty leg on a clean flat, children who scratched the dirty washing machine and wrapped a glassed living wall with which you made so much work?
In the event that you suffer from this "abnormality", try to realize that nothing should be overwhelmed and the order and purity should certainly not be within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can endanger your relationships and family welfare.
Smoking
"Your used coaches are thrown into the basket."
"You're going to take your old jackets tomorrow too?"
"The moisture is not on the ground."
If you do this in your partner several times a day, take it to make sure you can trust it.
Of course, you don’t think that badly, you want to achieve that everything’s okay.
Maybe if the men knew that, women wouldn't have to get rid of them again...
Dizziness, drunkness
For some women, they also own talks, craps, but also insults and assemblies against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so together they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe every one of us will get out of here a small, harmless clay or clay.
Hand on the heart, it's all women's own.
However, they are the sharpest grain that they love and often tremble, perhaps they reject and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women’s work collective.
Jager and Voráček helped assist in winning Philadelphia
The hockey attacker Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL on Monday with two assistants in the winning Philadelphie 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again the leader of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the ninety-nine-year-old stars, Claude Giroux, who added another record and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assistants in the match were also recorded by Jakub Voráček, the co-player of Jágrov.
The player after the race to offshore journalists claimed that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the match, I told him to get a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Occasionally such a feeling will overtake you," explained Jágr, after the action given Giroux the first shot of Flyers.
A short time later, the Czech team had a second intervention.
The warrior fought behind the Hurricanes gates and presented it between the circles to Maximus Talbot.
A second before the first pause, Patrick Dwyer decreased in the weakening of the home player, but the introduction of the second part was again belonging to Flyers.
In particular, Giroux.
After working with Jágre, he shot the third goal, and then his shooting moved to the fourth gate of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
"I would never think I'll play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"I'm happy with it."
"I want to play on him."
"All those years in the NHL, my co-players have tried to play on me, now it's turning," Jagr added.
Carolina still made a drama from the match, a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again Dwyer, who passed away from a criminal shooting, got the difference in one gate.
Another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who finished reading two to one.
"He's been invaded in our Pronger band."
"He shouted a bitch, I picked up the speed and (Read) went to a distance belt."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it went," he described the last round of the match from his viewpoint Voráček.
Philadelphia won the victory in front of the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spaček did not play a race against Buffalo, resigning in the second third for injury in the upper body.
The Candiens, along with the experienced beak, also lost two-sized leadership and lost after a penalty shooting 2:3.
One of them wasn’t awarded by Tom Plekanec.
Rather than lost points, he hated his home coach, a large back row, playing with only five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We played with only one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But it can't be done, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We've been struggling to change and we couldn't resist."
"We had to make the game more simpler, scratch a bunch out of our band."
"We had a lot of trouble in that," said one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrey Pavelec contributed the thirty Winnipeg interventions to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
On the Jets goals, which interrupted a five-pass series of proheritors, five different shooters were divided.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in the Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At the time, travel offices sold in the vast majority only trips to the countries of the Socialist Block, as travel to the West was very limited.
The Czech tourists traveled on vacation to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the possibility of travelling to Yugoslavia was also available, but the Yugoslav regime was awarded the West and the Czech tourists’ journeys to Yugoslavia were then very limited.
The great paradox of socialism was that citizens of the socialist block (i.e. Czechoslovakies) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within the socialist countries.
If a Czechoslovakia citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed a letter calling from that country, otherwise an individual journey was not possible.
Travel offices at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand the front overnight with a pack or to have a "good known" in the travel office.
However, it was not won.
The so-called monetary promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a currency oath it was not possible to obtain funds (western currency) on the way to the West.
Most often, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in their homeland, resulting in a large number of chats and chalups that the Czechs had made and this habit survived so far.
The Czech travel has been a real revolution since 1989.
While in 1989 the NDR or Bulgaria’s vacation was our maximum, the Czech fleets spent 4,5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we do not realize today is that the most popular Croatia for us today was not possible to travel freely until 1989 as it was part of Yugoslavia then.
As soon as the 1990s of the last century, a visa obligation was cancelled in neighbouring Western European countries, which started a huge wave of short-term visits, especially Austrian Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovakies couldn’t get a long trip to the West, everybody wanted to look at it for at least a moment.
For example, the tours of the Czechs fell in tent parks in Paris, as our then income did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
The typical characteristic of the Czech travel at this time was the driving of its own food, conservation, salads, etc. to save it.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely exchangeable Czech crown, which eventually enabled our tourists to purchase the western currency after many decades.
However, our level of life and the average wages have risen, which led to another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have begun regularly preparing tours with charter airlines since 1997, allowing airlines to deal with multiple discounts compared to the past to unexpectedly discounted.
At the end of the late 90s, the Czechs had a visa-free contact with almost all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which continued to facilitate our journey.
Another interesting moment in the history of the tournament took place immediately in 2000, when the historically first direct charter flight to exotics was the result of considerable demand from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, there are direct charters with Czech tourists every year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visit about 100 thousand Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our evolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled a visa for Czech tourists and thus our country was definitely one of the world’s most advanced countries.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history, and lost for one holiday abroad, including the costs of staying more than 15 thousand dollars per person.
The general assembly has to find the president, but again threatening pat
Nearly five months is Czech football without president and threatens that the successor of Ivan Haška, head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be known after another extraordinary general assembly held in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which the election order will be conducted.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelt and Tomáš Paclík.
Hashek resigned in June, and when he left, he invited his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Haško, football fell back to the backs between the two alliance chambers, which cannot agree on a joint candidate.
It turned out on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
Delegations of the general assembly were unnecessary at the National House of Prague in Smich, since the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just the way of election.
There has not been an agreement with anyone who has the right to vote in the assembly – whether only statutory representatives, or even full power officials.
At this point there has been a partial agreement since then, which has also helped the recommendation of the Constitution for State and law, under which a full power representation is not possible.
However, disputes still govern the election order.
It has not been very clear to the situation, nor does the Executive Committee, which, in its negotiations, whether appropriate or extraordinary, does not solve anything else in essence.
The view of the election option has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd wheel to exclude the possibility of suffering?
"The sport is whether to act in accordance with the regulations or to find another model," said one of the three Vice Presidents of FAČR Dušan Sloboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the model proposed in the third round, the candidate will win the candidate who will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber under which he is candidate.
Morava is allegedly willing to go to a resignation to win a candidate who gains a higher percentage of votes from both Chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two-thirds of weight in this percentage.
"If that would remain the meaning of two previous wheels, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," the Morav Party opposes that the best order would be not to move and vote according to the applicable regulations.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this slightly surprisingly, although it is estimated that the appointment of the election is most consistent with all the candidates of Pelt.
"I'm going to choose the maximum according to the statutes."
"In order for some representative distortions not to be thought of like the past general assembly," said owner Viktorie Plzen, who is nominating for the first time and in his statements, restricted himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be known and believe that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"Every passion will calm down the possible process of today's national team for the European Championships."
"Football will be on a happy wave again, will be greater willingness to cooperate," says the Apple officer, who has three of the largest experience in the management of football both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more durable.
"I hope in the deal, but sadly the situation is very split."
"It's not between the people of the Czech Republic and Morava, but there are attempts to target the regulations."
"This can cause the blocking of the general assembly to happen again."
"But I hope that a healthy mind will win," said Rachel.
The agreement of all parties has not been over for a long time.
Some negotiations were supposed to be played directly in the Black Mountain, but who knows whether the football generality will be complete in the match.
The airline, which had to travel to Podgorice, among other things, Vice-President Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to technical infringement and asked for a replacement variant to transport a part of the executive committee to the stage of the Bahrain industry.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which may occur on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Bodybuilding, Josef Dobeš, would like to appoint divided parties within the country’s strongest sport association to the deal.
There is a lot of this in the game: state grants, trustworthiness of football, and also a large crowd of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of the Match.
The pack is fighting for the president because he doesn’t see the right candidate.
If the chief of footballers Plzno Tomáš Paclík had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary general assembly, who would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Association (FARC) or would not join him in the fight for the top function.
"If a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to choose."
“But in the present situation, no one like this was found,” said Paclík.
In the fight against Miroslav Pelto and Jindřich Rajch, Paclík’s woman’s motivation to try to prevent Pelto, the alleged favorite of the elections, on the way to FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he would endure as president only until 2013, when there is an adequate general assembly for the programme.
In the function, he would visually like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected with football events.
"I talked to some people who would come into consideration."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at this time."
“I would like to change such a view,” he said.
Paclick says that Pelto's connection is most important to the President of the Plzen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation known as a powerful lobbyist who has the ability to influence the vote of the delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclic, it is so unacceptable that Pelta becomes president.
"If he wins, the current state is preserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a trusted trader, football wouldn't make it even more," Paclík said.
It also suggests that Pelt's name was heard in courts years ago in the investigation of corruption affairs, but Pelt came out without punishment.
"I don't know what the prestigious football would bring to Pelt's victory."
“And how would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclík, who has already taken over his former statement that he would “sell the Plymouth club if Pelta became president.”
If Paclík would triumph in the Thursday election, he and Pelta would be able to imagine future cooperation.
He also considers another candidate Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík in front of the bright wave assembly, which ended with the fiash.
"He would be the first to go after."
"He has great abilities."
“I could imagine him as the boss of the representation.”
"But managers wouldn't manage the association."
"I also don't crash my nose where I don't know," said Paclík, who in September drew great attention by standing behind the appeal of the Arbitration Commission in front of Ludwig Macelou, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
He said he was going to troufl on the board of the association.
She refers to her ability to manage private companies, since last summer, Plzni, who with his support celebrated the Premier League triumph in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"Abych has limited the influences of some interest groups, which need to tend to influence the disciplinary and appealing committee, which is treated to unpleasant situations," said Paclík, who does not have their antipathy, for example, to Spartan boss Daniel Krétinisz.
One of the priorities he would also consider the enriching relationships of the FAČR with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby with political tops in order to get more money from the lottery tax into sport.
“It’s one of the key things the new president should devote.”
“If gambling taxes occur, as political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but at the level they have to say where the money will go,” he said.
As a burden now, Paclík does not even take his connection to the Plenny Club, whether he himself claims that the President of FAČR should be "super-party".
Pelta is again associated with Jablonce, Rajchl with Prague Duke.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any sense of transferring my shares to someone in a Plenzin club and back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promises new FAČR opinions that would exclude election pat
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, the FARC would have new positions that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablon official is optimistic before Thursday’s negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election struggle is significantly influenced by the possible success of today’s football representation.
Pelta promised before the unveiled election in January that it would focus on the representation and gain of funds in the event of the election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the previous wave assembly, so a two-month delay could fit him to defend and present his ideas about football management in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expecting the president to meet on Thursday."
"He feels it's the highest time to lead the association," the man, who is associated mostly with the Apple club, but who has been working in Sparta for several years and the Executive Committee of the Union.
He also believes he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that under the current election problems there is the euphoria that ruled during the reign of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, on the June General Assembly, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they did not allow different interpretations, we have had the president since September," Pelta said.
The re-elaboration of the most important document of the Citizen Association was regarded as a secretary to the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
“It’s a principle that we can’t be without,” Pelta says.
He continues to try not to limit himself to his opponents.
He had previously announced that he was able to imagine cooperation with Jindr Rajch, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well knows that his anti-candidacy would be his first vice president.
He did not attack Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, on the contrary, left a nid dry on Pelt.
"Something is moving in football over a year, he has already gained some success."
"But his attacks were unworthy and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign in a way."
"And so many of them are now doubting his real character," Pelt said to an opponent's address, who says remains loyal to the announcements he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, according to him, is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
That should be an interpreter of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemian caution or the sounds of the last corruption scandal."
“I’d like to talk to the private and public sector immediately to ensure enough money for the entire football,” said TKK, a sixty-four-year-old candidate, two months ago.
He also promised his arrival in the front of football wouldn't mean any personal cleaners.
"I must first get acquainted with the full-time individual employees," he said to Strahov, where the long-term uncontrolled nervousness is over.
Despite today’s catastrophic scenarios, they believe that the delegates will not go unnecessaryly to Nymburk on Thursday.
"If it is the only controversial point of how it will be voted in the third round, then we will be able to transfer it."
"Football needs trust and only gets there by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days ago, possibly a decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that FAČR will start working hard under him.
If the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic was elected to the Thursday General Assembly by Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Rajchhal promises that in the event of his election, he will start working hard.
He wants to carry out systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemians’ case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that former President Ivan Hašek had initiated.
"As a president, I would like to dedicate football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," said Rajchl in an interview with the TKK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to certain areas.”
"And I'm going to distribute hard tasks to make football a milestone step forward in every segment."
“Some people would probably not make it happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he would not apply again.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know that it will have a sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw my legs under the legs and question every step of my way,” he explained.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because then others would give up."
"It's a trust I can't just take," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started with Hash.
"There's been a big piece of work in those two years, and I don't want to miss it now."
"The processes are initiated, which will have a sound in just a few years, and I wouldn't like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that if another candidate Miroslav Pelty was elected, the situation could return to the union before the Hague.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's what I think Mirek Pelt can't do."
"There are people behind him that would make football so that it would be only for those chosen."
"I can count a lot of things, but it's definitely not that I'm a party."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just your choices," Rajchell said.
He also rejected the claim that he would be only a Czech president.
“Although some people try to claim the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Morav.”
"For example, it is time to think about the second league being divided into a Czech and Moravia part whose winner would go into the first league."
"It would not be such a situation that there are only three Moravia totals in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Morava," Rajchl said.
Since he was also involved in the fight for the president, the Chief of Plenny Club Tomáš Paclík, Rajchl is not willing to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber that chose me to be his vice president and see that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers the saving of tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, television contracts and lottery law negotiations.
On the contrary, he feels guilty that the bond isn't pushing for a single break.
While Pelt declares he is "disqualified from returning to Czech football trust," the second of Paclic's competitors is considered a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzni for that year."
"If he was elected, he would probably continue in the matters that Ivan Hašek started here and would not fundamentally change personal inclusion in commissions."
"He wouldn't want to crush it for his benefit," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
The blue jump
Julia Stanek
From the view of Uphon, a quiet swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels in Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after visiting cities or traveling, let his tired legs rest in the thermal bathrooms.
The book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder appeared in the last one and a half year on the discovery road, her luggage could not be missed: her swimming.
Leaping the mark on the water, she looked up to the artificially formed copulations, swim opposite the marble pockets (positions of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for it on the edge of the pool and admiring carefully restored seashores.
If some shipyard liked her, she put it in her record – even with remarkable details about the way of building and the history of the building.
In this way, more than 200 swimming pools explored the historical architecture of Meder and presents it now in its new book "Badefreuden (Badefreuden)": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic castle swimming in Schwarzwald, "The hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunusu.
It was led by its "Travel for the Most Unusual Baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries: Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Croatia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of marine culture.
With sport, it doesn't move too much, Meder says - it's just something different in the water.
It’s just the fact that swim fans must satisfy the blue cattle and the smell of chlorine, while healthy runners can breathe the slight smell of the dead forests or listen to the joyful birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the shipyard really must always be so cute," said Ms. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started gathering beautiful swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Driving in the Scandinavian swimming pool and etheric oils for sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so big that it applies to all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders try to, they can be a real pest for the eyes: "The place of the floor has a man in the bathwater level."
"It is also transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: high sleeve, pests of cage, jumping brushes.
The small-format image link "Badefreuden" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oasis of wellnes - but primarily stimulates the taste of jumping into the blue.
An incredible copy was discovered by the collector of Ms. Meder in his search in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful medical baths, like 100-year-old Széchenyi in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original crash cave (deep bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, the pools are filled with alkalic water and the Jaszbers are located in the t building.
With a beautiful view of the opposite, there are many heated swimming pools under the whole sky in Switzerland and Austria. While a man has a Curysian rooftop bath area in the eyes of the whole city, in the outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton the baths are viewed with the snow, which is covered by the Arlberg, and the Arlberg, which is in the footstep.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool is expected by the swimming pool guests in Längenfeld: Akvapark Ötztal looks like ufo, which just landed in the Alps.
From the top of the three open springs in the winter, the steam rises up to the sky, while at the back of the mountains of Ötztalu.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector of Ms. Meder smells five chlorines in the pond.
Many thermal baths are felt after the seed, in the Arpads of the Hungarian Békescsabá baths it smells after the hot oil to the extent that a person hardly believes that he has entered the treatment baths.
The smell comes from medicinal water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose seats ulcer on the skin as soon as a person enters the pool - a slightly special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also one of the most disappointed places in search of beautiful baths: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate bath Luhačovice, she hit on a closed area.
In 1902, the bath was closed by the architect Dushan Jurkovich.
When Ms. Meder looked at the windows of the red-white-yellow secession buildings, she saw the grain growing significantly between the plates.
The destruction was built in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths already have three phases of construction behind themselves; one can discover not only new-Roman elements that come from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Maurity Hall in the style of Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bathplace of Mrs. Iris Meder’s swimming pool expert, not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a sort of performance, connecting so diverse building structures to such a wonderful complex," Mrs. Meder says.
In such a palace, the flood into the thermal pool is apparently a extreme issue.
Agriculture speculation
Deutsche Bank Leaves to Verify Commodity Trading
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its agricultural raw materials trade?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the boss of the company wants to make the consequences.
Hamburg
For federal citizens, it is clear: 84% of Germans, according to one study, consider it unacceptable to speculate banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of the questionnaire even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to leave the trade because the world’s poorest problems are deepening.
This is the result of a Forsa survey from the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report made by Foodwatch in mid-October.
According to the author Harald Schumann, betting on global commodity stock exchanges raises prices and banks therefore bring co-finance to the global hunger issue.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at the Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were thought to ensure that traders were insured against price change.
However, in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants with interest in high-risk trades have deferred from the offer and demand - and achieved profits on account of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the U.S., Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised that he would check and said that no trade is "worthy to make a good reputation of the Deutsche Bank given in the bet".
According to information, SPIEGEL ONLINE is controlled by the International Working Group of Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the checks will be closed, and the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board, along with the recommendation of how it should be loaded.
At the end of January, the leaders of the banks want to tell the consequences.
At the end, there may be a reduction in commodities trade or even a total rejection.
Ackermann is working with his own image.
Foodwatch's Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened its criticism of the financial sector: "Letting food prices rise shows particularly drastic how unlike the bank today harms the overall prosperity."
Let Ackermann as the highest bank lobbist have a duty.
"The Deutsche Bank has to cut out all items for which money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view appears at first glance as a surprise, but it is clear that the group boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he left the office.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the head of the board would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By deviating from controversial agricultural speculation, it could improve its image.
And you don't have to worry about possible losses - you should finally consult his successor.
Each other would say investment in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Fors Institute questioned 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Accordingly, 11 percent considers it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments associated with betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was participating in such trades: each other would, as a result of the survey, report all the investments in which money is deducted into the speculation of raw materials.
43% would warn known before such a bank, 49% said he was thinking of canceling his account and going to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Movement pavilon
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The history of architecture with tops, falls and happy ends: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 gained awards, became a Vienna must, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now open again as an exhibition house.
When it is worn for modern archaeological architecture, for bright shapes, glass halls, brave dishes and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a magnificent and famous example.
The Schwanzer pavilon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and resilient steel and glass structure.
The building has yet to be considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
The architect celebrated that he also built Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-wheeled BMW palace plus as a key to its side building in Munich, he finally celebrated internationally in 1973.
His temporary exhibition building, designed pavilion after the world exhibition, was placed in Schweizer Garten at the Vienna Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - was called the "House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for museums, either spatially or technically - there were missing walls for enclosure of artistic exhibitions, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the contemporary art came into the new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has grown more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz pavilon has renovated, now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a significant career, e.g. in youth krasobruslar, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has earned a significant reconstruct of the money for politicians and monuments and the public, for the guards and guards.
In addition to contemporary art, the work of Fritze Wotruby's scholar should be exhibited by the same name foundation, a cafe and library should be established, and office buildings should be built for this purpose.
strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then an ideal occupation.
Not only that he sensibly reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s secession buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was “a very important place” for him, where he “almost every weekend” looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which already lost his greatness and ease when he moved to Vienna and changed his use.
The building was a "catapult for energy", said Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used by the glass fiber, insulated glass, and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge-stainless steel nozzles were reinforced or exchanged, and asbestos-filled ceiling was sanified.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, the launched lighting channel between the building and the street gains lighting, the entrance leads to the mosque - almost a new building, but still a challenging Schwanzer pavilon.
The original entrance doors remained retained, the building is covered in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
The cinema is exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the Memorial Office and low budget.
"It often had to be found material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental office," Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken floor of the suterene.
Over all pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult to say that with the pavilion, "who came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-History", said recently.
Such architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "revealed appropriate self-confidence".
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in an inappropriate place, since there has been a happy urban accident: in the circle around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter near Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And maybe another happy accident: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as they can hear, already negotiates with the neighbourhood town in Switzerland Garten.
The road plans a package for the winter crisis of a million
The road has deployed a crisis plan to prevent rail failures in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter train losses and delays, Deutsche Bahn issued more than €70 million this year, according to a report in newspapers.
The "Bild" newspapers have submitted a preliminary report calling for the internal group plan that it is calculated by 2015 with a total of around 300 million euros.
It is said that the use of trains and rail networks should also be achieved in extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees per 16,000 people is planned to eliminate snow on rail facilities and landing grounds.
The aim is to get rid of the starting point and 90 per cent for the operation of the necessary deviations within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Rudiger Grube's chief was warned after a meeting at the highest level with government and industry leaders from delays of trains and delays during the winter.
In the past winter, the road had significant problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it had a lack of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Office.
In addition, it comes to delays for ICE trains
The road is also unable to manage over the years that ICE train repairs have more likely to be allowed to control partially when one ICE train occurred at the main station in Köln.
Deutsche Bank Pays a Million Penal in the United States
After the launch of boss Josef Ackermann, there are new tramps in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of compensation there.
As if the Deutsche Bank hadn’t had enough problems at home, it has reached its past in the U.S.: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million in one balance sheet (EUR 106 million) to resolve disputes over the bankruptcy of five large affiliate banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage letters.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a number of large banks that joint banks have made false promises to buy financial products; that risks are approximately reduced.
Such papers lost significantly in value during the crisis and threw banks with them into the collapse.
“We are pleased that we could solve the issue without having to draw the party to court,” said the spokesman of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank does not accept any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to paying $2.0.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the attention of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and helps in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to get compensation for billion damages.
Now the end-of-compensation is the first of its kind.
The regulator also joined other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
These are the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became a lot of financial companies fateful.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the US-Investment Bank Lehman Brothers changed his mind.
Although the incident occurred a few years ago, the banks are now blowing a strong wind in the streets.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous complaints to obtain corrections or have made doubts.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of complaints.
It relates to 18 international big banks that two state financers engaged in the property Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the sales of $200 billion in mortgage.
The Deutsche Bank must also face the FHFA appeal, which is more trades in a total value of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "essential losses" without specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank has rejected claims as unsubstantiated and said he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billions
Financial guru Buffett is investing significantly in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has purchased more than $10 billion shares.
Until now, US investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers as long-term developments will only allow the company to predict difficulties.
However, he has now read IBM's business reports and changed his views on investments in the industry.
A long time ago, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and develops computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffetta’s investment is considered to be a rider passing in the financial world.
As a consequence, it is now called the mattress IBM "Sir IBM".
Buffett has announced at the U.S. CNBC economic radio station that has purchased IBM shares of $10.7 billion since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5.5 percent share.
Buffett said that IBM hadn't known anything about his commitment yet.
He praised the management that tried for the economic crisis even for good income.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has long bet on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computer centers.
A more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice and powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has avoided technology firms until today.
He argues that he invests only in businesses whose activities also understand.
Instead, Buffett was able to carry the cargo rail, the manufacturer of lubricants or the production of machines.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway, along with about 80 own subsidiaries, has also shared in a number of large-scale groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rück.
The 81-year-old master took over a small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and built it with smart investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, his way of life is modest.
This is why it is a cultural character for many investors around the world.
His almost unfair sense of making money brought him the overname "Orakel from Omaha" (Orakel from Omaha).
When Buffet’s investment became known, IBM shares rose by one percent before the storm began.
The Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock market and is considered to be the world’s most valuable technology companies with Apple and Microsoft.
In Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to play.
The founder Bill Gates is his confidential friend.
The threat is fatiguable
After the discovery of "Cells in Zwickau" the Turkish media doubts about the German rule of law.
The newspapers even talk about “blood ideology,” which is now living again.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
The report was reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many of the German Turks, this returns the fear, which has long been deemed dead: from the war attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right extremist background.
There is no doubt that xenophobia is in Germany.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals the scope of which the dimensions have not been taken into account for a long time.
"Is He Lives Blood Ideology Again?" the titles of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, Sabah newspapers emphasize that one of the offenders should be a secret police agent of the Constitutional Protection Office and fear that German authorities could also be included in the right radical base.
Turkey responded thoroughly to Germany: she remembered the weekend of a demonstration of silence in front of the Brandeburg Gate of the victim of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalls the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish settlement agreement.
In joyful colors, a common life was marked - as a history of success.
As a box here the report of several Turkish media: "Germany's 50's support" is the title of an article on the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, publishing the "Hürriyet" paper for Germany can't take it in order to avoid this connection of thought.
"It starts to crash," the title of the column sounds from Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people killed who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is the process of police and its late success in search in the German Internet forums.
Why did the German authorities not think much earlier to pursue suspects in the right extremist circles, the authors were amazed.
As a result, many are at least rhetoricly urgent to use the drastic means: “If the activity continues to be carried out so superficially here, there will be nothing else to immigrants but their own defense and arms.”
“This will be the best self-defense.”
"The quality of clarification and proportionality of punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany," Selen writes.
What means if internal peace is threatened in Germany, assaults in Mölln and Solingen were explained in the 1990s.
Photography of the combustion site in Solingen is deeply immersed in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
Because no other event has shown to the Turks living here more clearly that there is a threat to the Germans and that discredit and departure can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks on the side of the Turks made a sense of mutuality more visible.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after murder: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the attack in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish president, but left himself to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkelem - Kinkel calculated at the time in his speech what fees were handed over by the Turks.
It was as if the value of a person was measured according to the amount of his tax.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the lack of trust in many German Turks in the state arrangement here.
In addition to an extensive effort to clarify and a new assessment of the right-wing extreme terrorism in Germany, it requires open words this time.
Scandinavian banking at the Cury Lake
The most successful bank of Europe does not have its headquarters in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered almost bankruptcy from the financial crisis and has been closing from one to another since then.
Now some German has to compare it.
That's what Axel Weber didn't mean.
After his noisy departure from the head of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that it will arrive in 2013 in almost the same spectacular new employment: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in a career.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for both its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and told friendly notes to future colleagues.
"The UBS reaches the turnover."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would happen completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London has rounded all bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a recognized banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board has also been fired since then - and everyone wonders: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been known that Weber banks have been advised since February 2012.
And the presidency of the Board of Directors will be transferred in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's going to be hard.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and emissions banker, and he would certainly need time to work.
We will then take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved it deserves the title “The Bank of the Greatest Scandinavian in Europe”
Because UBS is equally huge - until recently it has been the largest asset manager in the world - and it is also closing for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, the Swiss bank won't be saving.
It started with the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputation.
An image of a quiet and solid, but also an asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
UBS 2007, on one hand, managed $1.6 billion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she became an investment bank to the world’s largest banks league.
It was an impression.
The former banker and later professor of banking at Curychu Hans Geiger said: "I always referred to my students at the time as a pattern of a good bank."
From today’s point of view, someone asks, “How could I just be wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was the first time that something in UBS had failed properly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and also genial banker, resigned.
A few months later, he was surprised why he left.
The bank's investment division has killed Subprime papers and had to reject billions.
In order to achieve this, UBS announced an increase in capital of 13 billion franks.
Hence, he found investors, however, whose nose would have recently been ashamed: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that a person had not known his name.
But it was just the first time.
This was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, resigned in 2006, the second best-paid Swiss Board of Directors.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood due to its wrong investments in the financial crisis against breakdown and had to be rescued by the state.
National Bank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on compulsory exchangeable bonds for which she could become a co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was frightened because it noticed how dramatic it was for a small country when it had such large banks on its territory.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times higher than the Swiss economy’s performance (see picture).
"We couldn't save UBS again," Banking expert Geiger said.
The first disaster is based on the second.
For a few months, UBS has been in a fiscal dispute with America and has expressed its willingness to issue the data of wealthy customers who, as possible, cut taxes through the help of the banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million – such as returning unlawful profits from these trades, including penalties.
This made UBS more or less openly knowing that it contributed to taxation.
At the same time, she lost something that has been long-lasting with her capital in a rich customer competition: a discretionary sacrament.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret has no longer existed as before.
Following the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of the money of the customers.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking because of bad speculation and in the management of assets for helping in tax infringement.
And just when it was a little clear again, just when it was thought that UBS was recovered again, this unfortunate business analysis comes here: The only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And that’s clear: with investment banking risk management, it’s obviously still not guilty.
"Adoboli's approach has probably found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and Finanz professor in finance at the Banking Institute at Zurich University.
The financial director of the big German bank also said: “UBS’s problem is that it cannot control risks.”
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of caution that Swiss bankers long ago surpassed to become the guards of the world’s large assets: no too high risks, so the security for money - the Alpine republic also broke the world again.
Swiss bank treasures have become a symbol for unfair reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high quality chocolate.
The UBS centre in Curychu is still suitable for the climbing good Swiss private banks - it is just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Bahnhofstraße, Kurdish, which leads directly to the lake of Kurdish, which is covered by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, renting shops belong to one of the highest in Europe.
The Tiffany's clenotism is located here among the Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli sugar.
For centuries, Swiss banks are based here: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
UBS enters the reception hall with heavy rotary doors.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, there are huge leather chairs in front of them, next to the bank's logo, a large direction to the "seif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss banks of both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, sometimes have oppressed or betrayed, according to the boss of one of the small private Swiss banks.
His name would prefer not to read in newspapers, eventually closes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks stores.
UBS is probably too larger, he says, especially in investment banking, where the Anglosases also expanded.
The Swiss don’t have anything to say anymore.
"And if so, they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking industry that UBS changed, initially brought it to high profits and then to a penalty: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Swisser Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"On Wednesday, the government coalitions of a small seven-million country have moved to the largest rescue action in their nation's history," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or about €45 billion, were approved by politicians to save from the bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If you are talking to Swiss bankers, you see a problem mainly in UBS size.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks joined a huge group.
A bank, which was already too large in small Switzerland at the time of the merger, was still growing.
At the same time, the two different UBS banking predecessors complemented: One rich but sleeping bank in Curychu with hardship in the management of assets and poorer, but internationally stronger involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came advantageously to a lot of money, with which they could deploy a large roulette.
With this UBS rise, two names are associated: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 UBS Group Chief and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a team of futures,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, a person who controls feelings around the stomach that has developed from banking sciences entirely upwards."
But Ospel said he relyed on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made decisive mistakes at the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: the pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the ownership of senior employees, on which Wuffli's group boss repeated the same password: Slash Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She stated "League Tables", an agenda that documents the success of the banks at that time.
UBS tried to find the location at the top of it.
A few steps have happened to her.
In the exchange and shares trade, the game took part at the top.
However, business advisors who have been entrusted emphasize one weakness: in international interest trading, in the statement of bankers “Fixed Income”, there is probably a large deviation behind the largest banks.
UBS has some misconceptions in U.S. hypothetical products.
In order to close this lake, UBS committed itself to an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and the fund based on risk assurance in the US investments of Subprime.
She developed into a powerful machine that overpacked securities on American hypothetical loans and transferred further - while leaving herself a risk too.
Even when the other banks have long been looking for an exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," bank expert Geiger said.
The larger euphoria, so deep down.
One manager had to leave after the other when attempts to clean up were more difficult than they thought.
UBS’s positions have become a catapult seat, and so far they have become foam.
Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost uncontrollable job.
They have to find a strategy for a bank that has disappeared all the nearby business models.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: Ending with investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go so far.
But investment banking needs to be strongly blown, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present the world's future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually understood only as a transitional solution when the bank surprisedly divorced with the predecessor of Grübel.
In the meantime, he passed: He has long runs UBS stores, the Cury Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's her?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber already asks.
Publicly, however, she just says she'll find her lady's apartment in Curychu.
Next year.

Warren Buffett’s legend of investment just confirmed this view: In a CNBC interview, he said that it would not be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
This is why it is probably too early in its view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for several decades and entered the U.S. technology industry.

Intelligent gateways expand in cities
In many places, havres are considered to be "problem birds": however, these highly intelligent animals can’t be expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Gates have been a picture of the city for centuries, however, in some municipalities, people are accumulating complaints of impurity and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no means yet to be supervised against “problem birds”.
The prisoners of the field may no longer be able to get out of town, experts have announced on the first symposium of East Africa's gateways.
There, experts from all over the federal territory have consulted on possible eastern areas.
Looking for alternatives in cities
At the same time, natural defenders also brought out the problems of the cities from the exodus of particularly protected hedges of the field: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional areas of life.
Prosecution, growing construction and planting of typical trees for birds make life harder.
The doors are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 pairs of snow are amongst other things in the Western Seest, northwestern, including in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim at Bremen and Leer.
There was a 2005 disputed mass murder project in the rural district of a negative title.
Critics labeled the catch of animals in birds and slaughter crashes for particularly brutal.
"Normal excitement, excitement, brings nothing," said the urbanist and landscaped Werner Klöver from Leer.
The removal of bowls by spraying water or drying trees often has adverse effects, also said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahru in Badensku-Württemberg.
"The animals fall down, large colonies climb and divide into other places."
Fear is thoughtable only as an exception to hospitals, retired homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't leave them anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the city problem cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is thoughtful that the combination of excretion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their attraction to live in other places.
"The information table instead of chain drinks" promoted against that psychologist and ethnologue Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "We can finally stop one killing in the face with self-confidence."
Ms. Jürgens co-foundered the Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg scientific return path, providing information tables for life-threatening high-smart field heaviness.
In the meantime, the project is already accepted by tourists.
Also, on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs. Jürgens had his own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and intelligence of the animals are legendary: Havrai fields do not only use the aid to reach the pilgrimage, but they even build their instrument as a help.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested behaviour on four fields, how far bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that the stones had to bring down the structure to reach the larvae.
Without a great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause a collapse of the surface.
In the second attempt, the anointed doors had to solve a more welding problem.
In the vertically constructed war, the investigators placed a small tank with a larva mould.
The birds couldn’t reach their wing.
However, the researchers put them in pieces of wire.
All four animals were made up of beans, with the help of which as a striker hunt was hunted from a tube of a tank for a container.
Three out of four field havres even managed to do this with a sequel.

Mask at personal level
The emotionally powerful new book of Peter Englund, entitled Beauty and Shame: The Secret History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), begins with such a long list of characters that come to your head.
One advice to keep yourself up at this moment: Cut this page carefully and make a label from it.
In the novel story of Mr. Englunda, you will be familiar with all the people, and this list will serve you as a navigation - like a magician - at times when you will feel confused and lost in different situations as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new place at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite strictly, as an "antihistoric work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost misses ambassadors, energy journalists and tactics and equipment discussions.
It’s not even a book about what happened, explains the author, rather than “a book about what it was.” It’s mainly about “feelings, insights, experiences and moods.”
"Beauty and sadness" combines in itself war experiences of more than 20 dozens of men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to rushers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others will become war prisoners, come to end, go crazy, or die.
Their lives are shining like flames of candles burned in the church - new ones are added to the destiny, while others are extinguished.
The book of Mr. Englund differs from classical historical novels.
It corrects the idea that the First World War was just about the horrific battles of the West Front.
"Beauty and sadness" manually explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve the problems with the fact that bees fall on them, they must spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids or face the presence of much tse-tse.
Almost from the beginning it’s a very impressive reading.
The war slaughtered people's lives as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling fire dust.
When a remote shooting starts to be called from work, and you are a woman who is home with your children, will you escape or stay?
Who's actually getting closer to that?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, even why the whole war has been dissolved.
"The vacuum resulting from a lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with hopes, assumptions, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fames."
"Beauty and sadness" follows stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young navy serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are overwhelmed from biography, letters and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound terrifying and appealing, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are completely alive and credible.
Many of them are talking about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Please, everywhere the same replacement."
"Coffee hardness, aluminum simulation, rubber imitation, paper bonds, wooden buttons."
It is further treated and describes food replacements in Germany.
It is referred to as "meat made of liscious rice cooked in bovine fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, shoes with wooden irritants."
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat replacements in the production of bowls and 511 registered coffee replacements".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American finds within himself the inner populism of wildlife and brutality, as he declares about the war: "You will finally understand that this is the human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, civilizational news or good book."
In contrast, the British soldier realizes that he will soon die and no one will notice it even if he's struggling.
"When a person finally agrees with sacrificing himself, he would at least expect that this would happen before the vision of a grateful audience," he wrote.
Instead, it looks like “a judge who will secretly defeat him.”
Other notes relate to the departure of old Europe and the emerging of new horrors.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition and a competitive struggle," says Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he said, "a new beast of the following century: a glorious and ideologically enclosed mass killer in dresses that are standing in peace, who executes his bloodlessness without rising from the table."
People behave totally unexpectedly, but foolishness changes with hero.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately attempted to catch some sexual illness from a prostitute to avoid the front service.
“The most important example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcus that soldier purchased and swept for him genitals in the hope of ending in the hospital,” he wrote.
"The desperate people hit him in the eyes, which often blinded him for the rest of his life."
In this Swedish translation from Peter Gravese, the prose of Mr. Englund is confused, but it does not prove that it is greatly fit to his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way the war “resolved totally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to ask why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books on the First World War were mostly working with tags, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussella or novels as "On the West Front of Peace" by Erich Marii Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers a non-conventional concept.
His book has the most devastating endings that no era has in popular educational literature.
But I will not give it to you.
But you will look like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, pulled the page out of the list of heroes from your hand and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time per minute exactly planned race
She took part in hundreds of police officers, some of whom were used in street concerns.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti park should be almost empty at that time.
No one knew about the action except a few highly built officers. The second was first said that it was a exercise.
The head of the action was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
They should not repeat cases of recent weeks when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department, and in addition, the wave of public sympathy overthrowed the side of the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation, aimed at cleaning Zuccotti Park from demonstrators, began after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were allowed to inspire operations in other cities.
Massive exercises for behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island part, which was preparing for an action at Zuccotti Park.
The leaders reinforced the so-called training to suppress anxiety - anti-terrorism measures that include the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - by focusing on the city's Lower Manhattan part.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "in the last minute" by someone who originally explained the action only as "working".
"I know a few police officers who were also invited to this event, and nobody told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person who spoke only provided that they remained anonymous.
"The fact that they were going to Zuccotti Park knew only the highest position of the department membership."
One of the reasons for the secret was the lesson that the city had once received.
On October 14, the city leaders planned to clean the park, but then resigned from the plan, as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they joined them in the park before the operation began.
Final events took place by police from various units, including intervention groups from around the world - dozens of police who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day he comes to the park and a lot of people leave again, so one hour in the night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It would be appropriate to do so at the time when there will be at least people in the park," he said.
Before the units arrived, the Pike Slip streets and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, were assembled on the borders of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
The light and feeding message from the amplions frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the ordinary units entered the park in their blue winds, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
Police say that until 1:45 a.m. there was no single tent, which wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things.
Other teams of police were slaughtered as they gathered at the edge of the park so that they could enter it if some arrest was needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, chief spokesman of the police department, said that it was so for their safety.
However, many journalists have the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and some police officers were behaving with them.
Mr. Browne argued that television cars on Church Street led by the west border of the park could play without any problems.
The police went westward and flocked with the dense disturbance of the personal objects of the Protestant, including luggage and icelit bags full of clothes, and they were driven out from the hygiene department, who immediately captured everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park, and documenting images appeared on the internet a while later.
The most stunning group of demonstrators fled close to the kitchen in their camp, located near the center of the park.
Some of them created a fireplace, and the police started their methodical arrest.
About 10 people in the center of the camp were attracted to each other.
And two people joined the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
The Emergency Service members were invited to cut down the slots.
Until 3:30 a.m. no arrests took place in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests took place due to the "organization of endurance and detention resistance," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, was the highest-built uniform officer of the department.
The operation was also personally involved in Phil T. Pulaski, the chief of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "not involved in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it would be necessary to call it.
On Cortlandt Street, the block north of the park, and on Pine Street, the block south of the park, were linked to the gates.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one place, police officers were kept, many of whom were equipped with shields, as they expel people beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most amazing events of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5 a.m., one demonstrator was arrested south of Pine Street, jumping on a police car headquarters, and several others who dropped air from the police shipping tyres.
In a moment, a piece of scratch came out of the dab.
At the end of the operation, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
The Union of Assistant Workers will appeal to the city for release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistant workers who came to work last month planned to appeal the city on Wednesday, arguing that dismissal was not necessary and that it was also a discrimination due to the unreasonable impact on schools visiting poor students.
The court is probably the last option left for the Committees in the District Council 37 in their efforts to revoke the decision of dismissal.
On the seventh of October, six hundred and seventy two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees who belonged to the city's worst-paid employees. Their releases were described as a salary by the city's leaders for the workmanship that he wanted to distribute in the spring, which he had not allowed access to the health care fund.
The representatives of the city categorically refused the charge.
On the meeting of the City Council last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said the release was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately argued that there was no specific dismissal in the budget.
The District Council 37 officials announced that they had already completed the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would appeal to it. On Wednesday, they were meeting a press conference, where they would formally announce a complaint to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The accused will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African Americans or Hispanics, as well as most other assistants who have come to work.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman of the city's law department, said that the city has not yet seen a complaint, and therefore it will not be expressed for individual charges.
According to the New York Times complaint proposal, trade unions focused on the numbers of dismissed in poor parts of the city, which wanted to support their claims of injustice; they assumed that the poor schools had become more assistants because they have been financially dismissed for a long time.
They point out that while schools in Staten Island did not depart at all and at least in Upper East Side only, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were employed and even 46 assistants were released in District 8 and 9 in Southern Bronx.
She recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem five out of eight assistants have lost their work, although it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says, "It is not a neighbourhood full of mobile parents who can obtain funds to compensate the deficit in the budget."
The budget of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also came to money when the city changed the way to calculate bonus funds for each registered poor student.
The committees argue, inter alia, that the directors of high schools could be confused in the way in which a document was written approving the release of parental coordinators.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to revoke the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of teachers from the school’s payment document to the database of available employees whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were released," the complaint said, "and not just moved to the database on the position of the available employees."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats at the Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
Before this, however, the revolution had to succeed, and the ruling dictator Muammar Kaddafi had to be arrested and killed and put an end to the United States.
On Tuesday, the Commission for International Relations of the Senate will decide on the statements supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCaine (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should congratulate Libyans on their successful uprising and the United States.
"We want to appreciate the courage of the Libyan people who started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"The two sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has yet to be easy.
During the summer, legislators from both sides have constantly negotiated with the White House on the text of a series of declarations to approve or reject the US military role in NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to different views of both political parties, so it was never voted in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures that would stop the financing of U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya was literally in legislative purification – Congress criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but his members did not obviously irritate it so much that they would stop supporting him in his actions.
At the end of the congress, further events took place.
The rebels won Tripolis in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations in its statement "congratulates Libyans for their disproportionate courage and admirable loving-kindness that they have spent in an effort to free their people" and "congratulates men and women of the US armed forces and their allies who have participated in the operation to protect the Libyan citizenship, and for their special organization."
The statement also confirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be divided into two-half, as it was when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was held by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party in the Commission.
Lugar's spokeswoman said Monday he had not seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
The Parliament will vote this week on the addition to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This action, promoted by Bob Goodlat (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning the budget or other theme to be voted by the whole House or Senate.
Other legislators have not yet been able to press their proposals to vote on their own, even though they have had a considerable effort.
Goodlatt's proposal is only one of the 68 constitutional supplements presented at the Congress and affected a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are only small changes to others.
Only in the House can be found at least 15 versions of the supplement on a balanced budget and another row that would like to "regulate federal expenditure".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially starting Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can praise themselves by their "authority".
The draft budget regulation, which was approved in August, requested that the Parliament and the Senate vote on the supplement to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 Senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an additive.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitation of the periods in which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be President.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a range of supplements that, among other things, would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an additional banning the marriage of couples of the same gender and an additional banning the burning of the state flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws in the event that two-thirds of the states will be opposed to them.
Although Congress members appear to be very active in designing various supplements, they do not significantly deduct from the average compared to previous flights.
At the 111th Congress, 77 add-ons were offered, while at the 100th Congress, 66 were offered.
Their activity is even bleached compared to the early 90s, when, according to statistics, the Senate libraries offered more than 150 additives every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last add-on, which was added - the 27th add-on - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Deluded, but not defeated," Gifford said in her first TV interview with the shooting.
Ten months after the shooter hit her at a public meeting with the voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on Monday evening on a national television, singing along with the wideway show's melody "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" to return to the Congress and declaring that she was more than standing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that making words still makes her trouble and needed help while walking.
The whole order documented her difficult re-convalescence, which was necessary for the injury caused by the ball, which trampled her in front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and went out of her head behind.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to the House to triumphally participate in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since January shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed, and sang - while describing her recovery as a "compliant".
When Sawyer asked her how she feels, she responded to Gifford's 40-year-old, "It's pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the clock special work of the 20/20 series, which was broadcast in the evening of the release of a new book, entitled "Gabby: The Story of Courage and Hope".
The Specialist watched the entire Gifford Reconquest since the shooting of January 8.
On videos recorded by Kelly during the first week, you can see Gifford's in a hospital bed with his head and a long sweat across the front.
While her husband encourages her, she can only raise one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured as she sits in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple activities.
Dinner with the head.
Explosion of the lips.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords spoke another word - "toast" when she asked for changes in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC stations show that a hard-roll role in recovering Gifford's music: Congressman sings on them along with the therapist on the melody to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During Gifford's interview, spending two hours of therapy a day, Sawyer announced that he didn't remember anything from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said Gifford had read the papers on the shooting until March 12, when he was asked who she was the sixth who was killed in the incident.
The shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where he is waiting for a trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"Many people have died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Great, horrible, horrible."
Kelly Sawyer announced that at one point his wife declared "I lost."
"So I told her: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You got a truck.
But you can do it, you can get together and get back stronger than ever before.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect.
The event was a gallery on Wall Street that brought millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their head.
Kid Rock sang a balad of power, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, flyers and sailors were traveling around him.
The glorious cloth rose up and threw up with excitement.
"Men and women serving the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who arranged the spring benefit.
At the evening of the celebration, the former chairman of the Committee of Staff Chiefs was also attended, but also Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units somewhat differently.
"They were all presented as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you're.
But what I saw wasn't a shame, it was a regret.
Thus, the totally opposite impressions only illustrate the weak relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is included in the honour of its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public behaves more and more like a person in the uniform.
"We're not victims at all," said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"Because it seems that the only way some people can support us is to put us into the role of unhappy souls."
This theme is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look unthankful or destroy relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face was much worse than the units that once returned from Vietnam.
As a result, most words of compassion are spoken in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of Colonel Mark Cancian returned from the fighting events where they served as members of the seafoot, their father warned them that people would look out of the army from two corners to their service.
From the point of view, some will feel respect and surprise, because they defeated enemies and visited exotic places.
However, he will be headwitched if "under the surface there is not a bad, violent veteran," Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took place in Washington after his return.
He argued that when he was looking for a job, some people who had talked with him unintentionally indicated whether he could resist the stress that was associated with his work in Washington soon after he returned.
“When you talk about your service, you need to count on negative reactions,” Cancian taught his sons.
Anxiety of the army is partly sourced from U.S. independence to wars.
Success in the battlefield only rarely reduces recognition in the country that has little consciousness of its own army and in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there is only little profit.
"As a nation, we no longer respect military heroes as usual for World War II," said Lieutenant-General David Barno, who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in the assembly.
Soldiers are named for the number of actions that have suffered, the number of friends that have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The army faces rising pressure to strike hard against rape
This week it will decide whether 28 women and men against the army will be initiated due to alleged inactivity in the case of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a complaint with hundreds of other applicants.
Elizabeth Lyman's first-class military was on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague, 25 years old, and was pregnant in the 11th week.
It happened in October 2008, and she went to the casseroes at the Miramar Air Base north of San Diego. After dinner with her friend hit her male colleague a beer car carton with 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her that she could drink a little bit in the room.
"I've got a light of warning in my head," Lyman said.
However, the Texasan parent completely ignored her opposition.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"It's from Texas," she said.
"I would listen to my instincts."
He claims that just a few minutes after entering her room, a man went to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will wait for the dictatorship of the hearing, which may have a historical impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will refer to whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his Judge Donald.
The accusation states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the prosecutor had 17 members at the time. However, in the following months, their number grew to 28 - 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually attacked by their colleagues in the army, and that the army also killed after any of these attacks.
Burke says he goes on the neck of the army's highest commanders, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are people in position that can prevent efforts to take action against such actions?
Burke also argues that at least 400 more survivors have been contacted since February, many of which could become part of further complaints in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than collecting all charges in this case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says herself - makes complaints in several different cases if it is necessary to avoid the pressure.
The defensive team of the Defence Ministry leads the US State Representative Neil MacBride, who, together with his colleagues, encouraged the case to reject.
Judiciary documents acquired by Newsweek deal with the defence strategy - it is in principle that current or former soldiers cannot appeal for injuries that have suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court regulation called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injury that the soldiers suffer from active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defense refused to express it.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women still cannot officially serve in battle, it’s only about speeches: in modern wars it’s hard to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women’s soldiers have played an increasingly significant role, especially in the field of communication with civil women in the war zone.
The result: 150 women's soldiers fell among these wars - two-thirds of them were directly in battle.
It is time for modernisation in the army, Burke explains.
He's not alone in his struggle, and besides her, there are three other law enforcement officers.
At Yale Law School, visitors of the Veteran Law Seminar are preparing a complaint for four major military academys for the alleged development of an atmosphere that supports hate for women.
Regardless of this, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects the foundations for their complaint against the army. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disturbances", which is allegedly found in the victims of rape, Women's Service, for example, has the Armed Forces of the Group of rape, for An's release as a activist.
In December, her group has already filed a complaint against a State organization for negotiations with the veterans, which is accused of discriminatory practices that should have been made in the process of requests for assistance by persons claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
The Congress presented nine separate proposals by a group of senators and members of both political parties and proposed a range of corrective measures.
According to the Defence Ministry’s Office for Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 incidents occurred in the year.
In a report issued in March, the number of suspects is also separated: 20 percent of the cases reported in the army in 2010, which is half compared to the civilian justice system.
The prosecutors in the case of Burke's representative describe the attacks only as the first of the entire series of traumas.
For example, the first-class army Lyman reported allegedly raped the military police for a few hours after it had to take place.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat details of her rape once a few different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the investigations necessary to determine the rape, and her bed was found the blood of an attacker - from the wound she had made to watch him.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman held a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she loved her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people were invited, as witnesses, to declare the reputation in the benefit of the alleged criminal who was finally released.
"I remember the day when the sentence was taken," Lyman said.
"I had the feeling that right there in the place of birth - with a shout I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I said to my commander: 'It was not his judgment.'"
Lyman ordered a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her personality disorder, which called her unfair.
In January 2010, the army was released without honor and therefore without entitlement to the defence.
Whether the case of Lyman and other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington’s Law University.
However, he notes, "At my point of view, they should be able to enter into the next phases of negotiations."
However, between them and the dictatorship is the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized from the first moment that the world has seen the light.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The army is behind several decades, because their duties are not to comply with the same level of motivating incentives and scary means.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
The change will only happen when good people will be willing to fight.
If it is not decided for their benefit in the hearing, Burkevoa, the lawyer of the applicants, will gather hundreds of others ready to file a complaint and begin to work on other cases relating to this subject.
“We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, from where there will be no reform,” he says.
Or until we die, according to what comes earlier.
The Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became a new face of right extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant opinions on the internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to the killing in July, after which 77 dead were left in Norway, took part in his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in the cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time at the computer, he chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right group on social networks.
After the tragedy of this year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find it?
It’s easy to go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting it is not really so difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent British research team report on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so widespread, Bartlett says that scientists are sufficient to simply use ads on websites and, thanks to this, fully accurately identify the searched demographic group - something that marketing workers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team across Europe found half a million fans of right groups, focusing on them and sending them ads. However, instead of calling them into the newly created group or offering them some dietary products, they’ll call them to fulfill their questionnaire regarding their optimism and their relationship with the future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
“It’s a completely new way of conducting research,” Bartlett said.
Some of the results are not just so surprising: online right-wing groups are in the middle of young men who undermine the growing level of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hiding behind the computer screen."
Working with the DEMOS team is just one of the examples of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and politicians use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends covering status updates, wall posts and pressing buttons "I like it".
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide three different data on average a day, which makes this social network literally a “information supernova” that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, in which the name of Facebook, has increased compared to the state of nearly 800% five years ago.
For some scientists, Facebook’s magic is giving them the opportunity to study people without having to disturb them somewhere in the street.
"In the past, when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go to a side where you’d never be left,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook takes away all of this - you're just going straight to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify a social-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who picked up their drunken performances on Facebook were much more threatened by the problem of alcoholism than students who silenced this topic.
Moren suggests that the students’ teammates of the site monitor and come with the offer of helping a student who publishes too many opium status.
"The problem cannot be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren, and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development of Children at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
“We have found a way to identify threatened children that we shouldn’t have a chance to discover.”
Facebook is constantly surveying the data of its users.
The information team has developed statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, the 2010 election participation and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly with the use of the information they had access - the defenders of internet freedom have long argued that the page should make its information fund available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the page is watching whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend, a thousand kilometers away, the page needs to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data are accessible to everyone.
“I think most users didn’t even think that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a London Knowledge Lab sociolog, about a 2006 study conducted using their students’ public Facebook walls.
"If it was about them, they read it so that there is only information between them and their friends."
It is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even in off-line research there is no guarantee that the entity is totally honest.
On Facebook, it is not possible to verify how much information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you’re doing outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, believes that the towel and the recorder are still the best possible tool to be used in research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something you can’t replace,” he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and the fuck a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public court transfer
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "rebellion" fighter during his first court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and between the Norwegian temple riders," he said in a court where 500 people gathered.
"I oppose the court because the mandate has been given to you by organizations supporting hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I confess my deeds, but I do not confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik stopped during this monology because "he didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could announce his opinions."
For the same reason, Breivick, who brought a ready speech with him, refused to allow him to speak to his relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited any media contact for four shades and announced that the competent authorities would have complete control over all of his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some came in the hope that Breivick’s power would be able to look into the eyes, others to make sure they were kept firmly under the lock.
Everyone participated in order to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," said one of the surviving attacks to the NRK commentator.
"It was nothing pleasant, but I can say to myself that after I saw and heard the suspicious, I went mentally a little further."
Breivik, in dark clothes and blue cravate, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, and when he arrived and left the building, he couldn’t be able to look at the present journalists, even surviving in the eyes.
Despite Breivick's strange idea of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge noted that he was not crazy, and noted that there was no proof that he had a co-worker.
For someone, it may be comforting that the attacks on June 22 appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the shame and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I would like it to look like a beast, but it's not so," said one of the victim's relatives.
"If so, it would be much easier."
7 Lessons from Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in a Movie Going to Cinema this Week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him with Henry Ford began to appear and chose him to be his geniality as the greatest modern inventor.
In a recent re-discovered Jobs interview, which was released for a special film that goes to the cinema this week, it will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind fully understands the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an incredible designer, a dreamer and a self-known member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who put every little bit into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered "the most important idea that 90 percent of their work is really a great idea... [but] the most consistent idea between the excellent and the most consistent product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV series Triumf of Computer Crazy, which talked about the sound of personal computers. During the recording, he played a unique, more than an hour interview.
It was a decade since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and had full hands working with his new NeXT computer company, and he was patiently looking at how wide public accepts the Internet.
In the TV series, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used, and the original copies of the interview were traditionally lost during transportation.
However, shortly after Job’s death, VHS’s copies were found in the garage.
This material, slightly cut, is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which goes into selected films Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has asked for his unpleasantness to provide longer conversations, Jobs acts as surprisingly excited that he can discuss his technological philosophy and business strategies.
It also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking when to see how Jobs’ answer is perfectly thinking to make it the most excited and accurate possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism is on the surface, when Cringely’s questions act intolerantly and motivate him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was recorded before Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are even terribly prophecies when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and wrong, offering their own vision of the future on the field of computer technology.
One thing is reading Job's career post-mortal reviews, but Jobs, which we see here as a deep dream in the bloom of his geniality, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things can and should look.
It took a long time, and after he expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How to manage a business:
"During the years of business, I always asked: 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: 'Well, that's just how it's done.'
Nobody knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about businesses.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe its efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused with the way the costs were recorded - often began with the inscription "standard costs", the amount of them could only be thought of. At that time he decided to express his own way - he developed an automated tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs within a moment.
How he did the pope’s rainbow:
Jobs recalls the "Wisdom Box" built by Steve Wozniak - a device that enables people to effectively enter a phone company and call free anywhere in the world.
A series of things have already been written about this device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm, when the Blue Box describes it as a tool of power, is literally infectious.
He tells us how the devices tested with Wozniak using a paid phone, and during the call they left to switch from one AT&T network to another, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a time we've broke this way around the world, so when we've shouted something to the paid phone, it's called a minute later from the other phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
“We were young and found that we were able to build a thing that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.”
We both made a small thing that was able to control much bigger work – it was an incredible experience and I think it would never be destroyed by Apple without it.
Jobs continues to describe the jacket they almost reached the end with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box, they called to the Vatican in the middle of the night and asked if they could talk to the Pope, as much as possible for Henry Kissinger.
They were gradually invited to speak to the U.S. diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the pope himself woke up to the phone, the two disturbed themselves and put their headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he scanned spare parts to build a kmitometer, he found Bill Hewlett's number on the phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had a secured summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at that time and formed my view of what this company is and how it should behave with its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees who visited the company’s research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was big like a bag, he had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager, I went up and up in HP, I broke around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How innovation is invented:
In a few places Jobs talks about how he invents new products for running.
At the beginning of his career, when he was released to sell a few tablets with flat connections, one customer asked him to build the entire computer together for him.
There were only 30 paid days available, during which he had to invent, assemble and add ready-made devices.
When he was later at Apple, he remembers the problems he faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember how we were quite wildly arguing... they shouted to me that it would take five years [to build a mice that would cost $300] until it stopped playing me, I went out and found a designer."
About ninety days later, we managed to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big the company breathes:
Long before Apple’s resurrection, Jobs predicted that many industry leaders in their vision were confused and lost their market share.
"We say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, well and what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At the moment, business and marketing are already governed, so companies are headed by people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are deprived of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that the company has led to its unnecessary position is now replaced by people who do not have an idea of good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge are necessary.
That’s what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times larger than it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s.
Instead of victory, they lost.
How innovation is the form of art:
"As a great idea and a great product, there is still a long way and a lot of work... and as the great idea is evolving and as it is changing and growing."
During that time you will learn a lot about it.
You have to access a range of compromises - certain things simply do not force electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things - different concepts - and assemble them together...
Finally, it depends on the taste - you are trying to think of the best things humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you are trying to move them into what you are doing yourself.
Picasso said good artists were copying, but the best artists were stealing.
I've never been ashamed of taking the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poetry, artists, zoologists, historians and the best computer experts in the world at the same time.
Without computers and new technologies, they could prove amazing things in entirely other industries.
Scalia and Thomas dinnered with opponents of the health care law at the time when their case was addressed by the court
On the day the Supreme Court was sitting behind the closed doors to discuss a political controversial question whether he would oppose President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a party dinner sponsored by the law firm, which will be held before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges took place to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases was the complaint raised by 26 states that questioned the radical reprocessing of healthcare that Congress adopted last year - a law that mobilised conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, but a 5.5-hour negotiation is expected in March, which will further further develop the presidential elections scheduled for 2012 and will be in full flow during the decision-making period.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and try to achieve the rejecting of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as US prosecutor-general for the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s legal company, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society’s annual dinner group, which has been dealing with the defence of conservative legal principles for years.
Another company sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations of the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of bet huge funds.
Dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
She participated, among other things, also Mitch McConnell, senior representative of the Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed supporter of the Health Care Act.
What about the invitation? Scalia and Thomas.
There is nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society’s actions for years.
And it’s definitely nothing about what would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of behavior subject to lower federal judges.
However, if not, their behaviour would certainly fall under the principle C4, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that are just related and other organizations organized in order to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, a honourable guest, or be listed in the action programme."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas with two law firms acting in the case, as well as companies with huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists seeking ethics in the government.
“This shocking breach of ethics and irrationality against the code of conduct is in contradiction with the claim of several judges that the Supreme Court is acting according to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and ate dinner for the benefit of the community together with the legal representatives who wait for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermine the feet with all claims of insolvency, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas just expressed their understanding against their critics and showed them that they also combine their judicial duties with actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a highly built conservative activist.
Conservatives also suggest that the ethical problem is mainly the judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as a prosecutor-general for President Obama’s government when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
The Kagan critics pushed her to refuse to participate in the case, claiming that at that time she fought for the law so much as to be now unpleasant.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing has earned a record order for airplanes worth $18 billion
Airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 two-wheel power planes with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner airlines to Aman Air, for which it incass more than $1 billion.
When a company receives an order for 50 pieces of its products, it is usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if Boeing Co. is the aircraft manufacturer and the price of these 50 airplanes makes a record of $18 billion, it is something different.
The same important report is where Boeing acquired an order: the Middle East, the growing golden bowl for future aircraft orders.
According to predictions issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history for commercial airplanes - 50 dual-flow Boeing 777.
The censorship order came from Emirates’ airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said the airlines could buy another 20 aircraft, which would increase the total value of the order to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes called Dreamliner, which are proud of a significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six flights exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the whole Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to those nations with oil.
This means that they not only have money to pay for aircraft, but the rise in the price of drives - mostly harmful airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive because the country itself earns oil at higher prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or delay aircraft orders due to an increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
“They have so natural protection,” he says.
The airline order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leading position on the broad-speed aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to narrow airlines, which attempted to distort Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives announced that the first flight of their largest aircraft A350, which is the direct competitor of the 777-300ER, will be cancelled.
The removal was due to the fact that customers were demanding more useful loads of the aircraft and flight, so the manufacturer took time to allow the machines to add more power to the engine.
The share price of Boeing Co rose by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
Mexican President's sister was defeated in the Michigan elections.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon, from the PRI, helped drug dealers in hunting after the governor’s chair.
Philip Calderon's sister seemed to have lost in the violent state elections on the post-government in Michoacán. On Monday she later announced that one of her opponents was able to help drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results were assessed by the leadership in the Western government elections to Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The role of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday's elections is alarming not only for Michoacán but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview after Sunday elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion survey group... they enjoyed the election urnes, built roadways... and allowed people to vote for the order for the PRI.
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until the year 2000, when it came to the presidency.
However, it plans a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win in the presidential elections in July.
It appears that Vallejo defeated Calderon, which led a day before the election, was just very close.
Calderon, a conservative candidate for her brother’s National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valleyon as a winner.
Thirdly, Silvano Aureolis, candidate to the left Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has been controlled by the Governor’s office, is a very unfortunate prosecution for the debated and sadly persecuted party in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, refuses any relationship with drug dealers and urges other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cardles specializing in marijuana, heroin and metamphetamines.
This is the birth state of President Calderon, and just in Michoacán, in December 2006, a military fight against merchants began.
The violence continued.
The oldest of PAN, Louisy Marie Calderon, was killed just a week before the elections and many candidates for the election resigned from fear.
However, whether the results of the elections in Michoacán look for the PRI party anyway, the victory of the party will help gain a new impulse.
The expected representative of the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington, congratulated Valley and said, "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls for Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be ready to rescue the Eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise a global decline in the world economy could also have a negative impact on the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s headquarters in Manila, said two of the world’s fastest-growing economies must “do everything they can to help quickly restore the currency block through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all European difficulties "unexpectedly" and said that Asian financial aid in conjunction with European leadership and funding will help reduce the long-term crash of the global economy.
"We're all together."
"So it is suitable for everyone who could help Europe from the crisis," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it is certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested for several months by a severe debt crisis.
In recent days, the lending costs of Italy have increased dangerously and the governments of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has caused concerns that the global economy could again fall into recession, and a call has begun to unite the newly-growing front economies and help the Eurozone find solutions.
Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of European Union financial aid funds, the European financial stability institution - would provide more negotiations to Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India's Foreign Minister, said that "Nobody will do what they can" to help the Eurozone because its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and drying foreign capital approach.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and incalculable," he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
"It's not an alternative, it's a dirty fact because otherwise we could find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others say that developing economies, such as India, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown’s University in the United States, said it would be politically difficult to explain aid to 1.2 billion inhabitants of India when 800 million of them live from $2 or less a day.
"One could find that the Greeks are retiring in the 50s and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult to explain to them," he said.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, also questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain well-paid employment to many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis threatened to be a "dangerous dominical effect".
The bank’s prediction that in Asia there will be 7.5% economic growth between 2011/2012, is now facing the risk of decline due to European threats.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets must create "unpredictable expenditure plans" to protect them from the decline and significant impact of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon on possible defence strikes
Defence Minister Leon Panetta has been firmly undercovered in Congress on Monday as he warned that rising automatic budget cuts can threaten national security and trigger a financial chain response starting in Pentagon and continuing to fight in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will now have to spend a budget reduction of $450 billion over the next 10 years, but it is now concerned that another $600 billion reduction is now being made unless Congress fails to conclude an expenditure agreement.
"The effects of these scratches would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said Congress’s inability to reach an agreement on the budget, resulting in the so-called settlement, resulting in a 23% downturn and shutdown of many new projects.
“Due to such a huge reduction in this unreasonable way, most of our construction or ship projects cannot be carried out – you can only buy three-quarters of buildings or ships, and additional modernization efforts could be seriously damaged,” Panetta wrote to Senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction has to take place so quickly, we will also have to almost surely send civilians to a forced vacation to be able to meet target requirements."
“These changes can be shattered by the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its preparedness.”
Finally, the cut will also touch the fighting units, Panetta said.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations in the sea will not directly affect this stop, there will be a negative impact on those operations by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"It will also occur in the contractual staff, which will result in delays of contracts that support our people's military efforts."
"The status of paid employees will be reduced, including delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
The two senators resigned Panetto ten days ago and asked him for details on possible impacts on automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of stops at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of views on the United States as a world military force."
"We are strictly opposed to this hard action," Senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not the conclusion we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"Planned cuts are a threat to U.S. national security, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Panett's letter and fresh warning will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to leave the list of checked areas.
Panetta has recently been increasingly open in conversations about possible cuts, although he himself has moved to his high position in Pentagon with long years of experience with the approbation of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to a hard fight.
At a minute-week press conference, the Defence Minister pointed out a brief picture of what his resort could expect - the army's crash, but within which the core will be missing.
"It will be like a ship without seafarers."
"It'll be like a brigade without a gun."
"It'll be like an airplane without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, such as an army of cassarians, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who could complete the mission," Panetta said in a Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, the attack will be welcomed..."
In the annex added with the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it describes how the reduction will result in "significant operating risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitation of possibilities of advantages and seats around the world; predicted unacceptable risks in future combat operations."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defence projects could expect endings, including those already tested, even those that are only in early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 project, planned new bomber, new generation ballistic navy, new coastal battleships and a new land fighter vehicle, which the army and seafarers wanted to replace humvees.
By stopping further development and testing the F35 aircraft would save $80 billion over the next 10 years, but its supporters argue that it is a further step in improving the army needed to address the country's potential threats by China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A light look at recent newspaper titles indicates how serious and universal lies and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands working with the allegation of having sexually disturbed several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
Officers at Penn State University were accused of blameless testimony when they tried to hide records that a retired football coach had sexually assaulted the boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was arrested as the launch microphone told U.S. President Barrack Obama that Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lie has been able to destroy the entire career and to destroy the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made himself a fool when he revealed the information that was immediately withdrawn by undeniable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of abusing the funds from his campaign to try to hide his unmarried relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circle that broke around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his role of sexual intercourse with Monico Lewinska.
It's all about fake stories at school and at university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test responses only to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud is acceptable.
How many frauds do we meet?
Studies show that in one day you'll have 10 to 200 cases somewhere.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study has shown that foreigners have spent three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting in life.
Determination of lies, or "recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should gain for personal or working reasons.
But it's not a social game that would be similar, let's say, Sharada, when a person shouts, "I have you." The recognition of falsehood is a serious sector of science working with scientific data collected over the last six decades in the field of prestigious universities in the course of psychological and detailed research projects.
One of the results of the research is that most old myths about lies have been refunded.
The liars look calmly into your eyes.
It's not like they're shaking, cooking, red or shaking.
Don’t let it be hard to notice and reveal lies.
The school lies identifier can reveal the truth from the May building, small expressions in the face, the way to create questions and timeline them.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the extensive and evolving sector of lies, and it is clear that the discovery of lies is a modern skill that can be easily taught and can help you very much in today’s complex world - especially if you take care of your responsibilities.
Good liars are able to read well in others, allow them to be careful, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
From research we know that extroverts lie more often than introverties, that men claim more "centric" lies, while women say more "focused" lies - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but worse, they lie).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone lies?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have later findings to compare with.
Note the holding of the body of the subject, its laughter, working with the voice.
You should know if someone regularly knocks his legs constantly so that you don’t accuse him of lies just because he starts knocking his legs in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to determine the clues of false verbal and nonverbal behaviour.
Take it only as a warning signal, not as a proof of lies.
People with lies can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their imaginary story, the tops of the boots can turn to the door, move to the east, significantly change the body's holding, or give them a "relief after the conversation" - overwhelming breathing, overwhelming breathing.
People performing interviews often issue a fake signal that an interview is at the end, just to see how it will look relieved after its ending.
Also see the subject's language.
The story is famous about how Scott Peterson once discouraged and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which led to a national search for her body.
Deceitful individuals can also express themselves moderately: "I had no sexual relationship with Mrs. Lewinsky" or they repeat the difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal characters are just very uncomfortable.
Someone can use a lot of "relenting language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best consciousness."
In such a response, we don’t know too much facts and it’s often another warning signal.
There is no magic that can reveal every lie, but it is possible to gain the skills with which lies can be deceived.
With these skills, a person will have a greater chance to find a liar and a fraud in his own personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of petroleum pipes will be redirected after the threat of delay by the US government
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to delay the approval of the planned oil pipe from Canada to the Mexican Gulf - which respected trade unions against itself, but cleared environmentalists - the company holding a pipeline building has announced that she is willing to redirect the project to the things again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that the planned route was moved from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will also be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
The stage of TransCanada Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the pipeline construction will eventually be approved, although it will lead another path.
This announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it dismissed a federal project authorisation decision from where it will not conduct studies of possible replacement routes, with which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills area in Nebraska and in the waterproof layer of Ogallal, the extensive underground water tank.
"This is really a move forward," Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska told Fox News.
A new ecological assessment ordered by the Foreign Ministry would likely withdraw any decision until 2013, i.e. a year after the next year’s elections, but authorities refuse to play some role in politics in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the Foreign Ministry and expressed his support.
1,700 miles long tubes will connect Canada and the Mexican Gulf.
From the province of Alberta to the refinery in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil are protected daily.
This way, six countries will be forced to move.
This project is absolutely hateful of environmentalists, but it is loved by workmen who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on pipelines.
However, lawmakers in Nebrascia have set up and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company to not intervene in the Sand Hills region and the water layer of Ogallal, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The current environmental impact study ordered by the Foreign Ministry found that the project would only have a small negative environmental impact, but the energy industry source said that the Ministry's inspector general ordered a new review of the process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
It was once that the lobbist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, did not represent the conflict of interest in the program.
Then, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not properly selected as it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being scared of her death.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle rushed into the vestibule of their Manhattan house and frightened their daughter by turning away from that fear.
"Lady Marmalade" hit eighteen-month Genevieve Monk scared so much that she suffered "performance changes, sleep disturbances" and "hearted fear of strangers," her family said in a complaint filed to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
On November 10, last year, Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a school teacher, and Genevieve went on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk added the car, Roseanna Monk went down to their house vestibule in Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a moment and the child was delayed for a moment.
Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to raise her."
LaBelle punished a pregnant woman irritably.
“Agressive tone she said to me, ‘You shouldn’t put your daughter to the door,” Roseanna Monková said.
"I said to her, 'I don't care about your opinion.'"
She screamed and began to speak straight - she shouted loudly the simplest words...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she began to drink water after me.
He claims Genevieve got a hysterical invasion.
"I said to the woman, 'Look at what you have done to my daughter'," the mother told the child.
LaBelle threw her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her accompaniment, which then threw her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monková.
In the meantime, the girl shouted so much when she turned back, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter to LaBelle to apologize, but they did not answer.
Lawyers and speakers of LaBelle don't respond to our phone calls to express the whole case.
The complainant demands closer unprecedented compensation, but family attorney Sam Davis said that the case was free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the fine money on a charity organization with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
“This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding a 18-month child in hand.”
Climate-freeness has accelerated the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdeze, unemployment and unemployment in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and with them also the economy.
The year 2011 is recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria Lópeze Valdeze, which is called the government of change itself. This government has brought with itself great expectations in terms of economic progress, however due to the unfavourable climate conditions of the economy at the beginning of the year.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, restricted the possibilities of the state economy’s growth, and are aware of a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year, a historic decline in agriculture by 31.16%, which distorts the dynamics of other sectors.
According to the report of damages issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damages were reported to 582,835 hectares of processed soil, 78,03% of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% partially damaged.
The decline in economic activity up to November resulted in a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased by 74 percent over the first three quarters. From January to March, the average of unemployment increased by 8%, and from January to March, the average of unemployment increased by 4%, and from January to March 5, the average of 55 053 population of Sinaloa.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard Lópeze Cervantese, the Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at public policy level.
"We are witnesses of growing unemployment related to various factors. They include loss of liquidity on the market due to resource limitation due to legislation approved by the Congress in the fight against the dirty washing of money. For people who illegally manage them to invest them, it's not easy to get out of
Stop migration
López Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, just as for reasons of easy entry, and then also because even if these people get out of the border, it is difficult for them to find work. Therefore, people remain and demand work from our state, and thus unemployment increases," he said.
Insecurity
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to increasing incompetence in the field of employment, and 60.38% of the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy of the State are working without deducting benefits from social security administration.
There are additional features of the labour market, such as low wages. In this administrative territory, the lowest wages from all over the country, according to the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labour and Social Planning Secretariat registers.
The average monthly income of employees in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pese by September, deeply below the national average, which is 7 375 pese.
Reduction of foreign direct investments
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investments in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, the direct foreign investment reached $630 697 before the period, which represents a decline of $31.3 in the same year by 87.74% against the share of the same year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State government has set investments of 17,280 million pedestrians per year. These investments were mainly aimed at services companies.
Dluh
In the context of the scenario of decline in the economy, the government of this state requested a State Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. It would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban regions in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2600 million pesos. No loans were approved from the state to November.
Reactions
According to representatives of the entrepreneurial sector, the first year of the government, Maria Lópeze Valdése, pointed out a lack of government management capabilities.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of harmonisation of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really uncomfortable during this year. We have to work intensely to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double our efforts, the lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, especially, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government will be better," said Dofe.
The slowness of the economy
Loredo López stated that events such as colds at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its development and growth.
"The poor economic movement was caused by a number of events, among other things frozen. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not remember quickly enough to increase again the dynamics that would allow us to reach an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services."
Redefinition of the mission
According to Teodor Salazara Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state must be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"We generally notice that it is working. We believe it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan that will re-define the goals and economic orientation of the state, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa has," he said.
The work that is in front of us
President Coparmex emphasized the importance of establishing a vision of the future that would be better governed by the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, some progress has been made in the field of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in the governance of public policy.
"There are elements that allow the government to claim that it is trying to be friendly. I can say that it is here to see the work done and I believe that the government is aware of the fact that there is also a lot of work before us," he said.
Condemned for 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of punishment for holding eight pounds of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was sentenced for a crime threatening health, in particular for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by components of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 on a hike in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer went in a pickup type of white. In the car in the pocket he had a black bag and a small pocket on the seat of a comrade. Soldiers found 8 kilograms 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, a secured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Division and proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Criminal Crimes.
Debts contributions to projects
Social projects that are part of programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Places and 3x1 for migrants are at risk that they will not be questioned at the end or that they will be delayed due to missing economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The City Social Development Director said that if construction work has gone ahead, it is now threatening that the government will not be able to provide appropriate supplies that require more than 11 million peso funds for three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is nearly 50 million peso. The state is 25%. By this time only the funds for work have been supplied by the Federation and the city, so it is possible that the implementation of the projects will be delayed.
"They have to secure nearly 12 million, and although the year is over, we did not get anything at all. And even though we had to get part already in July," he said. "To waste time, we started projects and continue very apparently, but we lack money."
He said last year, after the administration of Jesus’s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not complete the corresponding shipping, so at the beginning of the new period the city had to ask for a loan to pay more than 7 million dollars that the government had not given them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period because the state had no economic capacity to participate and the programs went further. To reach the programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state had not completed," he explained.
Despite the fact that government officials had a vow on the transfer of these resources, he said that the request was sent to Armandu Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to strengthen the proceedings and to reach the corresponding percentage as soon as possible.
“They had to give us 12 million dollars, and although the year is near the end, we haven’t even received peso yet.”
The Court approves "the end of analogue broadcasting" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the Constitutional Appeal submitted by the Senate and Parliament against the Presidential Decree to accelerate the so-called "excluding analogue signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
The majority of four ministers, including the court president, Juana Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree that set out individual steps that would lead to a transition to earthly digital television.
This result was rejected by the Senate's appeal, because the qualified majority of the eight votes necessary to express the constitutionality or inconsistency of the said decree remaining in force.
Proposal for a decision by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the Decree inconvenient because the regulation of all radio and television issues is a matter reserved by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Parliament supported a constitutional dispute in the attempt to combat the Decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero adopted requirements and suspended the application of the Decree and all the actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of Ministers also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Parliament without entering into the debate on the proposal, which is also concerned by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he was not identical with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare the public administration through general standards.
"I don't think it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as telecommunications sector belongs to a federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It relates to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is believed that removing the change would mean removing the benefits of digitalisation that requires decisions in public interest, for digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but also affects economic, social, political and national security issues.
As he stressed, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic orientation of the state, including a range of competences that the Constitution entrusted to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and thus made it through their governments, although they had highly specialized technical authorities available.
He said that it was not possible for the government to enter into the administrative field of adherence to the laws prepared by the legislative powers by publishing a non-consensual decree which, to a certain extent, interferes in the area of the Congress’ powers.
In Michoacán analyses the possibility of counting "voice after voice"
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second position in the Governor's elections is less than 27 percent. 879 votes of 6074 votes have not yet been calculated.
The "vote after vote" option appeared in the elections in Michoacán this year, where, according to the data published by the Preliminary Results Programme (PREP), the difference is between the first and second place in the Governor's elections of less than 27 percent, and the votes of 879 of the total voters of 6074 have not yet been included.
In this context, María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, Chairman of the General Assembly of the Institute of Elections in Michoacán (IEM), recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority adopted a number of measures to harmonise local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As already mentioned, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution, or his State electoral code, or the Law on Election Justice, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force had to expire during this period of entry into force, and the governor of the Ophthalm of the Ophthalm of the Ophthalm.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative powers and declared the voice of the Head of State in constitutional reforms as "unvalid and illegal" because it does not have the right to "approve or vote".
On the question of the possibility of "vote after vote" María de los Ángeles Llanderal responded that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the IEM General Council it will be possible to carry out partial and overall calculation by the local electoral authority.
In this way, partial number of votes, one or more voting packages will be possible under the following conditions: the results of the election will not agree; there is no record of the number of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or the given chairman will not be available; or if there have been errors and obvious infringements.
In addition, the overall recalculation of the votes in all elections will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the elections and the candidate in the second place is less or equal to one percentage point; whenever an explicit request of the representative of the Party and/or the other coalition appears at the beginning of the session.
The overall recalculation of the votes will also be possible when the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request of the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place, whereby the candidate will be elected.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to PREP, the difference is between the first and second position of less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 elections have not yet been counted.
His last will
His pocket will be scattered in the Mount of Fire, the family confirmed.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his native city. During Monday, a festival and breathtaking mosque will be held.
According to the family, the undercoach was the last wish for his potter to be scattered in the hill Zagninamé.
After receiving the highest honour with other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortése family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the aircraft of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends attended a ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon of the sub-council, the pope arrived in a chapel located in the class Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 a.m., a separation was held at the Saltillo Technical Institute, which was organized by his former technological high school colleagues and members of the American football team, whose Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of maturity preparation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his poultry be scattered in the Mount of Fire. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a pilot's sister.
According to her, the subjugator fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and entered the Colegio del Aire air school in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, but he always followed his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio reminds him as a very good man, “the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Marthu Sahagún to Saltillo.”
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he had the best in his life: aircraft management.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, we were separated with all the honors that came to him to give up by Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government, the Mexican Army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the Mexican Air Force Center, the head of the year at the University of Sallo, and the Technical.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the helicopter that was driving fell, and on board was also a secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of the state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillen's family Bacio Cortése (beaten) arrived to be transferred through the funeral service by the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the space where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, relatives and other relatives, and students.
Three dead bodies were found on the ship of Caderey NL
A few hours before the investigation, military officials presented 11 people detained in this area for crimes associated with organized crimes.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned property of the municipality of Caderey Jiménez, Nuevo León.
It was found 1.5 km away from Caderey to Santiag, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the chatta with a beige-cafe plot had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, at a distance of about three meters, they noticed the body of three people, so the competent authorities immediately informed.
One person had a sport shirt in yellow color and dark cotton pants and no shoes, and he was also in a sport shirt with white strips.
A few meters further, the body of other people wearing a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants appeared.
All three laid their faces towards the ground.
According to the data collected on site, all three persons were probably killed elsewhere because there were no crashes found.
On the plot, messages addressed by one group of organized crimes were found, as well as a number of foots after the balls, both for standing and on the doors.
11 suspects were detained in Caderey
The National Defense Secrets presented 11 people, including youths, who were members of a criminal group, which operated in particular in the Caderey area and which are associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal funeral.
According to the information published in the first trial of 11 November in Los Alveros colony, eight people were detained and one detained was released.
Three property and mobile phones were secured, and they confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
On November 12, at 6:00 p.m., the military personnel were on a walk in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta, when they noticed a car without SPZ and two people there.
After the car stopped, they checked out and found one gun, a container and 18 chargers.
On the basis of these statements, on November 13, one of the La Frauda complexes was arrested at about 14 p.m. and he tried to escape when he saw the soldiers.
They were accused of illegal funeral in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Caderey.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed President of the Government, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him a new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the past economic disaster.
The appointed President of the Government, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the Italian President to present him a new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the passing of the economic disaster and has put the whole eurozone in danger.
The president's palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm him that he can establish a government.
It is expected that it will be represented by a majority of technocrates, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of his conversations with political parties in an attempt to establish a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to create a government, but the ton of his comments indicated that obstacles are overcome.
"The story is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of establishing a government in less than three days, much shorter than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which led to the debt to an unsupervisable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a solid package of savings that European leaders require, which will only be able to restore Italy's confidentiality.
Due to the instability of the markets, interests from BTP’s Italian debt bonds exceeded a ten-year-old 7 percent limit, a level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, the president of the Italian employer organization of Confindustri, told reporters after a meeting with Monty: "We said we would very support this government."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity to get Italy out of this palm situation.
Monti’s hope for success was significantly multiplied thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predetermined for good results,” Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the middle-right party told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now, a number of its members have been built against the government with a technocratic majority set up by Monti.
Parliament support
The new Monti government must have strong support for Parliament to promote unpopular saving reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in a given effort could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti started discussions with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial groups, youth and women.
The bike will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed as President of Napolitan on Sunday, allowing a very quick process in response to the crisis.
After a short decline from the end of last week, when Berlusconi was already apparent to give a resignation, the interest rates of Italian debts have returned to the critical border and respond to the uncertainty of whether the new president of the government will dismiss success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is 1.8 billion euros, would be beyond the possibility of current reserves in the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should stand in power until the next elections planned for 2013, despite general forecasts that claim that politicians only give him time to make reforms and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but large parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts in order to bring Italy out of the hatred that the countries have entered due to financial pressure.
Political sources have stated that both sides of confidence and disagreement between the parties complicate attempts to integrate into government and political personality.
Spaniards participate more frequently in international matches than the Kostaričans
Of 22 Spanish footballers, ten cross the border of 50 international matches.
On the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 selected players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players of both countries who met at a friendly race today at 15:05 at the San José National Stadium.
While the world champions and Europe, number one of the FIFA Monthly Rating, have a wide range of A-Class inter-selecting matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who played as the only 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández stadium.
Spanish footballers who play in the Stars Championship and in the strong clubs of the English First League have maintained intense activity for a year at the League Championships and Home Championships and high-level competitions within the European Championships as Champions League.
To the previous one, we also have to add experience from the Spanish national team in complicated matches for the European and World Championships.
On the contrary, basketball players have very limited options for foreign matches in the area. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign competitions from the Spanish representation has on its account the bracketer Íker Casillas, who arrived at the former bracketer Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international competitions last Saturday before England (launch 0-1 in London).
Casillas will also arrive in Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international competitions.
Xavi Hernández, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his own.
Casillas and Xavi even last week officially announced UEFA with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their account. Among them, Zubizarreta is 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, is 102.
Carles Puyol also joined the club with 97 matches.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa with Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Costa Rica and close to Michael Umana, the left wing Júnior Díaz moves with 48 matches and the braid Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, Victor Bolívar has only one in Costa Rica, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the coast, Bryan Ruiz has the most interventions, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour with the opportunity to celebrate twenty years of existence
"The journey to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality."
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts on the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself ensures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a fulfilled dream for them.
This is what the bassist and founder Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour of celebrating 20 years of existence and will be on Sunday 20 on a unique stop in Central America.
This day will be released at the National Stadium from 19:30 along with the Angel group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an illustration from an interview whose entire resumption you can find on the La Nación website on the internet.
For your Costa Rica fan, this is a dream fulfilled. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans experience?
The journey to Costa Rica is our dream that becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we have barely been the second time and so far experiences have been great.
I was in Costa Rica only once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very pleased to bring our music to you.
I wonder, because this group literally loves, fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most popular fans?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
We took nearly 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry for it took us so long.
Some people are talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this cause greater pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we have performed in the last 21 years have occurred in the horizon of a few weeks.
We presented a few great shows in Sao Paul and we hope that this will make us a form for a concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to serve, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. These waves are incredible.
My friends travel to Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica, through people who love to surf.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Because we have never played here, we have no limitations that we couldn't do.
We'll try to play the best show with a variety of songs. We'll try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat a repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose what songs we’ll play every night.
When we have two three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them, and we’re also surprised, because we remember why we liked it so much and that we might have forgotten it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that’s why I think it’s more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art track.
When you look back, is it hard to believe in everything you have been able to do?
Yeah, sure.
First of all, I think no one of us can imagine being in one big rock group and staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much it was given to us and we realize that we can continue to play together.
We love and love making music.
We are lucky that we can look at the places we’ve always wanted.
We couldn't get better.
What does it mean for you that you were a significant part of the formation of the grunge genre?
We have always been honored to be part of this group in which the giants themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It’s surprising that when the movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen too often.
A group is created in the city from time to time, but it is much less usual that five to ten groups rise from one city.
We are proud of it and we are proud to be part of the Seattl Group.
Sometimes we're still playing with some.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are proud that we can be part of this movement that was created in Seattl.
It is also very unusual that a group like yours continues to have the same members, even after those years.
Yes, we four have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than the usual duration of the group.
First, I think we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and second, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other plays our role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this we have managed to open music paths that give everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate the music of others, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word of glory was not simple. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was increasingly easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too much for the tour, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of dames and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you have to respect music and respect what you have given it. You should not let you be ashamed of being famous, rock stars. This has never really been interested in any of us.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at the beginning it was something great.
As a chapel, we have existed for three years, and we have never released any albums until after Andy died (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we have been friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the chapel with us. When I hear some song or look at another pictures, I remember how frightened to work with Andy, how he was unbelievers.
She was an incredible person and we miss a lot.
The National Cape Las Robertas will be entrusted to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their job, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as a predecessor?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several suggestions, and this group loved us most, so we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very fun.
Why are you always changing the words Yellow Ledbetter?
That's the question of Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings to her and I think he adds the first one to attack him.
Who affects you as a basement?
A lot of people.
I'm first attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I can talk about the bases I like all night.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge, although it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've always felt easy to get away from the word grunge.
When grunge is said, I'll imagine groups I've mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who have created at the same time. And if this music is true today, then it's something great, because it's a music that's worth listening, and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At the beginning, your music was slightly cloudy and now it is more positive.
What is the value of this change?
This is interesting because I feel that in the new album there are a couple of songs that are easier to play, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very dark, although they may sound positive.
When Ed played with me, I cried, and they're deeply dark.
I think when you grow up and have a trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or friend, these things will begin to influence your art and music, and these two songs are just that for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make a dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re-hospitaled for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested due to the muscle loss he suffers in the area of the lower ends.
72-year-old Fujimori, who refuses to punish 25 years of liberty for violations of human rights committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operational four times and are currently under control of doctors.
Ms. Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told TV station Canal N that Fujimori will be testing at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why it hurts and why it loses strength in the lower ends.
Aguinaga said Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, however, the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times due to tongue cancer, jumped 18 kilograms, and other troubles were added to these problems, such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst on the mucus, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been sentenced since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the death of 25 people who killed the murdering escadron of an army acting illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to reach the expansion of trade between the two nations and touch the political topics of the region.
Mujica will meet its Mexican opponent Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a comprehensive meeting with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political affairs between the two countries," the Uruguayan President's office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to force Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy ranked South American into a list of tax paradise at the G20 meeting in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries, which will continue to remain in the position of tax paradise, will be excluded from the international community, and that statement issued a refusal opinion by Uruguay and consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November. The G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January of this year, Latin America has concluded an exchange of information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has strived to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get out of the "black charter" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to which countries have not implemented all required international tax cooperation standards.
From a commercial perspective, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the Free Trade Agreement since 2004, thanks to strengthening the trade between the two countries.
Youth installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting for more than 25 years untired to save Princess Peach from Bowser’s confusions, but has never appeared in 3D: in Super Mario 3D Land, she will fight for the love of the girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month to all shops around the world has been created since the beginning to take advantage of all the features of the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that must tell how stereoscopes are to work without glasses," Omar Álvarez, a journalist who specializes in Nintendo in Spain, said during a videogame presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because so far successful images like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" have been an adaptation of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the 3D photo, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and lasting game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", its task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you cross this level, you can go into the "second wheel" on the levels of games that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome the various challenges and "independent from optical lies".
This new 3D Super Maria feature also predicts the return of the characters to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays in the note for those who watch and repeat the successful formula from the previous pieces. It is that the installer of a thick man will have to go through dangerous late platforms to release Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in movements, in the surroundings, in clothing, and also among enemies, Luigi also appears "playing".
Colom approves Portilla issue to the United States
President Alvaro Colom on Tuesday announced that he had taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who is expected to respond to a fight to wash $70 million in the United States.
This ends the process aimed at responding to the request of the northern country, which requires the issue of Portilla to be able to judge it.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judicial and executive power and that he remembered that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his mandate he had "not intervened" in court judgments and allowed all the editions he received on his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be issued for murder and serious health injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s step means a step in execution after all judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead a trial against the former president who ruled between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of 120 million defeat at the Ministry of Defense during his presidency. This process was preceded by the edition, but the Ministry of Public Affairs revoked the case and returned to the game.
Trinity helped 6000 young people in a state of threat
The organization was created to help children without education to not feel at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the organization of social support Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people who are threatened to social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this end, there is a need to include hundreds of long jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Last anniversary was also aimed at introducing a balance in the framework of a celebration act that took place in the former production premises of the Fabra and Coats factory, with more than 300 participants.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 in order to help young people with low-education, unemployed, faced drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
A large number of representatives of organizations and institutions who have cooperated with associations in the past 25 years have participated in the last meeting in Sant Andreu.
A variety of political representations, at the time of the elections, showed the uniform character of the work done by Trinity.
Together with the President of Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Advisor for Education, Ernest Maragall, and former Deputy Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Council Ricard Goma, participated in the celebration act.
Fabra and Coats also arrived at the large Hall of Fabra and Coats, the current advisor for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General for Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created in a very difficult time and that today’s era also covers a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is “a good foundation.”
The President said Trinijove was an example of how to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new,” he said.
The house was removed, where gigantic parties were held.
Veterans owned 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday afternoon without putting resistance
All of this indicates that the nightmare experienced by neighbors from 51 in Balmes Street is finally at the end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building that they illegally lived and organized giant partys that were built by neighbours, leaving the building without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, the door lock was replaced to avoid repeating the situation.
“The entrance will be kept safe from this moment,” the manager said.
The occupants who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are residential - took away all electrical and partially and water equipment, in addition to paint the walls and left all kinds of waste, particularly the bags after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge festivals, which lasted up to two days, and the other rentals broke out.
In addition to the building, there is a disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, the markets fell by 80%.
The owner of the discoteque stressed that the occupants of the building made her a bad competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discoteque costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of neighbours due to the noise. However, the problems were not caused by visitors to discotheses, but the residents of the abandoned house, and especially those who participated here in parties, whose frequency and intensity increased in the last weeks, according to the distorted population of the surrounding area.
The owner of the disks explained that the problems were so big that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiven for nine months.
City police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
President of the PP People's Party, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week that "the building should be immediately moved and ended with the problems of civilian cohesion suffered by neighbours and the destruction of the area."
The President of the People explained that only one floor was prevented before the summer, but in the last few months the occupants entered all the fathers of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them even stolen.
In this regard, he added that “it must be ended with the impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that occurred in the building.”
The city police also cleaned the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes, the police arrived in the 35th building on the Mont-Ral Street after it was called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
Architects meet at the time of writing the procedure, which bears more than a question about fees
The 16-gates city selection will again open a debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, during the time of the biggest bloom, Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamflets to support Collserola Park.
The airplane defines the mountain as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
More than that, it was supplemented by numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few not oriented to the axis north - south, but up (hour) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collseroly as a natural park is in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild animals instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until September when the mayor announced a mega competition for 16 competitions on the same number of entry gateways to Collseroly.
The gate, of course, records rather the idea of the park.
Whether this or someone is trying to put the gate on the field.
The only question is, is Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organizational and based on a reflection on the city, this issue becomes a central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s already the same theme as when two members of this old caste elected at the meeting in the elevator put their hands.
And that’s what he has created one of the rare consensus between what three Barcelonan architects and the most prominent university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the question of the Gulf party began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "high side", so the Ildefonse Cerda's speech on green apples was not questioned until the end.
“We must be based on the principle that the farest Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex, said the architect, for whom the name "Gate to Collserola" has in itself a "lexicological paste": we should not imagine them as "as entry into the park, but rather as a definition of the zone where it is possible to act".
Modol, as well as Roldán and Bayona, with experiences from the world of urbanism, qualify the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that is "a certain danger".
The danger arising from "the uncertainty that presents today's public space project" after the 80's experience, which had in the Forum's "her singing work".
The first concern is to define the boundaries where it should be built.
"Defining something means to take another step already," that is, basically, moving a step further.
"We need to remember new urbanistic and planning tools because those current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real funeral."
If we focus more in detail on the question, Modol believes that the valley of Sv. Collserola can be "recognized as a park", but the part of Barcelona is not, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserola, which "is not able to end on the ground", although she welcomes the fact that the councillor offers its greeting that it has been invading the project from the "first moment".
In addition, it means that the proximity to the mountains and the city is somewhat a shame that allows architects to participate in the debate, but "discuss" that this should be exactly the technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", adds), which needs to be created: "Architects should only be tools".
Bayona pointed out that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complicated because in the framework of the selection procedure, Collserola's global vision is missing: "16 selection procedures have been declared to deal with all the axes of the mountain - the sea, but there is no long-term study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes at least he to sign up in all 16 selections.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate can affect the concept and definition of the architect of a neighbouring gate.
According to him, the municipality should ensure that the zone located directly above Ronda de Dalt should ensure the entire length of the area of equipment to ensure a continuous transition between the city and the greens.
Casino runs Jonas Larrazábal to be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal officer Cadino Red gave grace to Mayor's brother Monterrey in a process in which he was accused of alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison and is now released after the legal officer of Casino Red gave him mercy in front of the Second Criminal Court in the district, which discussed the case of extortion, in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was charged.
After the assault on Casino Royale, the owner of Casina Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas had to request payment of economic quotas after him to allow the Monterrey mayor's illegal operation in the bet house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecution initiated a criminal prosecution of the brother of the panic mayor. On September 2 he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent before Agent No. 3 of the State Department for property crime, he was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
He stayed here for the next 49 days after the second imprisonment regulation was issued, and Agent of the Public Ministry rejected the possibility of co-participation or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Caderey Criminal Court for suspicion of extermination of the owners of Casina Red for one and a half million pesos, but only a few hours in prison with moderately severe supervision because he was threatened with death.
The leaders allowed him to stay in San Nicolás de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was given a detention order issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that almost two months after the investigation had been collected enough evidence to prove Jonah’s guilt.
This Monday, the legal officer Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, sent to Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for grace for the brother of the Mayor of the region.
During the legal negotiation with the representative of the General Ministry allocated to the court, Ramiro Arias asked García Gómese whether damage had been repaired and who of the colleagues decided to give mercy, but the lawyer clearly stated that the name will remain hidden.
On the basis of the official record 197/2011, the legal gratitude of Jonas Larrazábal is granted. In the proceedings against him, no complaint can be filed. It is also impossible to apply for compensation for damages or penalties.
After translating with the legal authority about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, went to a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonah that he had been granted the official grace and his case was delayed into the archive.
He also informed him that the judge issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretariat Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the air accident in which Governor's secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation in which the government’s secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed indicated that the helicopter had been affected directly with full force without the pilot had a chance to try forcibly landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot noted that climate conditions allow flights.
"Parts that appear, suggest that the unit has come into contact several times with the land, wings have entered the branches of the trees 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons, and therefore fulfilled all the requirements for the transportation of the staff.
In addition, he noted that no components were found on the ground based on the investigation in the area of the impact.
"When searching, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the fortress as a celiest.
"The headquarters were designed for 19 people, fulfilling all passenger transport requirements.
The terrain has a tendency of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary has assured that at the moment it is the most important to obtain results as soon as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Assistants, said the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at the speed of the trip and an accident occurred on a soft rising ground at the moment of the attack.
“This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a regular overflow operation,” he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome appointed six key investigation points:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the air standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Weather conditions:
Notifications in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at departure, in accordance with this aircraft proceeding towards the border, the visible layers between the DF and the State of Mexico were cloudy at low heights.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudy crew, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavaca valley.
The location of the strike.
The collision coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar are consistent, it is likely that before the collision there has been no loss of control or disruption of the flight pathway.
Exploitation of aircraft residues in a limited territory:
The information we are currently available allows us to assume that the attack has occurred on a straight pathway and on the other hand.
The drawing of the residue of the aircraft indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the strike.
There was no fire or explosion recorded.
There was no evidence recorded at the location of the accident that would show that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that several contacts with the firm could have occurred.
During the field work, residues of aircraft were found at a height of up to 9,200 feet above the sea, the area is stirred, the height of the tendency ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
Photographs show pictures that are likely to break along the said route.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could get into contact with lands in several places.
After a careful search in the area of the accident, in a territory that is wider than the territory of the excavation, there were no remains of a helicopter found, which strengthens the belief that the attack occurred in a state where the helicopter was still complete.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance launched a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover genes responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. Research is conducted with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it conducts research with the aim of discovering genes that cause obesity in children and adolescents. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will enable you to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Biochemistry Research Unit from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st century National Medical Center, explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workforces was established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
People can attend the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where youth tests will be conducted every 8 hours on Sunday.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexican State) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (Mexican State).
As soon as data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and significance of genetics as regards the development of obesity, and to present risk factors to Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day celebrated on 14 November, he reminded that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 years, with the consent and under parental supervision, for the application of specific nutritional questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that every Saturday with all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, circuit), blood pressure is measured, the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined and the genes are examined (to identify the genes involved in the occurrence).
Cruz López said that this research reflects healthcare professionals’ concern about the alarming increase in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that only in six years, only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%.
He stated that one of the reasons for searching for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from the other populations in their genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact reflects in genes responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that overall obesity genetics are generally explained as an inability to burn excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the condition of children, so that they will find out if they show some known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark colors (acantosis) on the throat and predecessor indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetic conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors transmit it in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and changes in lifestyle they have to make to avoid the disease of their children.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: seating lifestyle that means a lack of day-to-day physical activity, a day-to-day sitting in front of television and the use of transportation instead of walking short distances.
Overweight is also caused by a high caloric intake, that is, greater consumption of salted beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic loads that are subject to this research.
Asphalt from UNAM will not be required
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate and temperature.
If it was properly taken care of the beach, there would be no need to repair nearly 200 thousand rainfalls after each rainfall period in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist from the UNAM Chemistry Faculty (FQ), who at the same time added that if it were possible to remove the construction and maintenance of the beach, it would be possible to remove the beach or the maintenance of the beach.
In his lecture, the Technological Cause of Smoking, which was carried out within the International Year of Chemistry, announced that the laboratory under its leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, as well as in low-costs.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the production of waste.
He explained that asphalt, the hardest part of oil, is the collection of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a high molecular weight called asphalts, and other with a low molecular weight called maltenes, together providing asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a firm state, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to smooth.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, a chemical engineering expert noted.
A researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible tile, consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt insert, made up of small stones wrapped in the asphalt and then compressed.
He emphasized that every stone that forms an insert is to be wrapped with asphalt.
When driving cars or creating pressure, it is possible that the strengths in the floor are well distributed.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would be even better distributed, a chemical engineer thinks.
He added that on the asphalt insert the last layer called a cloth, consisting of a fine stone, that is, also a sand covered in the asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the vehicle racks, it must have a greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the drilling of the car.
Since large loads will be exposed as part of the beach, the garment must have adequate thickness and must be paid attention to the material from which it is manufactured.
Climate, particularly moisture and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be remembered. In particular, water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt inserts.
As soon as the area is wet, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, it causes softening of all layers of the tile and thus the formation of swellings.
He explained that during the creation of bulbs, the film is first to destroy the garment and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, it does not occur in one moment, but it is a slow process that should stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the production of dishes, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of the dishes must correspond to the loads of the vehicles and must ensure that this load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera noted that as regards asphalt, we are still waiting for a lot of work and research is at the beginning, for example, asphalt emulsions that are already available on the market in other countries, allowing us to easily fix the requirements without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing the Valle candidate to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna not getting Miss Colombia’s crown.
Valle gets the 14th title of the first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca hasn't reached Miss Colombia's crown again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the fact that she felt on the side of the winner, gained a silver crown and shepherd, based on which she became the new first multimiss Colombia.
On the basis of the results of the previous final in Cartagena, Als, where she won Miss Atlántico (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagena (19), Cartagenatina (19), Cartagenatina (19)
The question that many people ask. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a big favorite that in all previous wheels showed that she wanted to become a new Miss Colombia, and not free to become the Queen Police and the Beautifulest face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, which later took the title Miss Kolumbie.
One of the key factors that decided to appoint the board is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "What book loved you most and why?", placed by Martín Murillo Gómez from Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
"I read a lot. I really believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that most influenced me in my childhood was a "Little Prince", a very deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Crime". It's a book that all of us should know. Today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. It's a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
However, this response was not liked due to the term "culturalized" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned.
After the ceremony ended, Melina said she was calm and rejoiced with the result: “The world is wise what should happen, it will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a beautiful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle has destroyed his favorite positions.
The Bogot journalist pointed out that the candidate has been the most popular, most celebrated from the beginning, and that she has received all the previous awards (the Gastronomy Challenge of Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen's Mom), raised the jealousy of other candidates, and the queen, afterwards, stretched to the scene.
It was visible at the first presentation of the swimming pools on the Hilton Beach and within two overviews before the final crowning.
Although she was on both sides, it was known that she was missing the power and the flames presented by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter at Canal RCN, believes that Melinda won the title of the first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who earns the most titles during the competition eventually does not leave with the Queen's crown.
In the last few days, Valle has stopped an inconsistent attitude toward the media and it hasn’t been paid.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has failed to convince the court of his interest in social work, which are the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the edge, two days before the election of the international court member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of their country.
"In the competition Miss Colombia beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle’s candidate lost points due to the deficiencies of her background and fibrosis that was visible on the backbone. However, it is completely contrary to the dictatorship of the court, which she chose miss “natural beauty” for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina had no best body to have better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on the back, which, in my opinion, was not too familiar, were dressed by her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, reporter Guido Hoyos, from Cromos, believes that a relative from Valle made a mistake when undergoing several surgical interventions.
Surgical interventions are okay, but in Valle they did not.
The body was never her strong side, and here she chose her tax.”
Due to this award granted by the National Beauty Assembly for the first time, a cruel prediction came upon after the overlooking of the floods, which was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina had desired not to ultimately grant her the highest crown.
Whether it’s true or not, Melina has started her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the Queens who, despite the success of Cartagena, failed to reach the highest crown.
This was the work of the Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonse Cana.
A fingerprint expert from Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc’s top leader: “Alfonse Cana” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint specialists working at the CTI department, this week was a series at Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada, who has been working in court research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked at the municipality of Chocó, where he often had to go through a wave for more than five days to get to the place where the dead were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle, and after graduating from the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints.
In the week when the operation was carried out against the said Alfonsi Can, Eliazar told him to take clothes with him for at least three days.
I was expecting something big.
On Friday night he arrived in Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two dead bodies and suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked him to take his fingerprint card from Guillermo León Sáenze (his true name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team to the place where the body was, he didn't recognize him because of physical irritation, he looked completely different than in the media.
He had no wings, dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much thinner.
But the prints aren't available.
Together with the galton wolf, ink and transplanter and the light of Eliazar began to compare the doctyl records of the dead with the records from the card.
It wasn't a shame: it was Alfonso Cano.
The same night a man originating in Puerto Tejada was entrusted to defence minister Juan Carlos Pinzón to confirm whether it really was the Supreme Commander Farc.
Search for stops
For the Sijín de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos expressed to Eliazar González at the press conference of operational services against Canoe is very important.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is a precise science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in decision-making crimes.
In addition to identification of bodies, these people help to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When they are caught, a lot of delicts present false documents or don’t have any papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in the case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief was arguing to pull the safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to pick up prints, but in this case we could get a full-hand print and identify the criminal who participated in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or withdraw suspects in the case of a murder.
Recently they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around them.
Based on the investigation, one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle prints could actually confirm it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was a real killer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
CTI’s fingerprint expert explained that the objects were "purchased using chemical or physical reactive substances".
When it appears, a transplanter or a tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is the delict database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians at the moment whose data is not provided anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as everything that is shaken is not gold, not all that you touch is still traces.
However, if it can be used, the corresponding comparison must be made.
"Remorse" protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters climbed on the Zuccotti square where they wanted to live.
Most of them waited for the order of cleaning the space and moved to the nearby park.
The members of the Wall Street Movement were provoked by New York's representatives on Tuesday, when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square with a court order, where they were taken out of the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters climbed on Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get, thanks to a court order allowing the "recommended" to relocate back to the place. The second part of the movement responded to the retreat by taking the park to the northern city where further detention took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will sit in another place and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the meetings and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman of the Wall Street Movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "displeased" to the displacement of the camp that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself ordered had reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a command banning the violent displacement of places and allowing protesters to continue to live here.
In addition, another park located on the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue crossing, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the far in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour, they managed to take the place, but then police came and some protesters were arrested. Bray didn't know the exact number, but he said he saw the trail set up to some journalists.
The organization ensures that a number of hundreds of people were settled on the site, as well as a delegation of religious leaders came to express their support and attempted to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed, a trial is expected to take place on Tuesday and during which the legality of morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to those who guarded the square, causing “some small conflicts,” Bray said, who condemned the fact that some policemen were.
The court order prohibits authorities to move members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or to use "laws that were published after the opening, or to prohibit protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used before."
Starosta Bloomberg told the press that, due to this court order, the city stopped the opening of the public space again, and the protesters warned that local laws would not allow them to return to tents and packs.
The city’s senior official personally defended the morning mobility of Zuccotti Square, an operation that arrested 200 people and joined because protesters “infringed the law”.
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the square to evacuate because it became "a place where people were not going to protest but to violate laws and in some cases to injure others" because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbours were concerned about the quality of their lives."
"The early exile was frightening and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests for the sake of the American working people," a spokeswoman said, accusing the mayor of not respecting freedom of expression.
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" Movement also said they plan to organize "great events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to remind them of two months after which the protests took place, since they began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, they will appear in the TV show "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tima Allen in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a coat in "Playboy", the wife of an annual musician Tommy Lee, and now actress and model will be Virgin Maria in a special Christmas series of Canadian television.
Private CTV station announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, and will join Virgin Mary.
CTV today has shown recordings from a television program, in which Anderson, also known for online domestic pornography, will appear with her former husband, the engine "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Leem, as Virgin Mary holding in the shelves of a lady representing Jesus.
As Joseph, Peters will appear on the scene, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who has recently served as a moderator for the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheena.
Krome Anderson and Peters will appear in a special CTV Christmas broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisano Lopilato, who is close to the controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP increases by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and thus ends the period of falls beginning in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake, which has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have calculated material losses to $300,000 million, a wound that, despite the difficult situation in the world, improves well.
After three quarters of falls, the GDP value reached such a position between July and September that it was possible to rotate the site with the definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year starting in March 2012 - predict the highest rate of growth compared to the period of January to March 2010.
Restoration can be partly explained by the purchase of machines necessary to restore areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending decreased by 0.9% compared to January to March. This is the first drop after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on an impulse that forces us to take advantage of the crisis to get out of it to reinforce or to rebuild infrastructure.
Japan was awakened. Especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
It's the Stigma.
The flows were handed over to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "reserving values" for investors who run from the euro zone debt crisis and the alarming US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony added their weak results in July until September just a yen course.
While markets continue to wear EU border countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
"We must pay attention to the risks that continue, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid rise of yean," state secretary for economic policy Motohis Furukaw said yesterday.
Actually, the perspectives aren’t really encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that most Member States reported clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts uncertainty in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It decreased by four tens to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 points in August.
The Eurozone has even reached below the average at Level 100, reaching up to Level 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says savings will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With fast and risk-free border guarantees and uncertainty, Greece has been increasingly engaged in a labyrinth that leads to a rise from the big debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "deal" of the new transitional Greek government is given rather the demands of Brussels than the true conviction of political forces, begins to be confirmed.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days he received during his appointment will likely be short for their application, the President of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new savings measures would not be made in any case.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the 26th October summit," Papadimos said during the parliamentary debate, which will be held by the vote on the confidence of the government tomorrow.
The package with 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samarase message does not explain doubts about his position: "We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have no longer committed to anything else."
The Chairman of the Conservatives went a little far away in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations have to unlock 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he said he would not support or sign any commitments regarding the implementation of savings measures.
The European Commission, which has already scattered the impact of Papandre’s referendum play, stressed yesterday that its requirements are insurmountable: it does not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign a "written commitment without bilinguality and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the Trinity will return "very soon" to Athens and will deal with the new government about "what needs to pay sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek army has a moment to get out of.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain's primary position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "have achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "the instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind."
The Queen yesterday launched the fifth global micro-lending summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operations "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals that have set the number of people's targets by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsible", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which lasts until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capabilities and opportunities for those who are the most destined for the poorest and especially those who are the poorest."
"We've already achieved a lot," and "a lot of challenges are still in front of us."
The micro-lending summit should not only be a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support the "fundamental goals".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is to ensure that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 100 million families are over the threshold of poverty under which they are currently living.
The concept of micro-lending spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "which was issued by a pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus," the queen said, and added that it was "a act of justice and the necessary recognition."
The father of the instrument described it as a "admirable idealist who went on the way to fight poverty." He met his work 15 years ago when he went to Bangladesh to meet his loan policy directly on site.
The first global summit in Washington and the next meeting in 1999, such as the Coast of Elephants, in Canada in 2006, "In all these meetings, I was able to notice the constant development, explained the queen, who, thanks to her support to this project, used the title of the "slave of the Valladoli family" with her.
Queen Sofia concluded her presentation by inviting participants to participate in discussions and searching for solutions, allowing them to continue fighting poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, stated that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to be governed by all democratic states.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balohobyt period, as this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans are a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, the governments of developed countries have to work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and do not allow solidarity to become victims of crumbs.
For Spain, microloans are one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secret for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving confidence to people whose doors are closed by everyone else. Starosta Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in the city who "open their gates, which is the spirit of solidarity."
CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general voting law
Without serious difficulties for the Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel took place on Monday, November 14, in Lipsk the first day of the Congress of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU).
The issue of the future of Europe for the programme was not originally, but it became until autumn, especially to be satisfied by members of the party who consider the policy of the government today to the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow to the Italians as Laxians.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted.
Only nine out of the number of 1001 delegates were opposed and 10 delegates were abstented.
A few-minute ovaries come to the end of Angela Merkel's presentation and after a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubla, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubts.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarized in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less than Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
According to the Chancellor in Europe, the time has come for changes.
This could be expressed by changes in the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the Eurozone Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general electoral right "to give Europe a single face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Similarly, the delegations with a large majority refused the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the headquarters of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in the strengthening of Germany’s weight.
The chancellor made several links to Conrad Adenauer and Helmuth Kohl, but did not attempt to get a congress of "small" European countries or of countries in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal relating to Europe focuses on one point of importance of "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Just indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, she had a bloody battle at Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic Army.
What is fraud in inability to work?
Following support, the UMP and the government have launched an offensive against labour inability.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, and will visit the Social Support Authority, where he will speak on a recurring topic since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As a companion of this offensive, which is based on the will of savings in the context of increased rigidity, but is not less clear from the right presidential campaign, the right majority wants to focus on labour inability.
First, due to budget savings, the government intends to introduce a fourth day of disability to private sector employees before they start taking aid in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, a sick employee would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
Measures that risk a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring €280 million.
And also measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic achievement: giving state employees one day unemployed unemployed (to date they have no unemployed compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are subject to discussion, the right majority also launches a theme of fraud aimed at this time on labour inability-related arrangements.
"The controls will be much wider and, in addition,: if you are lifted, you'll be back," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with the RTL station on Sunday, November 13.
Like in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat unreasonable in view of the facts of iniquity in the case of work inability.
In fact, they have been subject to continuous monitoring since 2002 and to political efforts that have brought their fruit.
France is not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to Caisse National d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million per day were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 they represented a daily refund of 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% of the maternal contributions and employment injuries were concerned, and 54% of the employment injuries, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of healthcare costs.
According to Alma Consulting, France had an average of 14.5 working days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
An average that hides in itself certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on Monster.com’s job opportunities websites showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees responded to no job inability.
Another study, this time conducted by the health insurance institutions, indicates that 37.8% of labour inactivity was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% from longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are not more likely to work in any other way.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the CNRS (International Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (for health reasons or not) varys between 10% and 11.8% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Foolishness at work inability is only a very small part compared to work on black.
When it comes to fraud, these are only a small range.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic controls aimed at working inability for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that at 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term "unlawful or too long-term" inability, i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled inactivity for more than 45 days, 11% of "unjustified or unauthorized" cases were calculated to 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unlawful" cases for several million employees who were unemployed.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this number would represent 9 to 15 billion euros missing in taxation per year, i.e. more than the total amount of day-to-day refunds and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to restore its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke these words to Parliament and added that a hundred days given to his government of unity will not be sufficient to fulfill this task.
"In order to rebuild our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the head of the government said in a statement on Wednesday, when he spoke his first public speech at the opening of a vote on trust in the parliament.
The application of the decisions adopted on 27 October at the summit of the euro area will be the "main task" of the new government as our country participates in the euro area.
As a result, Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "about 9%" of gross domestic product from now to the end of the year after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The law refuses new savings measures
The right leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the already approved action to try to escape the debt crisis, but noted that his party does not undertake any additional savings.
"We will not take the hand for any new action," Samaras said in a meeting with MPs on his side of New Democracy.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and fighting loss, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written warranty of all parties to support the expected measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word would be sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, the Commission of Experts says.
According to the Canadian Royal Society, the Canadians have been denied death.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is an idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions under which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive reports of the Royal Canadian Society, which included six experts working in different areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the criminal law in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, if such choice is necessary for a patient considered competent to take such decisions.
Initially, experts cited a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada was placed at 10th place, the study notes that "medicalization of death in Canada has caused a culture where people are afraid to talk about death."
Medicalisation yes or not, 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, experts report to us with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die at home, most Canadians, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average applies to all Canada, while in the province of Québec, this is the highest number with 86% of people who died in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, reporters come to the conclusions against the position of the federal government, who has already said that the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also undergone control of all countries where these approaches are legalized or are not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in application, i.e. in practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or non-consensual.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday at the teleconference more than a number of cases of these overthrows in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Aid suicide is also committed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are favored by euthanasia
Let’s remember that, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia does not mean we are sending a message that the lives of elderly or hendicated people are less expensive.
When it comes to persons practicing assisted suicide, 41% of respondents judge that they should not be judged in court.
When it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, reports writers.
They also suggest that in the list of their recommendations, the criminal law indicates that the derogation from the treatment for which there is legally confirmed rejection is not criminal.
The Commission of Experts also requires that professional doctors be trained to respect the obligation to reject treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal proceedings.
In the case of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, specialist in medical law, qualified the position of experts-signaries of the report as "extreme" because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia on the sick in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old may ask him to help commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who studied a summary of the news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also emphasizes that it looks like the authors of the reports build the autonomy of people over all other values that create a social predecessor of society.
“In society, they say, there are warning brands and restrictions.”
Margaret Somerville, a medical expert in law, also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report which she qualified as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the report on the lack of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordanian King calls for President Assad to resign
Damascus talks about the "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar al-Assad’s protesters protested before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday diplomatic pressures on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who resists them with the support of Russia and speaks of a "complot" against his country.
Two days after the cessation of Syria’s membership in the Arab Liga, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syrian neighbouring countries, have adopted an opinion in favour of the departure of President Assad.
Yesterday, Jordanian King Abdallah II was the first ruler of the Arab state to invite President Bashar al-Assad to Syria, where about forty civilians and military members of the regime were killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country, he would have to give up, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syria's political life," said King Jordan, Syrian neighbouring country, in an interview to the BBC.
At his side, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts devoted to Turkish mediation in the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year were not crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in the Middle East in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, they will leave," he said in a strike on neighbouring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly applying the harder line.
The United States was pleased to strengthen the consensus against Assad and the irreproachable action of the Syrian regime after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The International Community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying a more and more tough tone" against Syria's repression, said Mark Toner, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed by shooting and focused shooting from heavy locomotives in the city of Jobar in the Homs area.
However, at the press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouall estimated that the country had "departed for a way out of the crisis."
Finally, he reacted lively to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus membership, which, according to him, represents a "dangerous step".
"Syria is unfaithful," he added, ensuring that "complots against Syria will not succeed."
After its decision to suspend the membership of Syria, the Arab League is currently considering the "mechanism of civilian protection" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favored by the idea of sending UN observers to assist in protecting civilians against the repression of the regime that he believes is "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League will be called for tomorrow in Rabatu to put an opinion on the crisis-solving plan, which was decided on 2 December, in which particularly the withdrawal of the army from the towns of the protests and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov considered the decision of the Arab League to be "faulty" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but at the same time completely avoided support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices in Italy
The next Italian government chief Mario Monti asked markets for a bit of time to be able to form his team and start applying a program that will contain the "victims" in order to regain the trust lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting representatives of trade unions and employers today.
It should be composed of a relatively narrow cabinet consisting of technocrates not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary group members of the talks, after a meeting with the designated Prime Minister.
Mr Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Parliament, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for confidence on Friday to make sure that the new government has adequate support.
Mario Monti will end with a small team of Prime Minister Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented on the financial markets and asked for time.
In "Democracy applies precise terms" as to the preparation of the government and its programme, he emphasized and added that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was initially favourable to the markets, but concerns emerged again after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area.
The nominated Prime Minister should build a team that includes mainly technocracy, although he stressed that he would like to accept "policy".
He expressed his conviction that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the next election date.
According to the President of the House of Ambassadors, Gianfranc Fini, the new government will gain confidence in Parliament until Friday.
Mario Monti promised to deal with an extraordinary emergency and to make Italy again a strong article of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing with the new government.”
The European Union is convinced that despite the savings plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its balanced budget objective and require new hard action.
The boss of the Confindustri entrepreneurial alliance Emma Marcegaglio, who meets Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to restore the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "professor" symbolizes according to the authors of "the call to seriousness" and "other Italy", represents for Italy "epic change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
There will be a great unknown lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections as Italy has to place debt for 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Soviet scientists helped Iran’s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon detonator, a U.S. non-governmental organization specialized in nuclear risks announced Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) and other documents unique to the UN Agency.
Last week, MAAE announced its "great concern" about the "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, V. Danilenko (nr. 1934) had been working for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Centre in Čeljabinsk (Ural), where he had to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds with the explosion method.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre had to leave to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he had to cooperate in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the MAAE reminds "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on "the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew well this method, but who - as one Member State informed the agency - worked during a substantial part of his work career on this technology within the military nuclear programme."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence at the same time decreased slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% rise by 13% in the case of violence against Catholics, 4% in the case of crime against Jews and 14% in the case of anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which, according to the FBI, were motivated by racial differences and 20% of religious differences.
"After the loss of 2009, it is uncomfortable to see these crimes and crimes rising again," the Human Rights First, who is dealing with human rights, stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre said.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these evils," he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hate crimes."
"Hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the inheritance of the time of the fight for civil rights.
This rule was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin, and now and sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter’s microblogging service website made changes in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, which is somewhat similar to its Facebook services.
The new offers "activity" and "name" allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or whose responses ("tweets") are you.
This allows you to know whether you can track posts, whether you log in to new accounts, whether you have favorite posts, etc.
This new Twitter face was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokesman Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms slightly incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's contribution, followfriday for recommander de seguir un autre user) making the happiness of the initiations, opens as well as a plus large public with a maniement plus comparable to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately in their "tweets" evaluate the importance of this innovation differently.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” says @jemb123.
“Activity function helps me better track some elements of my Twitter,” @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
the entry of a golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to enroll a "gold rule" budgetary policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austria’s rating agencies (AAA).
He was Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced this decision on the conclusion of the Minister’s advice in a situation where Austria’s public debt is 74.6% high above its maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest rates for three billion euros more every year,” said MFP and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Accordingly, Austria is based on the request of the summit of the euro area countries held in Brussels, 26 October 2011, where the heads of states and governments strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be entered into the Constitution or the law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017, the federal government’s public structural deficit will not be forced to exceed 0.35% of GDP every year, while federal countries and municipalities will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to achieve public debt under the 60 % criterion set out by the Maastricht Treaty in the 2020/21 period.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in currencies
Japanese Prime Minister Yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to re-invade the currency markets if only they would continue to strengthen.
"We're going to bet on how we did the last time, if we're going to find out too much instability," the jean exchange rate explained to the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, he was only again raised to the historical values forced by the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
This day, Tokyo sold jeans for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has only recently exceeded the record of the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since then, he has risen regularly in support of the purchases of investors who consider it a “safe port” in the uncertain times of the world’s economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar again received under 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell under the symbolic chain of 105 yen near the level of last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of about 120 yen and the euro had more than 160 yen.
This inflation affects island exports as it increases the price of products made in Japan and reduces the value of the revenue obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when transferring them to domestic currency.
"Japan is recovered" from the destruction caused by March's earthquake and the waves of tsunami, which deployed the region of Tohoka in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this betrayal of the jean will not yet be killed in the egg of a cruel recovery.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to a survey of export growth and household consumption loaded by disaster.
But the Prime Minister decided that the high value of the jean did not reflect the “national economy of Japan”.
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ) to launch a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to weakening the jeans.
But the multi-governmental institution Hirohide Yamaguchi noted that BoJ had already adopted "three measures" indicating that no additional monetary weakness can be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Institute increased its purchases by 5,000 billion (EUR 47 billion) and increased to 55,000 billion (EUR 519 billion) of amounts to purchase different securities in order to float with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of debt crisis is still undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of governments in Greece and Italy and the better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms are still worried about the stability of the euro area today, which will fall into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax Index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and 0.1% in London.
“With new tensions around the euro area’s lending revenue, which is in trouble, markets with shares around the world continue to bear only part of recent profits.”
“Nervos investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, broker of IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo closed with a decrease of 0.7%, which suffered due to market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to deal with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes over Europe and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” says Mitsušige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This restart of uncertainty about the future of the euro area will harm the currency itself, which will continue to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at the lowest level since a month and a half.
In 10 hours, the European currency is $1,3570 at a drop of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency covered after the CDU party, Chancellor Angela Merkel, adopted a proposal on Monday to leave the euro area for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond 6%
The interest rates for loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying amount.
This morning, the revenue of Italian decade bonds is 6.85% and the revenue of Spanish decade bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to strengthen market participants’ concerns.
The head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, insisted on the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the amount of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the summit of the eurozone will be "the main task" of his government.
Spain is re-established in an intentional market direction when elections are held in the country on Sunday to the House of Parliament.
The difference between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
In the expectation of numbers reporting growth in the euro area
Statistics say that in the third quarter, France has seen economic growth by 0.4% due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.43%.
However, the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE reviewed down the number in the second quarter to decrease by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that the economy is worried most.
During the same period, Germany had a 0.5% growth.
The first estimates for the euro area are expected at 11 hours, while the European Commission has just noticed the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must win over dogma
If there is a topic that cannot be understood on the basis of short-term disputes or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural that the meeting at the elections is an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must establish their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments have already doubled demand for electricity by 2050, unless we want to get rid of a significant part of the world’s population.
At the same time, there will be a need to face a lack of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to combat climate change, which is the topic that is currently leaving environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
This is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case of Belgium, which undermines its decision to find another source capable of substituting itself, nor Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only last generation power plants.
On the contrary, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite at least some countries, continue with commitment in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by reconstruction of the building of one power plant suspended after an accident of Three Mile Island power plant.
If a German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is resisting.
Berlin’s election will be demonstrated by the withdrawal of the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported in particular from Russia, and a steady increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and carbon power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt in a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of carbon and gas due to wind irregularity, causing the emissions of CO2 and Danish electricity prices to be 65% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the invariableness of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity bill by 40% higher than how much French households pay.
While in a globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of the industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the advantages of the most precious electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant decline in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a significant rise in electricity price, which would make an illustrative beautiful statement on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of the French refuses to pay, as will not basically be against this energy, as evidenced by surveys of public opinion.
Let’s remember that our country’s energy policy has enabled the construction of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 emerging jobs.
The strongly exporting industry draws large amounts of small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs that cannot be transferred to abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small and medium-sized number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would cost 6 billion euros a year that the countries acquire for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to work for 60 years, while its manufacturer’s fault would be planned?
To resolve the energy equation, it is necessary to admit that there is no magical source for energy production, since there is no devil.
The development of low-CO2 production facilities, nuclear facilities and renewable energy facilities carried out by the French AREVA Industry Group demonstrates complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Authority for Nuclear Safety, which is carrying out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionality is recognized have the idea of blood safety.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island was in normal operating conditions and remained without human victims and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, drama caused the concept of the reactor and unexpected human errors.
In the Fukushima case, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons from this accident as it did in two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between French and German nuclear security authorities, operators and builders is that the EPR-type reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all stakeholders who want to build a nuclear power plant consider it to stop its construction in Flamanville, it would be a great gift offered to AREVA and EDF competitors and the release of their way to strengthen their leadership position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and machinations manage the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy undertaken by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various corners - police, courts and administrations undertaken the number policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the country of human rights", which France praises.
Recently it was an administrative disturbance that was the object of foreign students who became current when the Interior Minister (see the letter of 23 May Libération) stated that France "is not in need of foreign talents, guards and servants."
But so far, it has rarely been scattered in the context of the economy.
It is necessary to say that in this area there is a fairly broad correspondence between left and right.
In 1976, Jacques Chirac stated that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million immigrants work" and on Michel Rocard's left when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the world's violence."
The only difference is the degree of greatness.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish installers in the French territory was shared on the right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden to the economy and to the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greatness that we can afford to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande is restricted to banality, stating that joint development will allow us to solve our "immigration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalled in their recently published work synthesising the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): there is a wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigration movements, and on the economic impact of migration.
Immigration limits growth and harms employment.
The concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create pressure on reducing their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than substitutes for French employees by doing jobs in sectors with a lack of employees.
There are few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which education is not sufficient for jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, it will be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this supplementation between France and migrants causes the arrival of immigrants to have a positive impact on salary and the employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% leads to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9 percent.
However, the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of thoughts and economic growth (the high share of naturalized immigrants between American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also a net contributor of social systems in European countries, on average, 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old immigrant in Germany will bring a net contribution to public budgets throughout his lifetime (on income minus expenditure) 150000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy said at the beginning of his mandate the desire to come for the missing percentage of growth "with precious teeth".
The teeth used to reflect immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to be considered a European democracy
Democracy is rare and very rare.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century it experienced a tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulags, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and Colonels in Greece.
Some people could believe that in order to triumph over their enemies, it would be enough to make the elections and do it in the best possible manner.
However, it has been known since Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The general right to vote, although it is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "output tool", as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of division and control of power, education, illumination, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we experience is a economic crisis, but it has been since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The confession of the Greek referendum of no-no will have the value of double revelation in this direction: the revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the revelation of an alarming feeling of its impotence, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democracy have moved today and that many Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can’t get anything if we require a number of national referendums organized according to the needs and disorganized.
Bianco exposed to the European absolutist monarch or jumping bound to the empty nationalist depths: what choice for a citizen!
No, we don't want gilotine knives, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous performance of election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop counting - because the crisis is in Europe.
In fact, it is the whole Europe facing the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its inability and lack of solidarity.
It is a whole Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We disagree with the transfer of supremacy to Europe - but it is the whole Europe that slowly loses its supremacy and with each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project of democratic supremacy.
Because only together, Europeans will be able to reduce their debt rates, get rid of market governments and prepare for the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will assume that decisions at European level, which will not be able to be adopted without complete democratic legitimacy, would otherwise lead us to disruption.
After we have long fought against this proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delors, all today are demanding a strong demand for the European economic government.
Wake up.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, experienced as such citizens, would be a new foolishness and a new blind street.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
The revolution in the interests of this could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This will only be possible by building Europe more politically democratic and genuinely democratic European supremacy.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards spread
In an optimistic atmosphere, it will be opened on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris World Cup of Chip Cards.
In 2011, Eurosmart cabinet said it would end up increasing global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable segment is a contactless technology that allows you to pay in public transport or make purchases by just approaching a card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards will be sold around the world against 320 million cards sold a year earlier!
Their shares should continue to increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC countries, Europe gains a land in contact payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 non-contact Visa cards have been issued.
But large business chains work for two.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million non-contact cards Pass MasterCard.
In order to rank a higher speed level, it is necessary that the banks provide their customers with them from now on.
"Two major French companies have committed themselves to distribute systematically to their customers in the future without touching bank cards," said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology needed to carry out transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They got delays."
"But their real differences should happen next year."
"For 2012, we estimated their sales in the world to 80 to 120 million units," said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
The banks are already preparing ahead.
The Crédit Agricultural Bank announced the launch of a test conducted in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a free-to-contact payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société générale announced yesterday that she is preparing to introduce an offer allowing her customers to pay without touch on mobile phones.
Terrorism from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about connections between Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are al-Qaeda terrorist groups in Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "acquired certainty about it from now on."
"The way both organizations operate, and reports of information services show that there is a large cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
Paris seems to have similar analysis.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Nigeria in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting boards.
After the AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during the operation carried out by special French units.
In courts after the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Division
Analysis of calls leads to several people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to Nigeria, which has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is a friend of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to have close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but it’s definitely necessary to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect is enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it is increasingly active,” Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, this "support" has been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's development and expressions or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as AQMI's devices.
Since then, the international community has developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems encountered by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram secta was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of Haoussa means "Western education is sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirat in the Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, such connections have a rapid success.
The sect is politician and requires strict compliance with Islamic law of the Sharia, while its followers are starting to fight the central government.
These people are focused first on castles, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram members become extremely active and tolerate their attacks on police stations.
The government’s reaction is always the same as usual.
The army surrounded the city and resulted in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has radicalized and left its work in the north.
In 2010, an assassination in the city of Jos, where 80 people are killed, followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police during its first suicide attack.
In August, the U.N. will be the first international tournament.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritius through Nigeria to Somalia, is now concerned with all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb surrounds Mali and the games and Somalis of the Al-Shabab Movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is revealed as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in an interview with President Goodluck, Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is in a state of willingness and is ready to "transmit all information".
The world according to candidates for the president
In matters related to China, Iran or Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are predominantly simplifying and unknown.
Can America manage the world of weakened crisis using simple or even simplifying ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, voters could think of it.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and others reiterate the shameful statements and short instructions on foreign policy, which are traditionally the strong point of Republicans.
Often, unfounded slogans about China, Iran or Israel’s help are breaking down.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the nomination industry of the Republican Grand Old Party, threatened by calling Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accusing them of "for manipulation of their currency", which is a substantial theme in America for the migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse if this has to include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate with some sophisticated foreign policy vision, has almost stopped in a position that "consents" the emotions.
He required a strong, but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is at last in the election estimates, remains unfair.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," Fanfaronsky said.
“If Obama is re-electioned, they will have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of disappointing his duties with this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second most prominent candidate, demonstrates the stupid ignorance of the documents.
Recently, he called for an acute position against the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capacity" - an obviously unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants attacks on Iran, says he is ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cainam, Perry and another candidate Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far from Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, heavily heavy in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple thoughts and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the departure of "boys" from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya and thus condemned him as a label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses the national security policy of President Obama, which removed Ben Ladina, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to strike.
And with the arguments that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscite its leading position, Obama is talking to a better place.
Nord Stream, the new port of Russian gas into Europe
The remote Nord Stream gas pipeline that drank directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led under the Baltic Sea began to work.
They have to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian gas turbine, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of states and governments, participated in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
The symbolic German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedov, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte, together round the control valve around the Russian gas entry into the Western European network.
This new gas pipeline begins to flow to western Europe every year with the first 1,224 km-long pipeline linking the region of Petrohrad to the federal country of Mecklemburgs-Pomoryana.
The second pipe to be completed by the end of 2012 will allow for a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, which is the amount equal to the whole French consumption.
And it is already reminded of the possibility of building the third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
The project was strongly protested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will actually allow the supply of gas directly to Germany without being transported by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
In fact, these two countries are losing somewhat of power: the possibility of pushing Russia by threats to close access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed it strongly when she refused to compare the Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with a appeal to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater certainty of its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is at the price of weakening Europe of energy, as the project created a trail between Europeans from the east to the west.
Russia failed to enjoy its vision of the direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose beds are closer to their end.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new pine that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of this gas pipeline, demonstrating at which point large gas contracts are both politically and economically.
This explains the wide smile of the leading representatives of Gazprom present in a large number in Lubmin, the gas input site.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical factor.
The submarine tube is made of steel with concrete cloth to be protected from sea vessels.
It counts on the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid mining fields originating in the era of World War II.
"For safety, almost a hundred have had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Müller, spokeswoman of Nord Stream.
Measures to protect the fauna and flora were also needed.
The pipe itself is a long metal bird weighing as 242 Eiffels, which has no interrupted valves or maintenance stations at all its length.
One control area had to be built near Sweden, but the project leader refused it when the Swedish people were only a little wanting to see the Russian state company as it permanently settled on their coast.
"In case of deficiency, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In the event of inaccuracies, the gas contained in the gas pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case the builder is considered unlikely, since the screws were designed to create incontinence once every 100,000 years.
The external control of the gas pipeline is carried out by a submarine robot loaded by the vessel, while the interior of the gas pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This 1 meter diameter smoke-shaped device is inserted into the interior of the pipe and is pressured by gas.
In the goal after three days of the road, the speed of 3 m/s will provide accurate information about possible deformation of metal parts.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to work for fifty years without needing a smaller self-repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bars per start and 100 bars per target.
For the implementation of the project, five companies combined the powers.
The leader remains in Gazprom, holding a share of 51%.
The German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
The company has its headquarters in Zoug, Switzerland, where the tax is extremely affordable.
Gazprom subsequently rented this company for a five-year contract that can be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Gasprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whether the quantity of real-life gas is any," explains Jens Müller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% of shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be refunded, as only Gazprom takes the risk on themselves.
Gas pipe comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with borovic forests.
The valves of 4,5 meters form the output gate of the gas.
The sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before being transported into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When achieving full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand recorder
The Italian company Moleskine, founded 50 years ago, wants to be happy with writing again.
It brings the smell of adventure, watches spent writing in a light candle.
The Moleskine recorder is easily distinguished by its black tiles and white leaves sent as old ages.
The Moleskine recorder, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan at the time decides to market a new design but distinctive recorder.
Maria Sebregondi, then a business-working consultant, is interested in introducing a new product.
The recorder is inspired by the old manufacturing technique "moleskin" (leather imitation), which is used for example to adjust the surface of lavish.
This type of record was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has returned to the love of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the leader of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% to reach 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is a remote hidden production from the first years when only 3,000 recorders were built.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create some artificial portrait of a buyer, as the recorder takes business as well as a student or professional.
The image of Moleskine’s recorder is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
A small Italian company, who had 12 employees at its beginnings, has almost 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his records to the bookstore and through the FNAC store chain to small boutiques in the center of cities where he was able to use his identity.
“We have tracked the spirit of time and this need for a new writing through the storm of e-mail development,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine recording: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their recording.
In August, at the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also introduced new recording boards that resemble the Leopard.
Moleskine benefites from its success and this cultural aur and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, shirts, portable stickers ... The brand expands to a variety of carriers.
Success that raised jealousy: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed unemployed workers?
About 19% of people are looking for a job.
Today, it opens for the 15th week for the employment of Hendikep.
Due to the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it calling?
“No, he stressed Éric Blanchet, the Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for Employment of Hendicapedes.”
"The steps achieved in 15 years are remarkable."
“The percentage of unemployed was not twice, but three times higher.”
“There is still a lot to do.”
It is to be said that for unemployed, unemployed persons there are numerous obstacles before they arrive at work.
This is an elderly person: 37% is over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% has no maturity, and from 2.3 million high school students, only 10,000 are eligible.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in the hendicated compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria which particularly complicate the return to employment and which represent the core of the problem, according to Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin Association, founded in 1992, to help businesses take care of hired workers.
So much about objective brakes.
It remains unthinkable, ways of thinking that will certainly evolve, but too slow.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité Association found that the questioned managers have a "small level of knowledge of the indicted persons" with a "excessive idea of people on a dining chair and mental or mental deficiencies".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the goals of employing 6% of employees laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 are equal to 2.6%.
“We are now moving about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, who is entrusted to pick up fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof is that the number of "penned" companies, as well as the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, fell from 59,000 most criminal companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates true consciousness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees are employed by deployed workers, compared to 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45) the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were not hiding the pleasures that would bring them this friendly competition.
We don't go so far to write that there was a gathering between them, but the picture is symbolic.
The seats next to the Stade de France court were shortened and well reconciled by Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach gave his player only words of praise.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even though he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," says the player of the French Lille.
When it comes to the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it is the same, he justifies.
"I've been in Lille all year round, which is not a case with Belgium."
"I need to clean my brand."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "speak".
It is impossible to remember the concept of "joy".
Play against Bleus, who has been encouraged for seven years and in their winnings in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This will necessarily contribute even more to the “special” character of this meeting.
More about it, because in the opposite way they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he reminds.
"We crossed immediately."
"I can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Leekens also recalled “heroest.”
"Hrdost" defeat "safety - celebration".
"Hrdost" also notes in the quality of neighbors that France has become a very high team for more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna."
“Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work,” he said.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see in 2014 on a flight with France direction... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians will become big,” he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're aware of it for the next matches." Including that against France.
Portugal very self-confidence
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts with great optimism on Wednesday in Lisbon against Bosnia (22h00).
The two teams missed realism on their journey.
At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and especially a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese football representation, whose cormidle has been in 2010, has been qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal actually divides from happiness 90 minutes.
One match remains and one opponent – Bosnia.
With the consciousness of the Friday result (0-0) in the Hell of Bosnia Zenice, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of oversight, but was unable to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
“It’s a good result that, however, contains risk because we didn’t give goals outside.”
But at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will move ahead of the audience, which should create a screw coat there, even though the match is definitely like a "very balanced," says the optimist, but he is deliberately thinking of Bento.
“We expect a very balanced match, but we are fully convinced that we can have a design,” a twenty-four-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We still have 50% chances to be on Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz said.
The non-decisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to set goals and win.
An uncertain match can be enough for the Bosnians who also need to give a goal.
“It’s a good result, however, that has a risk because we didn’t give our goals outside,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual qualities,” he added.
Just as in Zenica, Portugal will have an interest in developing the Bosnian team right from the beginning, so that they don’t give them time to think.”
A good idea, provided that this time it appears to be realistic.
