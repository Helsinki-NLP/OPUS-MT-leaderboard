18-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco’s store
The eighty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the stairs of the local store this week.
But the brother of the victim says that he doesn’t think who wants to hurt him, and adds, “Finally, he has begun to hurt him.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighty-eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of a lawyer said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was formerly a series of chefs in Boston, had earned his work as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Speaker at Sons & Daughters said his death was “shocked and destroyed”.
“We have a small team working as a closely connected family, and we will miss too much,” he said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first slept in hostels, but that recently "it finally began to give him."
“He found an apartment, he went with a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a loving soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to join his family, he always cooked us dinner, made us dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any disputes.
He was the brother who took things as they were.
“And if everything else in the world was bad, he was the unbroken diamond that shine every day,” he said.

The Czech roads have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, government carriers have invested over 31 billion krone in modernisation of vehicles.
One-third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts of modernisation in each year, with the exception of 2012, are gradually declining.
The Czech roads have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion krone in the last six years.
One-third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The spending money was shown to reduce the average age of two years in locomotives and separate units and six years in classical wagons.
The larger share of investment was given to the carriers in regional transport, to which about 60 percent of the money was targeted, and 40 percent invested in refurbishment vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of the locomotive and unit is currently 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles would not be calculated, the average age of driving vehicles would increase by 10 years.
There are a bit older personal wagons on average, the average age of which is 23 years of age when it comes to modernization.
If only age was taken into account from the date of production, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
The classical systems consisting of cars and locomotives, however, have gradually disappeared from Czech and global railroads in recent years and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive was from 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic cars also decreased from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the transporter got rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking openings during driving.
From January to July, 110 of these vehicles were allowed.
For example, from investments planned to carry out in the vehicle park, it is possible to specify the purchase of 50 cars for a speed of up to 200 km/h that the carrier plans to install on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electrical units for domestic fast-track routes.
The contract counts up to 30 engines and 20 electric units.
Four-year-old officials know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of the online journal Aktualmente.cz is watching the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which is now attracting motorists to visit June, where it is not only touristically interesting walking in the trees crowns, but also the Olympic park.
Road managers know that there's noise, but they're saying they can't do anything.
There are hundreds of similar advertisements across the country, perhaps thousands.
According to officials, there is a caller law on the guilt, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards right away.
First, a complex bureaucratic wheel is needed.
Meanwhile, the company will change its name and the office will be short.
Or just push the advertisement for a few meters and the official process must start again.
The management of roads and roads a fourth year ago admitted: at the headquarters of the Czech Budějovic in Lipno stands on our territory near the state road advertising billboard.
Not even three months, but officials were not enough to get rid of the unauthorized portable structures with huge advertising posters.
It doesn't matter to anyone that he's standing right next to the car, in a fifty-meter protective zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers claim that the billboard can't just be consulted because of the dirty law.
Maybe he's forced him and take him away.
"We can't just allow this," said Nina Ledvin, spokeswoman of the Road and Road Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must be prevented by law.
The case of this specific billboard, whose fate began online watching in detail in the spring Actually.cz, while it is not unique and indicates a general problem that can’t be addressed effectively and quickly by the authorities.
Only in the southern Czech Republic, the edition counted dozens of similar mobile ads located against the rules close to or close to the car.
Similarly, there are other countries.
"We have difficulty forced the company to remove the passengers," confirms the chief of the transportation committee of the Czechobudjevo district office Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to Claudia, there is a law of burning on the guilt that officials bind.
First of all, the owner of the billboard has to make it difficult to turn off the advertisement.
However, boss companies are often uncomfortable or know the fint that has already been described in the past, when the problem has begun to be more detailed: just a mobile standalone with an advertisement is enough to move a few meters and officials can put the previous challenge to remove black advertising into the basket.
This is because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinator suddenly disagrees, they look at it as a new device and we have to talk to the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The amendment could have introduced a new law that will prohibit billboards on roads from September next year and limits them even on roads I. class.
Critics point out that the rules for counteracting illegal and easily transferable advertisements remain the same as today.
And the offices don't hurt so much.
Companies can earn tens of hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal rentals, and no one can.
For example, a billboard that attracts Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the Czech Republic magistrate currently runs three administrative procedures for the billboards built yesterday.
The company is in danger of a three-million punishment in every procedure.
These are more advertisements that have been placed in the road I. class protection zone without permission.
The management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mraz, the Chief of the Transportation Committee of the Czech Republic Magistrate.
Advertising, which is interested in Aktualmente.cz, however, has not yet figured out among these cases, will soon come to them, but it is most likely to come to them.
According to HR spokesman Nina Ledvin, the company did not respond to repeated written challenges to eliminate, so the case will get to the table of the country and probably to the magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard belongs to suspected companies that are unable to contact.
He did not receive the mail and the official headquarters of Žižkov has been cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail went to Southern entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who made a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard rentals and offers them to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
At the same time, this spring, when the HRSD began to start an initiation Aktualmente.cz for advertising in Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is allegedly newly based.
None of the road managers have been invited from this address so far.
It's a lost fight.
Similar silence or unclear changes of seats are not unusual.
A few years ago, one company was gradually punished for two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ICU and there was nothing to deal with.
The executive returned the case, the advertisements continued, perhaps elsewhere.
We are quite powerful against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight against windmills, admitting one of the officials under the condition of maintaining anonymity.
No one has yet to deal with the new law in this regard.
At the moment, Mrs.F. has spoken to several members who have suffered a problem.
So far, they haven't developed any activity.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards in main Czech communications appeared.
The government refused it.
Billboards are not only for national, but also for rural and municipal policies very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On one side they know about social demand for their limitations, on the other side they need them themselves for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stop the relatively introduced impression that if something doesn't work, we need to change the laws.
This year, farmers will lower less grain, but more grains and mosquitoes, estimate statistics.
According to the Czech Statistical Authority, the crop of cereals will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s fruit has exceeded the average over the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, it will be higher the rice drop (of 3.9 percent) and the mask (2.5 percent).
This year, the seeds will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Farmers cut 7.2 million tons of grain.
This results from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Authority on 15 July.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic and assumed a decade-long decline against the last month.
Last year's seeds were over average.
This year's fruit has exceeded the average over the last five and ten years.
In contrast, this year will be higher than the rice and mosquito.
The crops drop by 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they got under the roof of 1.256 million tonnes.
This year’s fruit may be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The expected decline in grain production is due to a decrease in hectare revenue by 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the eastern area.
This year, farmers earned 3% less fields.
Ozmeum wheat, which is the most important for Czechoslovakia, is estimated to decrease by 3.3% this year.
The farmers put it on more fields.
However, a lower hectare revenue will be signed to 6.04 tons.
Around five-year decline in statistics is assumed for spring juice, which is most often used in beer production.
The reduction in vegetables is worth a reduction of 15.2 per cent, but also lower hectares of income.
On the contrary, the ozone is 6.3 percent higher.
Growth of grain is also grown.
The statistical rates are estimated at 1,305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The eagles spread by 7.3 percent.
The hectare revenue will be 3.2% lower than last year.
This year’s harvest will exceed the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, while the seeds are on the surface by one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, the fields with my mother are also growing.
This year, farmers sent him to 3543 hectares.
As of 2008, when the plant grew in the Czech Republic at a record of 70,000 hectares, it was half the field.
Thanks to the expansion of the eagle surfaces this year, the mask slide will be richer.
Last year, it was 2.5 per cent to 27,423 tons.
The hectare revenue will be 6.1% lower.
Police accused two men of attacking a knife and a knife, the court sent them to prison.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a knife and a fifty-year-old man in the center of Olomouce on Tuesday.
"Although the attacked was attempting to escape, he was caused by cutting and cutting injuries required by hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both criminals were detained immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor filed the court’s request to be held in prison and the court responded to him on Friday.
Both men are in danger of three to ten years of imprisonment.
Police accused two detained of the attack of a fifty-year-old in the center of Olomouce with a knife and a knife.
The attackers caused him injury, the man ended in the hospital.
The attack occurred between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday in the right noon at the Freedom class, police said.
The smokers ended in arrest, police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková informed.
A massive break between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of Olomouce centre.
After aggressive verbal strikes, two attackers attacked with the help of a knife and a fifty-year-old man.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by cutting and cutting injuries that required hospital treatment and other treatments, police spokesman said.
At a kidnapping that drew great attention in the city centre and for which several police guards and guards had to interfere in the place, it was a family dispute.
Criminalists accused a 40-year-old man from Slovakia and a 70-year-old man from Olomouce of attempting to harm health and extortion.
The prosecutor filed the request of the court to be held in prison and the court responded to him on Friday, the spokesman added.
The machetus were used in the center of Olomouce during the mass battle also five years ago, which happened just a few tens of meters further, in front of the Varna Disco in Riegro Street.
Police said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the company's guests standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, holes and knives in their hands.
The court then sentenced two attacking foreigners with a conditional punishment.
Forgotten and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised, maybe you’re walking around them every day.
One of the four-speaking examples of the unused and empty house is the extensive building of the former IPB settlement in the middle of the Senováž Square.
She had been working as a hotel for a long time.
But it's still nothing.
The need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
What to use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Václavsky Square, there are a number of shelter houses, which despite its location, size and often even monumental protection will only be empty and empty.
Real estate in the center we have chosen using the project Holidaynédomy.com, which maps long-term empty properties in the territory of Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, unclear relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty homes in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Whether the owners pay a special tax, they want an initiative.

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax recognition.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were spent on Clinton's charity.
The majority of Clinton’s revenues – over $6 million – are for their manifestations.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The U.S. Democratic candidate for the presidential office Hillary Clinton published his tax reports on Friday, increasing pressure on his Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, AP said.
The majority of Clinton’s revenues – over $6 million – are for their manifestations, mainly from the period before April 2015 when Clinton launched its campaign before elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands took a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year and then a national and local income tax of nine percent last year.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of the income.
Trump has a similar problem, but he has not yet decided to release the tax recognition.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after his confession was released.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to the secrets around Trump’s revenue, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is actually as rich as they claim, the AP said.
Trump’s assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
The lower salary would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who, in a date with the former first lady, is nominated for the post of vice president, has today published a report on his tax withdrawals over the last ten years.

In Nigeria, the reverse has been rebuilt.
Islamists from Boko Haram defended consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, the case of children's reverse has been resumed.
In the northeast of the country, the government declared exceptional vaccinations because there were two children infected with this disease.
The vaccines brought helicopters there.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram acted, who defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was unobserved.
In the northeast of Nigeria, children will be vaccinated against the reverse because two children infected with this disease have been protected there.
In Africa, the reverse was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be injured in Borno and another four million children will be injured in the neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly transported vaccines against child reverse to the affected northeastern part of the country where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the virus had been unobserved for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram in the past defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also prevented doctors from getting into areas where children with reverse were detected.
Both disabled batolats came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly released from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, head of the WHO section, said the vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
In Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram worked for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country.
Nigerian health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of reverse are a big disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that the reverse was washed into it next year.
The WHO noted that it was possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria was half of all cases of the world’s reverse.
While in 1988 it was still reversed in 125 countries, it remains in only three regions - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and north of Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the inspired stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes who escaped from the gang of the cows.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and invited them to look into the future with confidence.
Francis wanted to highlight human trafficking and call for strengthening the fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes, which the police freed from the power of a gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church was listening to the inspired stories of fallen women for more than an hour and then urging them to look into the future with confidence, the spokesman of the Vatican said.
Among the former prostitutes he visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, they were all exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
The visitor wanted to draw attention to trafficking with people and call for strengthening the fight against them, the Pope said.
Francis often warns the fate of people on the edge of society.
For example, he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year thanks to his personal invitation in April and June.
France will hit the Djihadists.
Without the help of Muslims, it won’t work.
In the fight against radical Islamism, the Muslims themselves are helping.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vallse aims to make significant changes in the functioning of the mixtures and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 prayers and prayers.
The next one will follow, the Interior Minister said.
There are more than one hundred Djihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who disrupt public freedom, it will be harder for France to guarantee this confession of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only the Immaeans who have been educated in France are taught in prayers and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from abroad.
Currently, about 20% of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the countries of the Persian Gulf.
Even for this reason, there are preachers who can seed radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from a foreigner.
The French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
At the time, the Foundation had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosque and the countries that finance their construction.
However, the institutions soon achieved internal opposition and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls recently noted.
After the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
They all accelerated other terrorist attacks in France carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by raid Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that the new foundation will be established in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mixtures from domestic resources and also monitor the property.
At the moment it is not clear where money will be taken not only for the construction of new meshes, but also for various educational centers.
However, there are several suggestions.
One of them is a special fees or food halal tax.
In practice, the dealers would pay halal food for the provision of certification.
Some of the money would then be put into the fund’s cash.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French refugees who are going to Mexico.
Every year, about 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia for the traditional journey.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only preachers who have passed special educational programs at French universities should act in the future.
This should ensure that the ministry is in line with democracy.
The radical mosquitoes are closed.
The French government is at the same time fighting against radicals.
And the next one will follow, the Interior Minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who proclaim hate and do not respect some principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
According to estimates, there are about 2,500 mosquitoes and prayers in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have exploded about 80 children, and in several dozens of others, they are considering this.
But not everyone thinks that the steps of the government can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in the messiahs, young people radicalize themselves on the internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Centre for Scientific Research.

Young doctors press: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute about the new contract.
The Council of Youth Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask for the full advice to support further range events from early September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to resolve the treaty issues.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
58 percent of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Twitter on Thursday, President JDC Ellen McCourt said the government remained "and still calm" on issues, leading to the refusal of the contract.
"In this light, the power executive authority of the JDC has decided to completely reject the proposed new contract and request a new formal negotiation in all matters."
In response to the silence by the government today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the running programme of the run-offs of early September.
The dispute led young doctors this year to release up to six stakes, including the first general stakes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
The BMA members at the meetings before the vote of 55,000 young doctors and medical students said the deal was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean burden for medical doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: the unity of "incomparable"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal ending of eight months of speech wars and economic sanctions.
But whilst Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the overseas hall of the palace in Petrohrad, I had the impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
The hand was given, yes.
But Putin wasn’t smiling, and the heat was scarcely excited from it, even according to its measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, repeatedly spoke of his “drama friend” to Putin - five times, as one of the reports stated.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was behaving like nothing bad would ever happen.
I think his enthusiasm reflected the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold, which emitted from Putin, showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his initial speech: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft by Turkey on the Syrian borders.
Moscow’s reaction was sad at that time.
Putin spread wounds around himself and Ankara accused him of kicking a knife in Moscow.
The worse thing was that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuild real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media after months led a massive comprehensive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks could do everything.
The accusation from the top government officials was more serious that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this.
However, the official message in Petrohrad came that it was time to move further.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology that President Erdogan asked for.
Russia could also declare a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring the arrival are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost free of power last month during a failed shooting and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also been seen.
There is also an economic motive.
The Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - mainly the cancellation of charter flights, which transports several million Russian tourists annually to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, the tour operators and charter companies will breathe as soon as possible if flights are restored.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television has promised cheaper fruits and vegetables, once again importing agricultural goods from Turkey will be allowed.
“Turists there, tomatoes back here,” said the newspaper Vedemosti.
The visit had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West for what she considers to be a chaba’s response to the attempt to overthrow.
In addition, the long-lasting fraudulentness of the long-term talks about the entry into the EU and the entry of Putin - which pushes to take advantage of the cooling and overthrow Turkey's and the West's footsteps.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after attempting to shoot.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted with fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So, the summit in this pompous, naval palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to present what one of the analysts described me as “the unity of incompatibles”: how they combine the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
However, despite the public demonstration of mutual reconciliation, there are significant differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey are on the opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three-hour introductory talks, both presidents at the press conference said they had not mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately answered the question about differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common speech on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot a Russian fighter plane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak together at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand must be suppressed into the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland station that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She lost when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer finance.
They have spent millions of pounds on international sports sponsorship, from the Six Nations ragby championship to Winbled champion Andy Marraye.
But now it has been decided that it is better to get more out of national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the centers and stock encoding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the brand Ulster Bank is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which get more in advance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During our journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan responded to Ross McEwan’s questions.
“The RBS mark stops being our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now becoming a much more banking brand.”
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand as well as the RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we are focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations, preparing a profile of individual sports sponsoring brands.
“It’s time for us to move to the brand bank because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers,” said the Executive Director.
Three years ago it would be very cynic if we said we would become a great bank for customers and those brands.
But along with the way we focused on the needs of customers, not our own, I think there are many changes.
We can recall these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Newmarket on the Predilection horse led to the 3000th winning goal
The detectors scattered champagne after a double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Frankie Dettori won the 3,000th victory in the UK in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this militant by his second victory at his local track - on the Predilection horse trained by John Gosden.
Fifty-year-old Italy is the sixth footballer who achieved such a result in equal achievements.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, Dettori, who had previously won on the horse of Ghayyar, said, "It's weird."
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I'm extremely happy that this happened in Newmarket because I just hit here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
It happened to me and I am very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when brings Predilection after victory
Two footballers achieved in obstacle contacts - the Richard Johnson football champion and the 20-time retirement champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his career led more than 4,300 winners to the goal.
Lester Piggott, Derby's nine-time winner, 4,493 career winner
Frankie is one of the best modern footballers, and it is not surprising that he reached a milestone that only a few riders had reached before.
It’s stylish and powerful, but it’s just his tactic figure that distinguishes him from the other riders seriously.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't just ride for the weekends and great achievements, he would have already 6,000 winner!
However, the truth is that Frankie runs the winner in the UK for a large part of his 30-year-old career, and that's really something.
It's a live nature, which is good for British sports, but more importantly, it's an incredible basketball.
Frankie Dettori celebrated its success with its famous flying jump
From the flying finishes to the flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been an ambassador of the British equivalent achievements for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain road.
An unprecedented number of winners of large races, including his famous “great seven” in Ascoth, survived but also the aircraft accident and had a ban on the start due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month start ban, but proved incredible internal force and all the suspects returned in the best form.
And maybe that's not the last time - Dettori has already announced that he would like to continue the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin releases President Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the office of the president.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest collaborators for many years.
The thirty-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin statement stated that Putin “released Ivanov from his service to head of the Russian presidential office,” but there was no reason.
It is replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s representative since 2012.
He was a 40-year-old former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he was later the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
In appointing Putin, he said, “Thank you for your confidence.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to promote your activities of the Head of State in the sense of drafting laws and to check the extent to which your instructions are met.
Putin said on Friday, the Russian television station said Ivanov asked him to get rid of the post and recommended that he replaced Vajno.
Will he convince the smile?
This step was completely mysticized by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Putin's closest co-workers for a long time and as Putin worked for the KGB.
As president, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcasted state television, the two men announced that he was leaving the office's chairman on his own request.
But the smile in the cameras convinced only a few people - mostly now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
Nobody knows that yet.
But the official allegation that the man, once considered to be a possible president, wished to lead Russia’s ecological policy at once, met with a great disobedience.
The Kremlin page cites comments to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview that this very challenging post could even be said to me, a problem post, to trust for four years.
Looks like I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov posted in December 2011.
He was formerly appointed Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Defense.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin led the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanova one of his five closest co-workers.
His time was even speculated that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor to the state after his second election period, as the third period would be anti-constitutional for Putin.
However, this post was taken by another close partner of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister only three and a half years later before he returned to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the series The Ideas of Criminals, was released after kidnapping the director
Gibson joined last month in Los Angeles in a physical exchange of views on the scene.
The television stations ABC and CBS that produce the series have announced their release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised Thursday before his release.
There were creative differences in the scene and disagreements.
“I’m sorry that it happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS television stations, the details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI's agent team a bit later.
The 40-year-old actress, celebrated by the main role in sitcom Dharma and Greg, acted in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and in the last twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them," Gibson said in a statement.
I hope I'll be in it until the end, but it's not possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, great fans in which this show could hope for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on September 28.
In Banff, a mysterious landing in the fish garden
A man from Banff asked for help to identify fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sandy holes that left the water smell there.
Bain, who lives approximately 500 meters away from the sea, published a short film on the Periscope channel in the assumption that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got from his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects to Fife
The project for £1.35 billion will be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern surface with Queensferry Crossing and viadukt - the bridge is now connected to Fife.
Therefore, the first of four closures between the "wizard windows", which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
A part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 conveyors.
The project for £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge as an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the surface of the bridge was a delicate operation that required exceptional accuracy.
Over 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, the concrete for the final part of the plateau is now deployed in Rosyth, so the whole plateau is ready to lift the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of ground construction.
After installing the last part of the road plate and its connection to the extending North Tower, we then had to close the last bridge on the northern side - towards the fortress.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 mm southward.
This was a massive and very delicate operation at the same time.
Massive because Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was required to draw it with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happily that they are alive"
Three men are "happily that they're alive" after the water was poured out from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The rescue boat station Moelfre RNLI announced fears on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in the Moelfre bay.
All three men tried to swim safely while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boats circling close to them and we thought it was the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones, the rescue ship's headquarters.
"Fortunately, the strong wind removed it from them before we left," he added.
Two men rescued a local fishing boat, the third man at the age of 60 was found out without a rescue dress, exhausted as the fighting was held.
They were all transferred to the coastal rescue boat and transferred back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and completely injured.
The engine of the boat had a chain for emergency disabled, but somehow it was disconnected from the person the boat was driving when a shift occurred.
Someone upstairs had a protective hand.
The judge refuses to deal with the case for Tluchor's wife.
Peter Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to the allegation, had to get from the Prime Minister of the Necessity and his former directors of the Cabinet of Jany Nagy’s political traffic, i.e. a lucrative post for political resignation.
In 2012 it was the approval of the tax package.
Snajdr, Fuks and Tluchor allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state firms.
Therefore, they also faced suspicions for pay and ended the month in prison.
However, according to the court, the compensation was expected to be totally 2 million crowns.
The thick man is now in the case as a witness, and this is after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and solves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, she wants to be careful by Judge Helena Král (he addresses criminal matters - knowing red.) and avoids possible objections.
The case is likely to take care of another Prague court district.
At the same time, the king has twice released the guilt of Jan Ne tempo, before Nagy.
It was the alleged abuse of military evidence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nečase Radka.
In this case, Tluchor did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives before the court.
I’m afraid that nothing could be judged at all, he noticed for the newspaper.
"It's good for me," he added.
In the case of political trafficking, Roman Boček is also accused, a former official.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, any objection would have a chance to succeed.
The Court of Procedure for Prague 1 was accused on 13 June by former Cabinet chiefs of Prime Minister Petra Nečase Jany Nagy (today Nečase) and other accused of abuses of military reporting.
The picture comes to court with his husband.
Tluchořa had to deal with the statements about Peroutk.
For example, the wife of the exposlable should judge President Milosh Zeman’s statements on the Democratic presenting journalist Ferdinand Peroutkovi.
Zeman said he had sympathy with Adolphe Hitler.
One of the schools is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed on the airplane of the Allied Forces.
She fled to Syria, along with her two equally old friends, in February from London’s Gatwick Airport.
The British Interior Ministry did not comment on her death.
Young Londoners who fled from home were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, for their other former co-worker at Bethnal Green Academy in London.
Last year, the case drew a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British security components estimate that approximately 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria, of which approximately 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
The work of dreams for a hundred thousand wages.
Great paid work you don’t even need a college.
That's how I look at the first glance of work.
Often on the other one.
For the benefit is not only extremely high wage for Czech ratios (in Prague you make up to £180,000 in IT work), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to statistics of the Grafton’s staff, it is among the programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
Hence, he does not take care of candidates for a job, but his job for candidates, comments Jitka Součkova, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
The university is not a need.
Higher education is not a need for children.
Higher education means a good foundation and is a general indicator of the intelligence and educationality of the candidate, but often does not have a lot of common knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once graduated university will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He earns the most in Prague.
The wages of the bowls are moving everywhere high above the Republican average.
Most of the money will come in Prague and Brno, but in the regions it’s no longer such a hitparade.
“The weather conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,” Kubačka confirms.
The highest salary will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno, you can reach 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, pay is lower, but not less than £80,000.
IT project managers are also required.
At the start, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the work office, the teachers do not apply.
If companies are transferring and paying over a professional from another company, they would like to pay for a graduate.
They can raise it according to their own.
Without language, they will not be covered.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but it is necessary for teachers to be at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet a number of cases in which companies are looking particularly for a professionally trained and experienced person and only satisfy the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support employee controls more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because it is able to serve more customers from different countries, Kubačka said.
Joy in Google, there's a paradise.
Just quietly envying Czech employees in Google.
Of course, it is a flexible working time for them, the possibility of working from home or various shortened times, not only for mothers.
“The company gives newborn fathers a four-week vacation after the birth of a child,” says Martin Jonek, Google spokeswoman.
Heating also provides health care for employees and family, food, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn is green and doesn’t matter what the new one wants to learn.
But this does not end the benefits.
Such a free fridge is certainly not to be purchased.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, in all offices there are so-called micro-cookies, where people always find a healthy sweat, the speaker reveals.
And so nothing has to get out, so what's not sleeping, it's put into the boxes that employees can take home evening.
What is the reason for these Czech conditions of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, development or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesman said.
The United Nations criticized Bulgaria for the crime of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is making serious concern about the lack of international law in Bulgaria," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly concerned to be witnessing how important and influential public personalities express public support for criminal armed fighters that organize refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go to Bulgaria are automatically arrested in an irregular manner," Zeid said.
And what is even worse - they are often punished and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite that, under international law, everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria arrested 14,000 migrants this year, last year 21,000 during the same period.
Pokémon Go - honba for health and happiness that will pay
It’s fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Many people have complained over the last decade that teenagers and children no longer play out and prefer to spend free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go leads people from the couchs and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally frozen on TV, later on video games and the latest on smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I’m talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 90s (a later drawing series, gaming cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, this new game was introduced in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then delayed due to the enormous interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, smart phone players go out searching Pokémons that are tracking using GPS, and when they find them, they can "photo" them (over screenshot on the phone) or "capture them".
Mania welcomed the generation that played the game at the younger age, bringing her out of the seats and women looking for Pokémony.
In the United States, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that a “average” person takes every day.
The app Cardiogram for smart watches from Appla, which watches 35,000 users, recently reported to Washington Post that in two days from the launch of the game, the number of followers who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 per cent.
The company does not have any information about who plays Pokémon Go - see only rough data about levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seek to find people 30, "take up from the cave" and "be active every day" fell on an unborn soil, because most of the messages aimed at public health are boring and intended for people who don't look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity involves weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t specify here.
But the beauty of the Pokémon Go game is that people go out and do something that is fun.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air, and sunlight, and fun.
Some people even get new friends when hunting for pokémons.
Of course, such boring patrons are found who are looking for any suggestions to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, how?
It's a diarrhoea.
In their time apps for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to track our activity, but they did not give us any reason to do something like this in this game.
The news starts, and interest in it begins to fall in a certain moment.
However, thanks to Pokémon’s success, additional games will appear that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people hunt for activity, health and better shape.

Simone Biles gained gold in women's multi-war gym
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort to bet.
At the simple ones, they were all overwhelmed.
Excellent in everything.
Finally, the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnastics went on a straight path after the title in multi-war, and others overcame the full lines under the Olympic reflectors.
The total score of 62,198 has clearly confirmed its rise in front of the silver medallist and member of the “Finalist Five” team of Ali Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliyu Mustafin.
Simone Biles (U.S.) on Thursday during his performance on the betting in the final of multiple individuals at the sports gym at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Riu de Janeiru, Brazil.
Billes became the fourth American in the series who won a multiplayer, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation for the best gymnastics of her generation and perhaps even the best of all.
When her overall final evaluation on the table and her long journey to that moment ended, she appeared in tears on her face.
This success ranks it in the same league of unique athletes of their time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes has dominated her sport for the last three years, won 15 medals at the world championships, including 10 gold. Her fascinating compositions are a mix of ambitions and accuracy, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton named her “the best gymnastics she ever saw.”
The last exam was waiting for her in Brazil, not just between Biles and the rest of the race, but between herself and the burden of too big expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (U.S.), and Aly Raisman are celebrated after the winner of gold and silver medals in the female multicolor final of individuals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the Brazilian Riu de Janeiru on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was a shouting at the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Marthy Karolyi.
Biles continues to say that she never looked forward during her long journey to the top, but that’s not so true.
Part of her composition in simple - the one that contains for her typical triple salto with double turn - is seated into Latin music, which would just go home, to streets outside the Olympic Arena in Riu.
That's not an accident.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a ballot and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym where Boorman trained and gained power.
The multi-war competition hasn't lost since the summer of 2013 - it's a trace of victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took short lead thanks to two rounds, it was just illusion.
Cladina and simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points per deposit - and finished with 15,933 points in free.
Raisman was gentle when they waited for the final scores - just formality - and around the shadows of red, white and blue, Biles appeared tears when the desires that she once entered in the journal were fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was so slightly paid for the Olympics four years ago, when it was divided into the third console with Mustafin, but then bronze due to a sum of the three best compositions.
This time, a twenty-year-old captain of a team that Americans call a grandmother was quite ahead.
After her simple, she sent a damn air kiss, filled with a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete put on Twitter this week, where it became a total hit, has a completely new significance:
Police: Three victims in case of a serial killer shot in listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most important attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot when they were sitting in the car, they talked and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot on 12 June in a car parked on the arrival path.
The report states that the armed man was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from the hand gun and then fled in another vehicle.
Police say they are not worth a triple murder thief because the attacker did not take the wallet or the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had no connection with some of the previous four attacks.
In two main Spanish neighborhoods, nine attacks occurred within four months that killed seven people and two others injured.
"It's happening in the villa area in front of the house," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of the CBS station.
Police believe that the suspect used several cars, including the brown Nissan from the late 1990s, the black BMW from the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she was later injured.
Liner (31) and Ellis Maleah's daughter died on site.
The police witnesses said it was not unusual that women were sitting in a parked car and listening to music.
Police have also published a police report on the shooting, which has become an empty shipment just half an hour before a three-time murder, and the police believe that she was the source of the serial killer.
The investigators found the containers and the remains of the balls in the seat and under the motor cap were composed of the ball.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephalia: "His condition improves"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of his age, loves singing, toys, and of course also his mother.
But unlike his layers, he suffers from microcephalia, which is a consequence of genetic disorders that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
What isn’t true – of course you’re ready for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent found out that Edmund may never know her and may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested it to be placed in the constitution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people wouldn’t do this anymore today,” explains Picciut.
Edmund is walking with the help of a walker.
And he sat there for three years, not seeing, neither did he eat nor drink.
Some borders are slowly filled.
He walks with help and rides on the wheel.
She also likes to play with her two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents a sign word with which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
“We learn him a sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common character speech - he says Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephalia may result from a number of different conditions: genetics, such as Edmunda, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as burners or Zika.
Symptoms and predictions can vary substantially.
It’s too early to tell us what the Zika virus will have on infected lives.
Picciut reminds the emotional tax chosen by the uncertain future.
I’m constantly asking, “What’s going on?”
What's going on?
And it's still not sure.
In fact, I never wondered what a total prediction is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me it at all.
Picciut, however, has an encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rain and flood demand rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and massive floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has announced that after extreme liaison, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in the south of Mississippi are out of its coasts and are threatening extensive floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokeswoman of the Governor’s National Security and Preparation for Crisis, said they received requests for a vehicle to drive in water, boats and sand pillows.
Steele said that only Tangipaho's district asked for ten thousand pouches of sand.
Flood guards will remain working in most South Louisianas on Saturday.
In a statement, the meteorological service stated that the sea could be more than 8 to 13 centimeters.
In South Alabama, the flood guard was prepared on Friday, when rain continued in the area of Mobile.
The Comite at Baton Rouge and the Amite at Denham Springs will be culminated for the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in the Baton Rouge districts.
He added that the floods in the Ascension district are at risk, when these diluted flows will only slowly deploy into the lake of Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, somewhat south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level at local time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
The rescue officers are still taking people out of the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson County in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his unownered son, were among the rescued at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, normally more than 120 meters away from his home, rose rapidly over the night.
He said he was warned by his other unownered son who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water approached,” Hansford said.
We had it until the passport.
According to his wife, it is the highest level ever experienced in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers rescued all three giant military-style trucks and transferred them to the Haiti station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of the rainfalls, the floods “speak quickly” and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been strongly crushed since Wednesday.
The authorities stated that rainfall and paid roads have requested the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
WWL station CBS branch announced that 200 homes were flooded according to Tangipaho's ageing house.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which are both flooded now.
The old town of Robby Miller said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets that high water captured.
In the village of Amite and in Hammond, there was an evacuation for those who had been evacuated.
“They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall,” he said.
In Tangipahoa County, Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and local residents were able to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
“The last big flood we had here in March,” Lacy Landrum said.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, head of crisis in Harrison County, Mississippi, said a persistent rain on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a couple of houses had been announced on Thursday, but none of them had been revealed in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in several places where I have never seen it before," Townson said, "and she's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot as resolved" survived a shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia and this week is the second shot for a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Parents say that the boy suffered several shooting injuries, including weaknesses, legs, legs and stomach, but when transporting to the hospital he was conscious.
"It was very powerful, his small body was shot like it was done," said his grandmother's station, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe that.
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital and has been undergoing several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should be healed.
He had to enter the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were fired: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-olds is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, another two victims are in a stabilized state.
According to the station, the child was shot on the front seat of the vehicle along with a ninety-nine-year-old man in a critical state.
Two more victims weren't in the car and the police investigated whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers at CBS Philadelphia said there was probably a shooting among several armed men.
There were found containers of a type of attack weapon belonging to various attack weapons.
I think it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were trails on the street on both sides of the walker.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved here," Philadelphian police officer Anthony Ginaldi said.
There were also several homes and vehicles in the area.
No one was arrested and the police suspected to investigate videos from cameras.
Another six-year-old child, the girl, this time, was shot in a blatant shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine a female gym team for the Olympics this year, for a few reasons.
First, I have been on every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gyms in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who inspired so many young color girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
Gymnastic number one in the last four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second round last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals was surprised to become a champion of the Olympics and America was playing.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of the three-time world winner Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who presented unexpected but master’s gym figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American who gained gold in the women's multi-colored individuals.
And the team member of Aly Raisman got silver.
We are witnesses of the sports top, but in the hours of gymnastics in the country it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie went to the Olympic team on the same way as Aly and Madison.
They are "final five" because the team of gymnastics for the next Olympics will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi trained.
The fact, however, is that gymnastics is a financially challenging sport and gyms train mainly in private gym clubs, which keep parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, decors, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their believers and families). And so far, that’s not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in wealthy areas in the suburbs that can promote activities.
In these clubs, gyms have all training and for families of gyms and gyms is a cost-effective and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles’ coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez’ coach, both trained athletes at the time they started gym.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to communities with countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the gym Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations where we offer free or low-cost gym in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (particularly Black and Spanish) and trained national and international championships.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gym to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind commitment.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and at work.
This team will inspire us to send thousands of young girls who want to do a gym, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
I thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison, for showing "girl power" and winning the Olympic gold teams, and thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origin to come on their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s proposal rejected, young doctors are ready to join other stakes.
The ministers hoped that after the negotiated contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be a cessation of an agreement on changes, but 58 per cent of the 37 000 young doctors who participated in the election refused the agreement.
Hunt revealed in July plans to force the contract with the NHS being in “nobody’s land” and another delay would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Youth Doctors, said in a statement yesterday: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore fair treatment with all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors pass under a new contract, it is necessary to achieve progress and time takes place.
The BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with the unwilling involvement of Dr. and often with the alarming silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt has to act now, press on force and solve the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last round at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were delayed, as nurses and specialists were invited to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the negotiated contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) will be concluded disagreements on changes.
BMA wants higher salaries for the weekend work for 45,000 young doctors who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the president of the NHS employers, called for young doctors not to enter any stake.
Mortimer said, “The event will be achieved only by little or nothing, but pressure will surrender on so heavy teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disturbance for patients careful staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have negotiated with the council of young doctors and together with the Ministry of Health and others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employees hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as difficulty, flexibility in schools, additional training for those returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study liberation, and difference in gender-based payouts - was the proof of how to deal with the Ministry of Health, and how to work seriously.
The drug for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Offices recommend that more patients take it for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor's blood clotting drug reduces the risk of a stroke again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered for 12 months after an infarction to reduce the risk of a stroke or other stroke.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and one-quarter of them will suffer from a further stroke or heart attack.
Infarction and swelling are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a associated layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is distracted, there may be blood clots, blocking the access of the blood to the heart and a heart attack.
If the stroke is released, the blood flow can continue, block blood supply into the brain and cause a brain stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another stroke.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk of a less likely crash.
In the proposal for a NICE Directive, which has been published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg of aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had an infarction and who are affected by another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
It has been proven that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and stroke in people who have already suffered from a heart attack.
We are pleased that we can extend treatment options with Ticagrelor’s pre-recommendation, which are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - mainly on the risk of bleeding - over three years is limited, the design of treatment over this period is not recommended.
Computing culture begins to bloom fraud in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets City Old Town Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year due to corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political correction has led to the overview of the spreading fraud in Muslim communities, the government report reports today.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles criticizes police, electoral inspectors and councillors for ignoring the abuse of voters due to “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption intervention, said that fearing voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should make cordons and threatened voters against election rooms.
He advised voters to take the identity document with them and to demonstrate who they are in the elections.
Nowadays, the voters are sufficient to specify their name and address.
The report further suggests wearing an unleashable ink on the fingers of the person when it comes to voting to prevent the vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, Pickles says.
Requests the press to have greater access to documents from the meetings and to decisions taken by informal committees or group work.
"It is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also protecting the local government against the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that leads to it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal in the Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post after being accused of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “invaded” the religious sense of his Muslim community and silenced his criticisms by accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, “he made his campaign to be the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or as a result of the stealing of identity, when a person votes and releases someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed special concern about fraud in the correspondence vote - on which it is alleged that the older members of the Muslim community during it developed pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documentation
In his report, "evidence has been presented to the vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, has been pushed to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh."
“There was anxiety that... state institutions were entangled before such behaviour because of the “political correct” oversensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean the system, including to prohibit political activists from manipulating correspondence voices and thus preventing “voice extraction.”
Theresa May's report now assessed also requests more detailed checks on registrations to prevent the use of immigration fraud and dosage fraud lists.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to submit an identity document before voting.
Using an unleashable ink on people's fingers in voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementing systematic nationality checks to ensure that they can be elected.
Restriction of requests for automatic correspondence for a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists to manipulate with deferred correspondence voices and voters.
To give the police permission to create around the election rooms of the Cordone.
Amendment of laws to make it easier to strike people developing illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Forbid photographs in the election rooms.
Require only Englishmen (except Wales) to work in election rooms.
Strengthening training and ensuring that employees comply with the rule that voters enter the electoral cabinets individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it's "surprising" that no charges of crime were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for Lithuania corruption and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons over the framework of reasonable doubts - in the power of proof of a crime.
It also criticizes the inconsistent “check-up field control” in the departments for the registration of voters at the council.
Sir Eric said: “The last judgment of the court in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to the colleagues of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbant and hidden spread of election fraud and the state of refusal by some authorities threaten this reputation.
Cyclistic duplication of Duchess Kate and other duplicates of known characters at the Riu Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Riu Olympics have been crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which is apparently similar to the Duke of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympics is not far away the only athlete seeking gold this year, which can be praised by its own twin from a number of well-known characters - at least not according to social networks.
For the celebration of the Olympics in Riu and all the famous characters that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL column for women has prepared a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to holywood celebrities.
As a hunter: A member of the U.S. team of luxury shooters Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio from a little bit
In addition to the twin Kate on the bicycle road, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain luxury shooter could be a twin star Leonardo DiCapria.
Brady Ellison, a team of U.S. luxury shooters, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared to be like a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he heard of his similarity with Leo from his little ones.
“They don’t see any big similarity, except the cars,” Brady told Huffington Post.
“It’s a freak and looks good, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will certainly be highlighted more this year: the obvious image between the British jump to the distance Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin with her big, expressive eyes was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Glorie Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for change: User thinks Nathan is a "athletic version" actress from the film Start (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadala and actor Joshe Hartnett, who have similarly thick wings and lips.
The Russian silver bath Yulia Efimovo is not only proud of the same eating skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord has. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team fans say it looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levit."
Females: Hope Solo (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased to notice similarities as well.
Theory on the waves: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed satisfaction in the fact that “the remainder of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical.”
Football star Hope Solo and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among the other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal at Gabby Douglas's gym, who is proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which would copy the smile of Gabrielle, Bray Union's film star.
CBC's commentator of the Olympics asks for excuse for the Chinese swimsuit saying it "exploded"
The viewers of Wednesday's live streaming from the Olympics at CBC station won the fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance break by Byron MacDonaldem. The swim ended up at the fourth place of the women's race at 4x200 m free-style stafets
Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of her commentators said a fourteen-year-old Chinese swimman was “smart as a smell” and “exploding.”
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was disabled when at the end of the women's 4x200-meter-free style staffed at the end of the final.
MacDonald, who had to bring to the CBC commentator’s team “revival,” among other things, said: “The fourteen-year-old from China abandoned it, you fools.”
Exaggerated excitement, it swore like a smell, it exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimman Ai Yanhan (14) floated the second race staff at 1:57.79 - thus 1,61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to reach China.
Visitors in Canada began to quickly call online and were frightened by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “Have the CBC voter announced that a 14-year-old swimmer from China “has exploded”????”
The idiot didn't notice that he was still on the radio."
Ai Yanhan from China, at the 4x200-meter free-style female staff race final, was described as: “This 14-year-old from China abandoned it, you stupid.”
Byron MacDonald’s critics on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was, they did not stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we are a band of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologised for MacDonald’s live comment and said, “We apologize for the comment on the performance of a swim that escaped to the broadcast.”
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC has finally apologised for more than 90 times people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russel had to apologize for the name of MacDonalda
CBC then copied and filed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about MacDonald’s comments
The station also promptly apologized and published a statement.
Honestly, she regrets that the words were shouted, she shouldn't get into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our audiences in broadcasting and to those watching us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's commentary concerns the performance of the bathing, not the bathing alone.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
Byron MacDonald apologised for live broadcasting on Thursday afternoon and tried to explain his note by claiming that he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I introduced last night after women's stafe," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station.
“I was thinking about swimming performance, not the person swimming as such.”
“There is no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect and that is very sorry for me.”
Customers in Primark worsened by a woman who unshamedly tried the underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman tried to try the pants in the midst of Primark, she wasn't sure to look at.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size would fall, she pulled out the pants and brought them back to the ring.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of shoes at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Flokestone.
Primark shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before she returned to the regal
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at a time, said that the mysterious woman, after exploring the underwear, “was dressed again and left the store without buying anything.”
He said, "People could not believe in their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the shop, took out of the straw of a shirt, dressed her own shirts and shirts and put them on her.
"He didn't attempt to find any discreet place - just standing there, hanging like potatoes."
"Everyone just watched his pants again, and obviously she didn't like it because she returned to the ring."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, she dressed and left again.
"It seemed to her that she didn't care who looked at her or that she would think of the man who needed to buy a shirt that she tried."
Mrs. Davidson, 33-year-old, who lives in Kent, said: "It's an idea that someone takes a shoe that someone else had on it and no one cleans it. That's crazy."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "When she left, I collected things that she obviously tried to remove them from the sale - which is also the only right thing."
“I would have an idea that I would bring a new pants to my house and find out that there was another woman on her, dressed them up, and they weren’t washed out.”
Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that happened in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to Defend Against Gun Attack With Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com could be something safer for you.
We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, the extremely prominent New York Krav Magy Federation to find out how to deal with armed bullets at a nearby distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain overweight over the violent, whether it's approaching you from the front or back.
If Mizrachi comes closer to you, then the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and “have a free track of shooting.”
Then you will catch the weapon between your predecessor and your shoulder just before you throw it into your face with a free spot.
Then he follows the knees into the weaknesses, and while the attacker climbs in the pain, you cut off his gun from his hand, hit his head in his face, and you start to stop, while you keep the gun targeted on him.
If an armed man approaches you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, pick up the weapon and pull it out so that the kidney can't shoot.
At the same time, put the force in the weapon and hit the attacker in the breast, then pull the weapon out of its swallowing and start down, still calm on it.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video where you can see how Mizrachi does.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the collapse - unless you are a very extreme Krav Maga - is to issue all cash.
Traveler Ian Wright has announced the most popular places in Europe in a travel guide
The British traveller decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a daunting reflection - by eliminating the most delicate and delicious places in Europe.
Moderator and author of travel papers Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, for the proof of the strength of his immune system, he shook the euro banknote in his own language, the Piccadilly Circus clips, the clips on the toilet in the train and the Russian public phone.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us all what he was going to do.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded, however brought interesting results.
The idea of grinding the buffer button on the train that thousands of other people have used may seem totally foolish, however, for example, in the kitchen is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright talked to physicians and health professionals throughout his journey across Europe about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing of what he had left in his mouth left nothing worse than taste.
Ian Wright celebrated testing his intestinal resistance on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public rifles at the train stations to the rifles
In the film he recorded about it, he says, “I haven’t cared about my health since childhood, and I have made everything I could in my mouth, from the hills to the eating of herbs and swallowed water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple screw, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but olizant refused after his luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio recorded a traveller's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the nakedest thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing more dirty than this exists!
I'm not going to melt anything because it's unpleasant here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
Mr. Wright has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior Vice-President of Valio for Food, Juice and New Categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would be watching the occupation, while at the same time, would allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We have invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "be calling John."
It is said that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking only about products, we wanted to put them into broader connections - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he looked at something I wanted for him - such as the delicious Russian bathroom that appears in the film."
To look at some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult again.
“I’m glad we’ve made some of those dirty things.”
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that 84% of respondents combined milk acid bacteria with the health of the stomach and intestines, and 58% of respondents said at least occasionally consume products containing added milk acid bacteria.
The family socially needed before moving destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwallu
The family of socially needed had left a £50,000 injury on its home after being charged with the terrorism of its neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were moved from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent displacement from the house, the officials of the housing group were shocked when they found that the property was in an emergency.
In the walls were holes, the floor was covered, waste were warned everywhere on the floor and walls were counted.
The family has already moved and is thought to live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, Head of Home Affairs at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried if she was going to rescue the house.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
It is necessary to consider a number of circumstances, because this property is likely to come into consciousness as a “not so beautiful part” of Cornwal.
This family is unusually known and their names are unusually known.
The couple has three sons who sometimes lived in the house, and the police said that the horror of the family was involved in street battles using baseball fires, intimidating the surrounding population, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, disputes and sorrows.
Skeldon (47), whose name was indicated in the rental contract, was punished for anti-social behaviour in June.
In several rooms in a house that may be broken down, waste was found.
In the house, from where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor cover was dried.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, as a pearl, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing moved her and her partner with violence from home this week after receiving an additional 11-week deadline to voluntarily move.
The neighbours with whom the retreat took place welcomed their lives as a living hell.
They said to her, “Don’t talk to anyone about this name. ”
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always this way.
How many times we've seen the police here, we can't count on it at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, supervisor of Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood, said that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly invited to the house.
Waste and old toys flooded in the growing part of the municipal house
He adds: “It is a shame that the renter has failed to take responsibility for his own behaviour and for his family’s behaviour. Moving is always the last step Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complicated case because their behaviour was extreme and their actions according to the Witness had to fear her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall and the local community members who boldly informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbours and at the same time bring a message that we will not tolerate uncommon behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all the three sons of the rent, who lived in the house in different times, had been around 20 years.
Polluted mattress, which stayed on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving
Workers will now have to remove the collections of waste that have remained swallowed around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the house of the razia and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received a penalty when she was found guilty of holding B-class drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to move rentals who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow from the Dean and Cornwal police said the move was a clear message to other tenant who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can be treated without penalty and to those who want to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Deno and Cornwal will never tolerate criminal and non-community behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened after a low flight of a military press plane over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunlight in the Portuguese Aveiro were frightened of death
P-3C Orion’s Portuguese Military Aircraft Flights Unexpectedly Low
Military Air Force said it was an exercise flight, and it continued that there was no threat to safety.
At the moment when the low-flying press jumped over the filled beach, the feared tourists enjoyed panic.
On dramatic pictures, it is seen how the military aircraft reaches nearly a distance from sunset to the sandy beach in the city of Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The tourists began to get rid of after the noise of the engines of the press aircraft was decayed without seeing what was going on from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the several recreators who published videos of a dramatic flying on social networks, said: "The plane has been flying twice very low and it seemed to be a bit down at once."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I've been surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were frightened when a low-flight plane appeared from the dark
The Portuguese military today announced that the P-3C Orion pilot was on an exercise plane to identify fishing vessels at the coast and had to be carried low because it was the only way to check the vessel.
The airplane is claimed to fly something less than usual because of the bad visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the airplane remains on the fact that human safety has not been threatened.
Forest fires destroyed a portion of Portugal this summer and demanded four deaths on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced that the pilot had to fly low due to dense smoke and smoke from the fires that prevented him from flying
The aircraft was on an exercise flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Commercial Inspection (CHI) found this in the second quarter of the inspections.
The funeral services do not often inform the remainder of their prices or issue a written confirmation of receipt of an order.
For this, it imposed 41 fines at a total of 73,000 crowns.
It was reported by her spokeswoman Jiří Fröhlich today.
Inspectors found doubts at 47 out of 95 checks.
In addition to not being informed of prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at a price other than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially unverified measurement.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 krones.
This applies to the packaging of urnes, candles and laces which were not properly labeled by the mandatory information.
“Because there is still a violation of the law in this specific service area, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,” Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultan, one of three British school students who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said the family had learned about her death in Syrian Rakka a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian air strike in Rakka, which is a group's basement in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just at the time she was preparing to escape from the war of a rebellious country and to return to Britain.
“Man wants to believe that the only good thing for all of that thing – such as a message and warning for others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone – is that he betrays people from making decisions,” he said.
Sultan and two other students from the eastern part of London arrived in February 2015 on the plane to Turkey and then on the bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family found out that she had been married to a fighter in Syria, and in a few months she had been married.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The Senate leader for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton appoints judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in case of his election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama would appoint him in March.
The leader of the Senate majority, Mitch McConnel, says that a person who replaces the deceased judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
Reid said on Thursday that Clinton would choose Garland “with a certain degree of confidentiality.”
Reid's spokeswoman later said he didn't talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland would nominee, and that he was only speculating.
He rated Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "rozhou the ship" by the choice of someone else.
Garland is president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are "services" and "poscock" Republican candidates for Donald Trump's presidential office.
He said Trump wouldn’t go to the office.
According to the magazine Treats, “women and men are naked” calendars
The Treats magazine works closely with photographer David Bellemeer to publish a 2017 calendar, inspired by the 70’s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing known personalities, NU Muses is trying to find the next generation of top models for its 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nakedness is different from Playboy from old school because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is also believed.
"We have to return to showing overtime and classical nakedness when women and men feel pleasant and are not allowed to be inspired by the photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where Does Vinyl Go: Who Really Buy Gramphonic Discs?
Vinyl loves loneliness of men in the middle age.
Before you decide to zahlt the comments section with pepper notes under the pseudonym "Not allOsameliMužiVest the Middle Ages, we submit that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of gramofon plates is associated not with the boome of millennials who want to buy the original property of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the medieval age.
Those who recently purchased vinyl album are most likely people aged between 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are less likely.
In fact, it’s not about collecting an enthusiastic fan – all this has an emotional dimension: elderly people who buy gramophones are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56 % versus 53 %) and are happy to be themselves (69 % versus 66 %).
But are YouG's results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television reporting, the camera would watch me putting out into the rude street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey dress and widely gestured. Then I would stop, lift up my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's look at it."
So let's look at it.
While So's heart is slowly losing its charm and magic - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, now are filled with hotels, restaurants and dishes, cooks and office needs - several fantastic specialized shops with gramofon tables have remained.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop playing for a while, and I'll stand close to the different men in these stores and try to figure out what their age and emotional disposition are.
Stuart (55 years), a Glasgow parent I watch from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three men of medieval age) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight men of medieval age, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill a few hours.
I wonder if it's the collector.
“I think it is,” he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All those recordings remove the walls of his living room - on the image up (I sent a photo by email, I didn't watch him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has thanks to the fact that they can allow it: they can now buy gramophones that they couldn’t allow when they were originally out, and they can buy again what they sold in their youth and didn’t even have a windshield.
“Much of what I buy is from the late 60s and the beginning of the 70s. These are things that I would have issued when I was 11 or 12 when I was too young and couldn’t get them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are probably introverts that they like themselves, and they add: “I don’t smoke and don’t even hurt too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers that he encounters are included in the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new flood of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramophone plates back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often rid of them from 1998 to 1999.
Customers who once sold their grammar discs and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their grammar discs back,” he said.
This could explain to the boom of lovers of gramophone boards of a certain age.
But what is the presumed emotional importance of the gramophone plates?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly aggravated by the system of non-contact payments.
Some fans of gramofon plates can feel zahlcene in the digital world and decide for the well-known environment of the packaging of gramofon plates, things that cause memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling out the limits or holding something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think that's the case with many people too.
It’s an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers,” a colleague from a group of gramofon boards says.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album earlier have not yet heard it.
According to the survey, 41% of the surveyed gramophones never use, while 7% of those who buy gramophones do not have gramophones.
At this point of reporting he was probably seriously worried about the browsing of the compilation bossa nova.
The aspect of the "trophey" and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42) noticed, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came and said, ‘I don’t have a gramofon yet, but I want to buy on Radiohead so that we can put it on the pocket,” he said.
The percentage of these is not big, but it is happening.
This is more about the product page than about music.
People are coming to us who say, "I don't have a GRAMOPHONE."
These are younger people, not older, adult puberty people who get into it.
Fopp, where nearly one whole floor is currently reserved with a gramofon board, has many more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are pairs of seventies, tourists who are taking pictures, puberty and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as shops were before - the speakers call the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthetic and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but it’s hard to estimate a thrilling mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks through a few minutes in Fopp and views various gramophone plates in the discount.
It's one of those who's looking at the expenses rather than spending hot.
According to his words, he doesn't make much, so he doesn't think he would collect gramophones.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that, but the gramophone plates have their magic... .. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ."
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that allegedly inspired a new generation of lovers of gramophone boards: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in a lot of girls in twisted jeans and watch a group of ten-year-old girls who are just climbing around the Polaroid cameras, and then my father and my daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
On the left is the staircase of which the wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mix of current and classical music, the basis of any average collection of grammar plates.
No one looks at them - perhaps just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be achieved.
It’s just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for another, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area where more time and money is likely than in other areas is also the one where the most is spent on the most luxurious goods on which vinyl is definitely.
But while I find that the results of YouGov appear to be accurate - so at least in graph plate stores, they do not consider a large number of vinyl collectors and lovers who actually exist in graph plate stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or offices.
It certainly doesn’t spend the Thursday morning by sweating after shops on the Berwick Street, browsing recordings, and avoiding a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator that hides behind the back of non-smokers of middle-aged men.
Grenoble is the longest-living offender - video reporting
According to scientists, the Groenlandia rabbit has the longest average life span of all the planet’s rotators.
Julius Nielsen, who is studying bulbs, says the recording shows a woman whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years and measuring five meters.
The French court refuses to break down trades in the Jungle Refugee Camp
The court in France rejected the order of Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the court meeting this week, the authorities in Calais said the state should have the opportunity to cancel a total of 72 provisional stores, where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy beverages, offer haircuts, in the provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for a few euros.
The prefecture office in Calais argued that the locations must be broken down because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they represent a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations at the court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free foods offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Conflict interim shops and restaurants often provide ground floors and free food to people in emergency.
The Lille court decided that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 interim trades, but said the opposition to the Calais prefect is "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, coffee shops and restaurants have a much greater role than merely feeding people who “live under extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that the demolics threatened was the cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, operated by a non-profit organization, offering 200 meals, hours of English and French, and asylum advice for hundreds of threatened minors without accompanying the camp.
The petition for the protection of the “child” cafe has signed more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closing of the cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of which were only eight years old.
The charitable organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp rise in the summer has increased to more than 9,000 - which is the most all-time to date.
You thought he was dead.
The end is shattered by the Volleyball Orchids.
"I have been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of summer preparations in full power.
What happened to you?
I had both pulmonary embolia, and that's because of heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the difficulty caused long flights to Asia?
I've been a bit bitch for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found anything to me.
Then the crash came up.
In the end, the vein is demolished, it will always hurt, especially when the weather is shaking or changing.
But nothing that would limit me, rather aesthetic thing.
You were worried about life?
He had.
Last year at the Summer Tournament in Woodennices I didn’t know I had an embolia, and I couldn’t move there anymore.
I've washed my blood tonight.
The doctors told me that it's something completely different, I've been completely fixed for five days.
I really thought in the Woods I was dead, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you compare it?
I guess I had to experience it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, I have to take care more when I fly somewhere.
But everything can be done with it.
Just when I wanted to go back to the preparation of Apbrami last year, there were still problems with the heart.
Now it's all right.
Since March I have been preparing for myself at home to be able to play again.
I swear, I'm physically better on it than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm looking forward to, the party looks good, most of the boys I know.
I'm curious about two other strangers who are coming.
I hope we're sitting humans to match it together.
Can you raise your mouth?
He had a reputation, but every season is different.
It was eight years ago, and the second ended.
There is a new team in the mouth, only a few players remain.
It was the last in extralization, so there's a big space to improve.
As we use it, it's on us.
We'll see the first wheels, who's going to be a cluster, we're probably not.
Is Brom a Success Guarantee?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot of it, he's going to think better than the last place.
But my arrival didn't agree with him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I was a great friend with one, and it was agreed that he would work here.
I'm not going to say the name.
Mr. Brom finally came, and I'm glad.
My great name, he was in good clubs, trained for many decades, is a former good player.
They'll move us upstairs.
What are you bringing?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to act, and I like to get an opportunity in a not so high-end team.
I've been two years in Probrama, but the mouth is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts at the bottom.
You mentioned strangers, in the mouth, Australian Boehm is already trained.
What's it like?
I know him in some circumstances, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And we have been playing there a couple of times, sometimes we sat together at night after matches, so we already know a friendship.
We defeated them 3:1, and immediately I poured it out at the beginning of the summer preparation in the mouth.
She's a Slovak girlfriend, she's a sympathy.
There are still Americans and Brazilian Ze.
Do you know anything about them?
With the American I wrote, it looks like a good boy, a Brazilian who knows how to learn English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I am a recorder, that is, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately figured out what it's like, I found on the internet how it plays, I saw some videos.
He's all right, the boy jumps, he's high.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, seeming to be a bitch, we'll go back to us.
How do you look forward to the recorder position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'll only be forty-four and I don't have a chance to change it.
I'd rather be in the center of the event, I'd rather be in the team than someone else's leadership.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I'd have to be like another recorder and devote it to full time. If something doesn't do full-time, it's worth it.
How many times have you been single?
A half-time in Probrama, when Kustova did not go as a captain, injured himself, then there were problems with the money, and he left.
Since then, we've been upstairs and I've been playing.
In Brno, I've changed the one and the twin.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and just chose the Prabram.
Budějovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of that embolie.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
The short position remains the Phelps domain.
"Being on the stages of winner again and hearing the hymn is sweet as always," laughed Fhelps, while again having eyes full of tears.
His bridegroom and his mother were again hanging in view, and Boomer’s son this time calmly fell asleep on his ears.
I'm going to have an amazing week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming race and in a few hours it'll be over, he said.
In the final after Phelps, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long position for two seconds.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last world championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance) Michael Phelps is the third athlete who managed the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race, Phelps and another American Ryan Lochte and Thiago Perreira were headed.
While the defenders of gold in the end of the fifty-year-olds planted to the tremendous finish, they broke out of the medal position.
The U.S. superhero will have at least one more chance to expand its unique medal collection in Riu.
Shortly after the celebration of the position, he put the race in the final of 100 meters.
The legend could not even shade by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the character double - after a hundred won in Riu and doubled the line.
In the final he left 37 sets of Australian swimman Mitchell Larkin behind him, the third ended by Russian Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the two, he has become a symbolic king in Riu.
Larkin was settled from his intentional throne, with the same double success at the last world championship.
He won the medal at the Olympics just now.
The Canadian Penny Oleksiac and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold.
For the sixteen-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second after silver from the stafet.
Swimming gold won OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration for others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports will become love for them and they will get to wherever I am, said Grandma Manuel.
Thirdly, she was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-meter motel race in Riu in the world record, and still has silver from the kraular two-piece.
The sixth end of Australian recorder Cate Campbell.
Japan Rie Kanet won the first Olympic medal in the seventy-seven years.
It has no precious metal or from the world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Riu was gained by Russia, Julija Jefimovo, who is faced with the hostility of viewers and competitors in spite of the start of games despite the doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimsuit.
The right to start in Riu was required for a special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the game.
They handled my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if someone else has another opinion, let him turn to the arbitration court, he added.
Hermann: disappointment, we could win.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs experienced a special day.
It was only about an hour before the match, who was going to go against.
They had to deal with tactic preparations.
And then, in a non-traditional time, the game started on a small curve number one.
The first set did not start well, then the rivals reached the mass, but at 19:19 they did not succeed.
In the second, they were clearly better and comparable, but the decisive tie-break did not go to them.
Mostly, the series of displayed services meant a loss of 10:15 and a tournament with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated the Russians," Hermann regretted.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I got the income I used to before.
We lost the set, which was key.
In the next set, we came to them with overview of the playground, another defense, and we pushed to the service.
In the tie-break, there were terriblely broken injections, we dressed on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
The beginning of the first set, we have escaped there.
We managed to download it, but we missed the bodies.
The second set was super and the third was the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five, we had a lot of flaws there.
It’s a bad thing because the Russians were playful.
How did you play in small castle number one?
Similar to in China in secondary palaces.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
It was an hour in the night, total silence, music wasn't playing, nothing.
It was a difference compared to the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was weird.
We started training for the game without knowing the counter-players so we couldn’t make a tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch) captured the tactics of almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers with tactics, so after this page we were quite well prepared.
Do you remember that you would ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: I guess not.
We played in half the eleventh, but not in twelve.
The Russian Birlovs block in front play-off at OH, Riu.
Beach ballots Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann at the play-off front at OH, Riu.
Was it uncomfortable?
By playing the last two matches in the group from ten, we had the regime moved earlier.
This was two hours more.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've been preparing the best we could.
We knew that it would be, but it's not quite typical and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the procedure from our group was our goal, it's okay on one side, okay.
We managed what we said.
But now I'm sad after the match.
I’ll sleep and I’ll only remember positively for the Olympic tournament from tomorrow.
The big brother is here, the first SIM is coming.
You can't touch her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a passport in Thailand who decide to apply SIM to some of the local operators when staying in Thailand.
Not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visa, for example, who work in Thailand or have been married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and Telecommunications Commission Takorn Tantasith reported that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sale plan for exclusively foreigners introduced the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
New measures allowing the monitoring of their positions shall be implemented by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of preservation of national security that will allow the criminal activity committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIM will also help to discover people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Within six months, sellers should also have a special SIM for foreigners on the side of the SIM dedicated exclusively to the Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function that will be permanently enabled for cards for persons without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thai SIM, because we can always easily track you," Tantasith added.
It is necessary to add that prepayments in Thailand are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity certificate.
On the other hand, a few years, one of the operators distributed free SIM launch to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand also considers ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
Even in these cases, SIM registration is mandatory, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures taken do not mean for foreigners an obligation to take place when entering the SIM country of the local operator.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in this case the Thai authorities will be short for them.
For the operators of the country, after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network, only know the relevant network information.
They know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so profound that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand begin to look at local SIMs.
The supervision of the movement of foreigners by foreigners living in Thailand legally took immediate criticism.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in relation to privacy, the system provided compares to the obligation of providing residence addresses in immigration documents.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need a court order.
Any misuse of the system will be threatened by undetermined punishment.
"If the service provider keeps track of the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While the specific number is currently recycled until the expiry of the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been registered on the network, the new number could be recycled after fifteen days in case Thailand is left.
The luxury apartment in new building in Vinohraden has a pool and a terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in the new building?
We were looking for an uncomfortable apartment where most of the property care existed by the administrator.
The condition was enough of parking spaces and elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not about problematic acoustics in old homes, problems with sowing floors, high energy demand and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is unable to offer.
You will find more interesting visits in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed by architect Lenka Langer and his colleague Kamilou Polák from Artiga’s studio.
Why did you just tell them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to everyone?
Co-operation with the architect would recommend to everyone if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the design of the interior itself: the designers have a substantially better idea of the variety of possible materials and are able to fit the interior properly on the basis of the customer’s wishes.
We and architect Lenka Langer have already worked in our mountain apartment, based on the personal recommendation of another customer, and since everything worked well, a clear choice was for us even in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vienna.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a large social-residential space with an adequate background for a four-member family welcomed as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to achieve intelligent household control.
And, of course, it was necessary to carbonate the quality of execution.
Have you left everything on professionals, or have you intervened in the final form of the interior?
All designs including technical drawings and samples of materials have been approved, however, the design has always taken up from the architects.
Initially, we decided what we expect from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the design, such as covers or pictures.
I think that our collection of Czech authors including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysuchela, Václava Spala, or Otto Gutfreunda architects have helped focus on our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and pearl wood was the idea of architectural as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, covers, textiles, art etc. We then checked together with visualization.
Have some complications occurred when you realized that you had to give up your original ideas, or on the contrary, to join the new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible for the first time to ascend to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned are actually shadows of the surrounding building.
At that time, we literally changed the arrangements overnight from the base.
On the kitchen line and on the covering of the curve wall was used the yellow.
In the interior, wooden surfaces are then dominated by complemented leathers, for example, by shaking dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes, or is there something you would like to have different today?
I think it's a modern air interior that meets its purpose.
We don't need any changes, most adjustments after moving took place at the level of shade and residence of the terrace.
Perhaps the only way to go is to the floor, when the oarwood is shown to us as too challenging in the home with the dog.
Word architect, Ing. arch. Lenka Langer and MgA. Kamila Hornych, author of execution.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make completely new arrangements and several additional adjustments within the building.
For the interior, it is an important element of placing light pipes into the ceiling of the hall and main toilets.
We got the daylight into the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the construction arrangements, which was very useful for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a barbecue.
Compared to France, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
They come from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, close to the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, so I got to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to withdraw from the country?
I started to feel like I'm breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere among people.
I realized that every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but it has worsened in recent times.
It’s interesting that you’re talking about negativeism.
This is how some people appreciate the Czech nature.
Believe me, you are not negative in comparison to French.
Some people may not see it when they come to France because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
There is a big theme for money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There is also a problem with the behaviour of people against Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour began to look at me through my fingers just because I am a Muslim.
As if I were a bad one.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I’ve been looking for a job anywhere else, and I’ve hit a freelancer at Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn’t know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me what happened in the Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years and I can't imagine I wouldn't live here.
Was that a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or injuries, but I feel like people are more free here.
That I can do anything, dress up anyway, and no one will judge me.
Someone in France still looks uncomfortable at you, for example, when you have special clothes and so on.
I started to look really free in Prague.
Those who are celebrated do not take care of such things as I think.
Where are you working now?
After I worked at Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then we and one more friend created a website on which people are offering and looking for shared housing.
We are currently only working in Prague, but we would like to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are Czech from half, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another specification of the Czechs is that it keeps the departure at first.
He won't leave anyone right away.
That's quite different from the place I grew up.
In the south, they all kiss their faces.
It's different here, but I understand that it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You said you weren't talking Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have a pretty simple thing in Prague, because I think everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by bringing everyone at least a bit of communicating in English, I don’t need to learn a language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you encountered some negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
No, basically not.
Maybe it’s also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience attacks me.
My leader, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and told me something in the sense: they are not French, but Africans.
That's what's going on with me.
But if someone has a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, they'd get me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen anywhere today.
I have not yet imagined that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur'an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you see it when terrorists are protecting your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel guilty and blame, even though I shouldn't feel it at all.
I'm trying to not watch the news about violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met on the square of Jiří from Popodbrad.
On Wednesday, the Czech Muslims and Christians protested against violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about it.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don't think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
There are a little more religious foundations than I, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I'm from France, so I've gone through other education, they may have learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of a woman.
How do you see it?
I don't seem to be subjected in any way.
It's the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It’s also related to the fact that you don’t have any coverage of your head.
For example, Higgins?
This is the main way I was educated.
My mother, for example, is a very basic Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but the cup does not wear.
She always taught me that faith is a very personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When you read the Qur’an, you should make your own opinion on these things.
So when I read in the Qur’an a passage that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the sight of others, I said to myself, “I’m not a Prophet’s woman, so why should I hide?”
On the other hand, I respect this, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where sheets are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yeah.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I have been thinking about Poland for a while, but in Prague it is great.
I can even imagine that I would raise my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for it.
The Czech Muslims, together with Christians, protested against violence.
Kozelska Fencl wind in Riu bore on the processes.
Friday's sea trips in Brazil's Riu de Janiero were issued by the Czech jacketer Veronice Kozelské Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to the tenth place in front of the final two walks.
This would ensure the participation in the final ride.
You collect packages as pokémons.
They want to compete with transporters.
Following the idea of taking advantage of the already planned journeys for broadcasting, the TV director Matej Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With an idea, life breathed into three applications with different geographical reach.
The National Transportation application was launched in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first than we focus more on abroad, says in an interview for iDNES.cz, a four-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer application work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and details of how large a package you can transport and how much you want.
Someone needs to be transferred again on that day.
When the route matches the delivery time, it gets worse and mutual notification comes to both.
At the moment, the chat will be opened, where the two will agree to the transmission.
How many people would you expect to register in order that each package always finds its own guesthouse?
I don’t know the ideal condition, I can’t estimate how many registered and how many roads are needed to be fully optimal and every offer matches the demand.
On the main stages it already works, and it is logically easier than possible on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and accuracy.
People still build confidence and find out that no one can escape with the package.
Didn't you have to deal with such a case yet?
How many users have the service two months after launch?
Currently, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who are creating paths.
We believe that this is a success and we believe that another will be wrapped up.
Isn’t it possible that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver something even the same day and for a price break.
With a large company, you will pay a few thousand for delivery within two hours.
You may pay a hundred or less, because that’s the way you’re already doing.
Should traditional carriers be worried about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has a huge potential, feeding over-the-country carriers here, as well as business chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what it is paying for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the box with a message that he has to take the shipment to the branch, not before that day after nine o'clock.
I needed the package for six hours at that time and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won’t hurt anyone and send out a signal to the competition, whatever it tries.
Marek Greger (41) and Matthew Liška (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matéj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses packages already planned to transport routes between the world metropolitans, mainly by plane.
In 2015, they launched a company processing project that created applications such as MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programme lasted three quarters of the year and the application was placed on the market in March 2016.
Transfer applications began to develop in December last year and were released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted to the Czech market.
The Messiah and Profi applications have been developed since January this year and have been made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The purpose was from the beginning to make all these applications that one day will join in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to upload the application and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
The shared economy has recently been a topic and this is the service of AirBnB or Uber.
Do you not worry about the action in a area that no one can tell about where the limits of sharing are and where the grey economy is?
It’s the same as a different product.
It is clear that if it will be successful and we go up with it, we will be a further swallow in the eye through the grey economy.
But although someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention of circumventing financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one hand or on the other, will be encouraged to give their income if they make their income.
Why do you think that the service has such a great potential?
The sender will save and the transporter will earn, respectively, reduce travel costs.
This is a strong idea that combines interests on both sides.
At the time of social networks that people divide, we would like to bring this closer.
They can create beautiful stories, people are happy to help someone and tell them about it.
Maybe someone brings you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing personal access for a long time, we say that this app is the service of people.
How do you guarantee that the bulk is uncomfortable?
Each user of the application, along with registration, scans a civilized passport and indicates bank connections, payments or credit cards.
These are channels that give the service to a person as well.
Couriers also collect stars on the basis of sender ratings.
We also offer insurance, we still carry out details.
In case of loss or injury, the shipment is handed over by the court, but does not accept liability for content under criminal law if there is something illegal and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed pack in his pocket or ten pounds of hashish, the criminal liability of the sender is overwhelmed.
Do you risk misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, a supervisory administrative authority who will be able to view it as the only one, and we ourselves are not able to see it, data are protected from abuse.
How much money will you get after successful delivery of the shipping in the hand of the corridor?
The Kuryr determines the price and gets the whole amount he will say about.
The dispatcher is charged by a few percent in addition to the mediation of contact.
These money are our profits, but it's just a few percent because we want to press on the volume.
Nobody can either accuse the shipment of not being delivered when it was actually delivered, the shipment is also verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
What about the size or content of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small like a coat of butter, medium like an egg plate and large like a beer basin.
Then there is no further limitation, and if someone has a place in the car, take the fridge for example.
Plus, the sender has the option to photograph the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don’t even need to pack it if you don’t want to hide content.
You're putting the forgotten mickey in your hand, and that's it.
Who came with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, and I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo of an application with a multinational achievement, which is mainly aimed at a passenger plane.
At that moment, I told him that I wouldn't look for an investor, but I would like to stand for him and save him.
Another year was the development that we founded in London Shippansee LTD for greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not a version on which you are focusing mostly now.
No, marketing has focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to capture the application, as it all had birth pain and is still what to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market is currently not so much.
We know that it’s a long run, but we don’t hesitate, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgraded in their way.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that at least we will learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third Messiah app is local, for the city.
They can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you thanks to the mobile geolocation.
Apps for curriors who want to live with it, we called the Messiah Profi.
So, can someone get used to getting a package out of town?
Exactly, the last application will download in Prague such as a taxi, a student, a mother for a parental vacation, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
As everyone is crazy with those pokemons now, they can collect this entirely the same thing.
A person sees where orders are throughout the city, comes to it, clicks and see when it must be delivered and the shipping is transferred.
It is cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we still create web interfaces that will be difficult for companies to send shipments, fill out data about them on the website, or create points on the map.
We are able to make use of the service every month.
Are you focusing on the full-time project now?
It is hard for us, but we normally have it when we work so that we can enjoy and develop the project.
There is no strong transnational investor behind us, we are two boys, one of whom had a genial idea and the other jumped into it with other initiatives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to make up the Czech market with us, but who should go with us to the world’s product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 will bring nearly forgotten cruelty.
This will make the second part, and the solo game in it will be more pestry than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will move around the standard eight hours, and the filling should be based on the concept of the grid in the first part.
Therefore, you can enjoy freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, also includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will contain levels focused just on reverse movement.
They will resemble plates and include bubbles.
Therefore, it is essential to overcome them, such as double jumps, running through the walls and lane sliding.
Sometimes there will also be a need to eliminate enemies.
There will also be no missing maps that resemble a cluster and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to shut down the plates and close the powerful doors.
You will be able to manage the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should accelerate between dirty events and more calm moments for the exploration of an unknown planet.
We're going to play Jack Cooper's footsteps dreaming about the pilot's career.
Cooper, along with Captain Lastimos, was defeated on the alien planet Typhon, which hosted by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no wildlife there.
In addition, Lastimosa holds a deadly wound in an accident, and Cooper gets the task of carrying out Titan's captain.
His dream of a pilot's career will be fulfilled before he expected.
The first step, however, is to steal the battery needed to repair the robot.
Cooper's talks with titanium will also be significant.
Players will serve as a source of information about the military’s past, but at the same time, robotic communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium is dropping out all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned jump.
The first information on the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be evaluated in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions from the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand is alive, but the original issue remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
In 2013, THQ received a number of brands and the right to use the logo and the company’s name.
For example, Nordic released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are 23 other games, and 13 of them have not yet been released by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old younger man, our neighbour.
I knew that from the beginning - first, they tried for a long time, and then they were together.
It's such a big guy, probably her kind, because she walked with me like that.
She's totally crazy about him.
In the first days, her voice changed, she had such a girl, a loving noise.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she refused.
But I watched it all.
He then went from work regularly at half a quarter, and so she always went to shop at 3 p.m.
She tried to see him every day.
Later I found out that they met him in the bar, in the laundry.
I knew how many times they were there.
I watched the keys, and he was determined to land them there.
But I don’t know why, I’ve always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there to take that decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife's thinking controlled me.
Soon I think she found out that I'm controlled that I'm going to do what she wants.
And I really did it.
Maybe I'm just a bitch.
The neighbors told me that they knew about it.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was scared that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it's all in the family, just a daughter.
So I always delayed it, further and further.
But once I went after him to the apartment that I needed help in the washing machine.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he met my wife and that it all proves that.
I asked him what he would tell me about it.
He stood there, knocked his shoulders, looked at the ground, and did not say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way from the shop at that time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn’t react to it, and she didn’t tell me anything.
No one told me anything at that time.
I am a man who has never gone too much anywhere that has a problem to get acquainted with someone rather than to find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I still trusted that one day it would end.
I thought I'd forgive her all and my life's going on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never done anything that essentially.
I've got it in my own today.
I used to tell her a lot of times before, but I finally left it for calm.
He continues to live in the next house and I continue to live with her.
It's just my wife rather than my master.
She always did everything in the house - cook, wash, clean.
She's working.
I think she always tried to have no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that she is also decent.
But sometimes I would like to look at her, take her and she doesn't leave her.
At the same time, we go for walks and shopping and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She loved me and loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that he loves him so far, that's his god.
And that life doesn't bother me.
When it started, and I was very badly wearing it, I once told her that she didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree with it or not.
And that was what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or not.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's enough place here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslims.
After terrorist attacks, France graduates against radical Islamists and calls for help by the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who disrupt public freedom, it will be harder for France to guarantee their freedom of confession," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is revealed in the country.
He also wants to stop funding from abroad, when preachers often come with money to jedish.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosquitoes and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, the internal disputes reached her, and so she never worked well.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
In the head of the new foundation, the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as the defender of the secular state.
In France there are about 2,500 missions and prayers, about 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic spirituals from the country, and in several dozens of others have been considering this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the Jihadist spirit.
The Immaeans are allegedly accused of warriors for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation in France.
They all accelerated other terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of the mixtures from domestic resources and also to monitor the property.
However, it is not yet clear where the finances are gained, although several proposals are considered.
One of them is a special fees on halal food, that is, mainly on meat derived from defeats under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the dealers of halal food, for the granting of permission.
Some of the money would then be put into the fund's budget.
The contribution from €10 to €20 could also be paid by French migrants who are going to Mexico.
Every year, about 30,000 people leave France on a traditional journey to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers should act in the French mosques who have passed educational programs at those universities.
This means that their ministry should be in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical mosques.
"We have closed them 20 since December, and others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“In France there is no place for those who proclaim hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was severely injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Zaragoza, the newspaper Independent wrote.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage spaces in her car.
The man was waiting in the car before the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned a gun against himself, writes Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital with an uninjured daughter, for men in a critical condition, she had to come to the hospital.
The crime occurred around 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous area of Aragonia, near the local university.
With a appeal to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent wrote that the motif was probably unresolved by the recent divorce of both partners.
Sweatshirts with a screw, sweatshirts and chilli beans.
The summer wants light, well-nutritive foods, only we Czechs are rebels and we have our taste and our head.
And so from the summer gardens smells grilled necklaces, pigs, pigs.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even so sometimes except salad or vegetables.
True, grilling is savings of time and dishes, in addition, it is a social issue and no one must be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to do well, which special tables, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need for a long period of time to excrete, to care, to smash or to suck.
And that will help us improve our health.
Whether it’s home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a couple of well-built graffiti are enough to make the preparation fun and food of the real exotic flavour itself.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here it even takes time to cook and cool rice.
Paper can only be softened into the water for a moment and then depends only on the imagination of the cooker, how you intend to play with fillings and accessories.
It's not like a row.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisines today is that raw materials are usually available.
Including a loaded sugar acid salmon, which is one of the basic flavors of sushi accompanying or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the true pink gary has a unique pikant island and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of octs and the barbecue.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag corresponding to the size, and the annex with evidenced antibacterial effects that promote digestion and resistance to cough or flu is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating foods within the various festival opportunities and rituals.
The long-sized leaves of bananas are widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "aids" for the preparation of various cooked, cooked and dishes that are packed in them similarly as in alobalu.
Banana leaves also give food a special taste.
We can buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into wheels.
But select only the leaves of green grid, and therefore healthy - unforgettable and uncovered.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from sauce, sauce and sauce oil.
You can buy it freeze again.
Who often prepares or prepares sushi will probably know a lot of madness.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seafood, from which it is produced by the so-called fool leaves, which are so-called fools, which are intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – dark green rabbits growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó – is also fresh and dry and is as popular as a number of rabbits.
By the way, those who wouldn’t know the meat of soup with vacuum, Asian women claimed to use it on the basis of recovery after childbirth.
And at all, these many effects are almost miraculous.
Pure blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents grey hair and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and diluted cake also serves as rice, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh garlics are first allowed to dry in water, then dilute, insert in boiling water and cook for a half minute.
Then it cools in the ice water, cut down the middle shrubs and continues to adjust, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it is already ready, dirty, is the easiest solution.
Therefore, it remains just to roll the roll with easy vegetable filling, relaxing and lightweight, full of healthy taste.
That's a long-lasting bomb.
If you resist and don't even get a grilled bowl.
Eat healthy, lightly and summerly.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special raw materials and a little bit of skill, and you have interesting fresh food that pleasantly combines taste.
And it's done twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of marble, 40 g of white rack, 100 g of green chrome, 60 g of salad peppers, 60 g of garlic rice and 60 g of sweet chilli peppers.
Cut coriander bowl, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of chilli squirrels, 20 g manga and 40 g loaded garlic, a little pineapple.
First, we're preparing wraths.
The rice paper will be poured into cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take it out and wait until it gets mild.
In the meantime, in the hot water, we briefly cook crusts, about three minutes later, let them quickly cool into ice water so they don’t lose color.
We put the full of vegetables on the permitted paper and packed.
Prepare the filling from white rice, marrows and salad butterflies that we put on soft nuts, mix them with sweet chilli butterflies, add a cute corander, thoroughly mix and insert on rice paper.
On the banana sheet we insert christmas, add bowls, and finally decorate the whole meal with a series of vacame, loaded with a hint, manga plate, seed black sesame, and add a few pins.
Britain must satisfy the silver in the seven-week rugby, the choice of Fiji takes gold
Britain's personal performance in the seven-week rag ended with a devastating trace of the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro stadium in Riu high 43:7.
The Fijians presented a master’s lesson in processing, sharks, motion, supporting games, racing on the lane and brutal forces - and gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with a priceless relief in the form of a silver medal - for the UK on the third day - and the British could be proud to be in their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven weeks, defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The victory expressed over South Africa 7:5 in the semi-final the same day, may have been killed in the final.
However, Fiji would also be defeated by a full-healthy 15-member team in its form.
The most important thing for the British is not to be comforting, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main curve of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has insulted some of the roads.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, every match was lost in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat is painful, but progress is unfair.
Fiji began greatly, and the British's bubbles were reflected for joy.
For Captain Thomas Mitchell and the other players, it was like running for a number of buses in the movement and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau exploded out of the corner.
The chasomir showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0, and the UK will hardly touch the ball.
Great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua threw touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after the return and in the hours remains more than 1 minute ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravova then penetrated through the little British and reached the lane where he scored.
After conversion to position 29:0, the break followed.
It was as if Fiji were born for the ragby 7s, while the British were still learning to transmit.
That's exactly the way it's.
After half-time, the British made massive changes, and the Fijians' efforts stopped... for a whole four-minute period, which was good compared to the first half-time until after the brilliant game of Fiji Joshua Tuis passed.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing the touchdown to the left corner to increase an 36:7. But the game has long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans were singing, singing flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the entirely funny approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame was still a further attempt to win the Fijians.
She called a pillow, the Fijians feared, and the British fell on the grass completely defeated.
Previously, the same day in the semi-final, Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 and the UK defeated South African Republic in a narrow semi-final - a difference in one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton, thanks to his sharp footwork, broke out the defence line and scored in the second half of the time under the hole.
Marcus Watson, brother Anthony from England's five-year-old team, has secured victory - and finally also a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight against cancer coach for victory in the village race
In these games you will not find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first recording to the last, during 220 punishable explosions in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although two were sitting on the vessel, there were three votes. When the vessel climbed on a level in front of the second Olympic gold behind them in the race of women’s twins, there was still a voice in the vessel with the present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport that achieved such a result.
Their confusion was absolute, in total it was their 39th race, in which they remained unresolved.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as they fly after the water level with elegance labute - do not reflect the nature of victory completely.
With each gold medal of transportation there is a batallion of helpful hands, which mean a difference a little after a piece. And no hands were helpful more than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he was going to experience that day when cancer was detected.
According to his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from urinary mucus cancer that could be operated, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
This will change your view of the thing.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio, it was that it was possible to enter treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, and to shorten the decline to a minimum - if we can call it in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked through the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet, at the time they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
It's a way to celebrate yourself, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual, how he tried to overcome his own neglect.
Stanning, Captain of the Royal Army Shooter, who has a mission behind him in Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it emphasizes how much it means for me, how much we worked with Helen and Robin too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so it's a huge thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't want a better man for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the only race in five years.
The two imposed an enormous rhythm that their rivals couldn’t cope with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning had a very large reserve with Glover.
We were focused at the maximum time.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It’s really important not to get rid of it.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something famous.
We didn’t look forward to today’s firefighter, we just wanted to go well, go out and win the race, which we succeeded.
The two will take a year to think about before they decide what will happen next.
Glover will be married next week, and her next television adventure is Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy that moment.
I didn't want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I have a much better feeling of it,” she said.

Prison?
Rather, let people drive for free, says a taximafia hunter Rubeš to a breakdown charge.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate in Prague are accused, according to ČT.
You have recorded a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices, even those in the group that will be in court.
You have faced several unpleasant hits with uncovered actors.
How much is the report on the complaint of members of the organized group for you?
I was hoping some court would happen.
I'm mostly curious about judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's nothing.
First of all, they should return all the money incurred.
And they should return them so that they will drive all people for free.
That's a slightly self-exclusive solution.
Does that mean that you do not consider the penalty effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they don't work anymore.
For example, one makes ping-pongs, another thinks about pizza, and one gets out of it.
The accused can in theory get two to eight years of prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the removal of freedom.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Close someone in jail, especially in such a case, is insignificant.
Such people should return the company they took.
For the quarter of the century had committed that our country had destroyed the name and had just stolen people.
So let them do a good visit and distribute people for free.
I can't imagine it otherwise.
It would work as a publicly beneficial job.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll finally get the condition and it won't matter to them.
They'll find another way to deceive somewhere.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříčka in Pisa and then at the University of Thomas Bati in Zlína.
It belongs to people who have started with virus videos and videos directly for the website.
He works as an online TV editor for Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of series, now prepares the Prague Guide series, which is mainly intended for foreign audiences.
Rubeš, in the form of short reporting, advises how to avoid services in Prague and what he recommends to use without worrying.
Previously recorded a series of titles How to do it, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, A enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the complaint, they are discussed as an organized group.
Police watched her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxis be called the Mafia?
They're like sweet mafias, not like we know from Kmotra.
It's more about mafias - juniors, but they're definitely organized.
It's just because they're watching each other (taxi station).
Prague is entirely dispersed.
I found that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karl Lazní (disco club) again.
Everybody just cares about their own place, and every group is organized in a way.
It's obviously a web network.
There are only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate officer who warned the drivers against controls.
As you say yourself, the unwanted phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What is the percentage of Prague frauders in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst people in the streets are still.
For example, I am talking about Ales Rijas.
This is a person who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic pocket in his car, and every Friday and Saturday stands at the bridge of Karl and carries people.
When I went with him for the last time, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
His police weren't arrested for any reason.
There were only a few people from all over that big group.
The same is true in other places in Prague.
Therefore, the accusation of seven people is difficult to wash away the already famous Prague distortion, which is apparently much larger.
Of course, it's not at all for anything.
It will help, but all evil will not be cleaned up, that's the truth.
Are taxi drivers stealing foreign tourists still out on the same places you showed in the reporting, i.e. at the Carlo Bridge or in the Paris Street?
Yeah, that's exactly.
In these places they stand every day and every day they break the statements.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's no longer cowboys, but total inconsistency.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them, to be part of the group, get to court.
It's already a diarrhea.
I need to ask: Do you feel satisfied?
If I would take it as an adequacy, it would be bad, because my goal was, and will always be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel that it’s necessary to be a little better, I’ll continue to do it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief remains there, we still have to do something to remove him.
You can't calm down with that.
But it’s not that, of course, there are more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do testing and I have to say it's still bad.
Last week I caught a taxi driver from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (using a trick with a tenth line).
He had a scratch on it, police arrived, and this taxi was so cute that he was still following the police and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver crossed the tenth line and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the burden of fraudulent taxis has not risen even after you have shown in your pictures the faces of those who have counted insignificant amounts for a short drive?
Their courage is still incredible.
How did this taxi driver get 56 crowns?
Police sent him away with the fact that he couldn't talk to him on the spot because he put his bill out.
And I think that's a problem in the court (six taxi drivers and one exured officer).
On the one hand there will be a taxi driver with his accounts, on the other hand the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision, the magistrate shall not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence before the court.
When I recorded pieces of their fraud, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the recordings only.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver would be able to ride for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because it wouldn't survive.
You talked about a trick with a dozen lines, particularly in front of foreign customers, fraudulent taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about using this figl after publishing your reports?
I think we've popularized this trick by sending the series on the other hand.
Lately I went with a taxi driver, and he was proud of me that he was the honorable taxi driver.
Then I noticed that the taximeter was attached to a black leather.
When I asked him what it had, he said, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers did not have the penalties too much, could the court have a warning on them with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can remove them from fraud?
You've talked about the way you think they'll always find the way to deceive.
I don't think it's possible to give them up.
But somebody can get them out of those places.
And that's the Ferro taxi drivers who should take more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that these Fairy taxi drivers in Prague are lucky to be overwhelmed.
Do they taste to go against those who give their service reputation?
They taste, but they miss the mind.
He can't walk in it and can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a comprehensive limitation from the office of Prime Minister Adriana Krnáč), they did not seem very clearly what they actually want.
They once said they didn’t protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as that service, and then they claimed they wanted more than Uber.
It was just blocking Prague and resulting in it only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you appreciate the approach of the Prague magistrate in solving the problem of the driving reflection?
It is obvious that the criminal police had to go into it to solve something.
The Master was short for that.
They had a necklace that carried out information, which means that the taxi department had done his job for several years completely unnecessary.
I hope that the officer will charge this to the last check to realize what he's done.
It's going to be the worst for me.
I was even with him on one check-out, which I found only afterwards from their breakdown.
It has been a few months since the release of the last series.
What's the response?
I mean, mostly for foreign audiences, the series is most focused on.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I'll give them the videos.
And when we go through the Old Town Square, they are surprised that there are the same people that are seen on the pictures, seriously standing.
Unfamiliarly famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put some trails around them to see them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Are you driving a taxi when you need it?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm driving with services I don't have to pay cash, but with cards.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
There are also a lot of disciplines that are fair.
I have taken a taxi only once in the street since then.
The driver said to me, "You have the courage."
I'm dressed for an Italian tourist.
Taxi drivers’ fraudulent practices were written in 2005.
Former Prime Minister Pavel Bém went out on a controlling ride that same year for an Italian tourist, and immediately on the first attempt, the driver hit him with two hundred.
The editor Rubeš had a worse experience.
The drivers of the taxi service charged him for the ride from Old Town to Václavsky Square 820 crowns, which is about 195 crowns per kilometre, according to reporters.
The Prague magistrate has set a maximum price for 28 krones per kilometre.
In the recorded reports, there are also other surprising amounts: for example, the two-kilometer road from the street of Paris to Truhlárska cost a tourist 400 crowns.
The expensive rides were also provided by taxis waiting at Karlo bridge.
For the journey to an angel, which is 2.5 kilometers long, they may also charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is mostly washed with clean water, the more without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities from it go well, although sometimes the screws have to fall down with a scalpel, it is necessary to get rid of the screws.
It's not easy and it's not quick, she approached her work by restaurant Vanesa Trost from Oldrich's in Haji.
A drop down in front of it: the replacement is built with a leather, after which you need to get out countless times and tear again.
"The restoration should be careful, patient and unreliable to the work environment," she said.
In Florida, it is not the first restaurant work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the façade were restored in the rear tract of the Frydling municipality, and also restored the socks of St. Marí Magdalena in Zátiší, St. John Nepomuksky in Frydling, St. Piet in Frydling Round Street, Marian column in Frydling, or under the Atlantis in the New Front.
The renovation of Melchior, Christophe and Katerina from Redern began in Frydlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the nausea of uncleanness and crust, and the freed stone parts will be secured against fall and decay; they will either be crushed into the wall or to each other.
The treatment and surface conservation are also expected.
The writings on the tomb will be rebuilt.
"Then it begins with the collapse of the inscriptions on the marble plates with rice plate gold," said a reporter from the State Memorial Care of the City Office in Frydlant, Vera Sobot.
There are no records in the past that the replacement would have passed through some repairs.
At a closer look, take care of the holes thrown in the marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's the remains after decoration.
He was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the arrival of the Swedens in the Thirty-Year War, everything disappeared.
Literally, they've been looking for a substitute, she said on Saturday.
In the Church of St. Crusade, the restaurants with a mild bowl are as home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to set up a seal that was found underwater, restored a seal, wall paintings in the graveyard and now a seal.
"We would be happy to go into the victories in the future too," said Sobot.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, each year we invest money in maintenance and repair.
The restoration work on the restoration of the Redernova farm will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be deprived of grants, the city in this part of restoration will not invest any of its money.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the winning in the country bike of the 2015 Historic City competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns will then be the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said the mayor of Frydlantu Dan Ramzer.
Representatives decided to release the wins for the restoration of the premises.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indexes and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a month and a half.
Low volatility and growth are dominated in the markets.
Who would say that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which passed 12% of corrections in February, is now at the new historical maximum and has already scored 7% since the beginning of the year.
The Iron Rule is again confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which eventually have always reached their own.
In a situation where U.S. shares at the historic maximum are again falling volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when the markets grew satisfied and without fear due to the quantitative release of the U.S. central banks and when the volatility index (VIX) remained stable under the 12 percent limit.
And not too.
Although the Fed markets continue to prepare for gradual increases in interest rates, quantitative releases in Europe and Japan have been in full current and has also added hand to the Bank of England, which will buy debt of £70 billion in the next six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release presses so low revenue even below and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this state last?
Of course, this is a question for a million.
However, there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without any major volatility, the situation in the commodity market is stabilized and the Brexit is no longer a subject in China, so we might not be surprised if the U.S. action continues in a similar quiet regime.
It's a shame that Juncker doesn't study Clause!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier took this important and challenging task.
I wanted to do this hard work of an experienced policy, said Juncker, the European Commission's Chief Minister, when the French policy (truely experienced because it was shot by so many different transnational political functions that we would hardly look for a better example of the so-called European elite) called the UK's chief negotiator for the European Commission.
Juncker's choice has made signs of hope that the EU is in a serious interest to seek the form of future friendly coexistence with the UK.
However, most British media accepted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
He hates the UK.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He drank it as he could only understand it: the hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
The supporter of multilateral regulations was co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and it is about everything that comes from the City Financial Centre in London, which has passed the legislation of the financial sector and services tough regulations.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the president of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, incomparable, and obviously an unprecedented negotiator.
That's probably not a good news.
In this context, not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovakia Federation, to which so much entertainment has contributed, the overview and the ability to empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
Today, Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
Shame that Juncker from Václava Klause - at least in this - did not learn.
It would be for everyone!
The earthquake around Putin?
The governor of the Kremlin released his closest Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed Sergey Ivanov on Friday from the head of the presidential office.
He'll take Anton Vajno's place.
She informed the Russian media with a complaint to the Kremlin press service.
Putin noted that Ivanova would leave on his own request.
At a meeting transmitted by the TV station Rossija 24, the president said he was out in line with Ivan's wish to enter his office as he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The report on the exchange in the head of the President’s administration, which is now led by Ivanov’s current representative Vajno, is considered relatively surprising.
Ivanov, a 63-year-old, is named one of Putin's closest co-workers.
For example, this former officer of the KGB in the past occupied the roles of Minister of Defense and Vice-President of the Government.
He will now leave the chair of the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov, in his meeting with Putin, said that he was a recordman for the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the state.
He endured four years and eight months in it.
In this context, he recalled that in 25 years from its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this function.
Neither flowers nor deblishers will play the Shafara final.
Neither of the Friday tennis matches have been able to turn into a final.
She lost her first fight, Petra Kvit, who was surprised by the Portuguese Monica Puig after Seths 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
A little while later, the Czech deblist Shafaryva and Uncle Shafaryva followed.
The winner of Williams's sisters in the first seat saw after the winning, but the two seats were missing, and the Russians finally crashed a set in a shortened game.
The second set was lost by 4:6.
The semi-success in the early morning program in Riu recorded the Czech transportation: skier Ondřej Synek won his semi-final overview when the second Damira Martin from Croatia defeated even though the rest of the final was almost a second.
Well today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the Sonek.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the procedure.
So they had some power, it could be easier for tomorrow.
But I don't say it's going to be simple, it's just playing cards to me, said the Passenger of the Duke of Prague.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, but in the Snykers' slices, she wasn't short.
Fifty-year-old villager held in the today’s semi-final in her driving fourth position, and on Saturday she is waiting for the start in the B final and the battle of 7-12 place.
Gold from London isn't so good.
For the first time I didn’t go to the final at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a high quality race and put in everything that was going on.
The opponents were just better, the Topinky Knock came in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get on her fourth games between the elite six.
The fight resigned just before the goal.
I knew that girls were balanced that anyone could get out of that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get to the final through Rakushanko.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, she told the 2011 world championship.
Far behind the final doors in Riu, a young shooter, Filip Nepejchal, who couldn't even get out of qualification for the second time, this time a little laugh.
Nepechal held 33th place in it.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamenskiy was the first to score 629 points, Kirill Grigorjan was the second to score 628.9.
Nepeychal's shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time athletes, including the Czech seven-players Katerina Cachova and Eliška Kluchinova, were also discussed in Riu.
Cachowski belongs to the eleventh place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinova is twenty-two.
It leads British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as continuously the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
They both took care of the historic best high performance within the seventh.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity as asked questions, the German society has experienced a profound self-reflection, but the Russians are not.
In both large Eurasian nations, dictators appeared in the 20th century, and came to the power of regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrifying.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed largely to 94 million victims of communism, which indicates the Black Book of Communism, whether it is a daily individual repression, targeted hunger, incomplète war leadership or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II were estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out animals.
It was not the fault of only a few individuals in Germany or the Soviet Union, but most of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively, or simply by kicking their heads into the sand.
This is not just the specificity of these nations, we are the Czechs in the same way.
In Germany, the denialation of the Norimber Trial immediately ended the war.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they asked him, “Dad, why did you participate in these animals? ”
How can you do that?
This brought real reflection and healing of society.
German elites have long taken care of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the prosperity of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but it is definitely not about connecting them back to Alsasko-Lotrinsko or someone - on the revanch - to attack militaryly - it is probably recognized by everyone.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, no great reflection occurred.
The window of possible positive changes definitively closed at the end of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin reached power.
The crime past is often celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putinovsky Russia is the rebellion, the gain of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of their own people are no value for faithfulness.
Your children, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally less valued - destined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits the growth of tension around Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has worsened at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea area.
Whose voltage growth is beneficial?
After a longer period of relative calmness, further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia has occurred.
The mainland of the Ukrainian party became the Crimean Peninsula, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Messages from both hostile parties, of course, contradict and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we only have the opportunity to think about an old-known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which of course Ukraine refuses and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
For information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia, Savchenkock's known response came from the case that he was allegedly arrested in the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer sounds: in nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only damage Russia, mainly by the West, in the form of further alignment of sanctions and reinforcement of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the background of the immigration crisis to Europe has declined from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s leadership has already lost total credit before its citizens, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long failed to be a sharp financial injection by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs again to draw attention to its country so as to justify its additional requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces want to again show themselves strong men who are afraid of building up the great Russia.
It remains to hope that all those who try to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for not only the lives of soldiers, but all ordinary people on both enemies and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria for the first time in eight months demonstrated inflation
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly inflation rate reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (from June 2012) and the first non-null value since last October when a positive inflation rate of 0.2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI in the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, thus the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (June 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the roads of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Price drops occurred in clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and normal maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. secret services have been watching Russian hacker attacks this year.
Information on Russian attacks came to the public last month, when the Federal Investigation Office (FBI) announced that it was dealing with the attack on the servers of the party center of Democrats.
The Russian share of the attack, however, is not mentioned by any official report.
Moscow rejected the attack.
The report on monitoring the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret because its discovery would reveal that the U.S. secret service would monitor and detect the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian reporters have participated in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The Russian track tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of Congress leaders, called the U.S. gang eight, had been informed of public agents.
It is created by both chairmen of the Chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, presidents of the Democrats in both Chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of Congress Defense and Security Committees.
The official head of the Democratic Party, Donna Brazil, said on Thursday he would create a cybersecurity advisory committee to "prevent future attacks and ensure primary protection of the Democratic Party servers".
There was a dangerous parasite in a loss from Albert.
The chain asked for excuses.
Based on the initiative of consumers to health problems after consuming food Losos wildly taken - pieces of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out Prague hygiene checks in the shops Albert on the Václavsky Square and Na Mostk.
The control found that the L23012562/T4 series with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, to which the customer noted, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same range with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was taken away.
The laboratory test confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
This is a parasithic juice of the digestive tract of seafood.
It is dangerous for a person - the larvae in the body's tuberculosis or the muscles of fish are a strong allergen, and the living larvae seen by a person can penetrate through the wall of the stomach into the inner organs, Sticha said.
We apologize to our customers for the problems of this brand product.
We immediately removed this series from the sale and for preventive reasons we also removed all the other series of this item.
There was a doubt on the side of the supplier we negotiated with, and at the same time we let this product be tested by ourselves, said Albert Barbora Vanko, spokeswoman.
If the customer purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and receive the money back.
Larvae will destroy ice cream and sufficient heat adjustment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
The presence of a dangerous product of hygiene was informed by the Prague and Central veterinary administration.
According to the server of safenesspotravin.cz, people after a parasite relapse may be ill with anisakiosis, which manifests intense abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease may occur without signs, TKK said.
The symptoms will be delivered an hour to two weeks after insufficiently treated fish.
Three weeks after the start of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larves are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are kidnapped either with sufficient thermal processing of fish meat or when frozen.
Veterinaires have currently checked the loss for the recipient of imported goods in the Central Region.
Three of the five tested samples had a parasite.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Expeditioned, mostly into the Ahold chain, has been packed to this day 919.
Currently, non-sales stocks of the product are being downloaded from sales, said SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians prohibited the shipment of additional products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old British wanted to escape from Rakka, probably killed her by a Russian strike.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist, who had been killed by the killings, there was an excitement.
The expected chaliphate paradise for British girls turned into a hell of a land from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to her relatives, was in contact with her sister Halimou.
She repeatedly called her to Britain and believed she wanted to go home.
To leave the Islamic State is like trying to escape the Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without a sense, says The Telegraph family lawyer Tasnima Akunjee's deceased girl.
The last tracks led to Rakka, where the girl called for the last time.
Then there was only a report about her death, but she couldn't be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in eastern London.
Together they discussed how they could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They hoped that they would meet the former student again.
Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house in which she stayed compared to the country in May, the British ITV News said.
The TV added that the bomb was probably fired by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child from a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when Kadiza was thinking about escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was arrested in an attempt to escape and, according to the information available, publicly killed.
I think she explained it as a warning and decided not to risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old girlfriends from school Shamimou Begum and Amira Abas released on the trip on 17 February last year.
They just said they were going out.
But they moved to Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey to the territory of IS.
The family of the lawyers did everything they could to get Kadizu back.
You would take blue from heaven just to get your child from a dangerous area and this family did everything she could, pushed all the strength to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking that they would be caught themselves, a lawyer added.
The only positive thing he says is that Kadizy's fate can serve as a terrifying case for other girls or even boys who are letting ahead of Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases when people came out there, realized how things were there, understood how far it differs from the promises of the Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadizi's comrades is unknown.
But as they also have been quiet, their families have to deal with the fact that they are most likely dead.
In jail for money.
In Scotland you can go for a grid without committing a crime.
For centuries, the town of Inveraray was the country center and headquarters of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held in the municipality and the sovereign has served as a local prisoner.
Conditions in which the trespasses lived were sad, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them even successfully.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move prison spaces to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive to prisoners, having heating and gas lighting.
However, it has not been in operation for a long time, its closing has occurred for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair facility was expensive and was not paid too much.
The stories of the treasurers and the ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened for centuries later, visitors can compare the old building with the new to convince themselves how different conditions in them ruled.
The guides to the authentic experience of the epoch costumes are still strengthening.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can find out what forms of crimes were applied to the criminal, whether it was fingerprinting or fire marks on the body.
Within the exams, tourists can be allowed to close to one of the duties, mostly due to a photograph on the memory, or to make instructions for the feeling that the prisoners experience behind the nets.
In addition, Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish locations where he is allegedly scared.
There have already been several groups of hunters of paranormal activities, and so far the museum allows people to come to hunt some ghosts.
This night, however, will cost 300 pounds, which is calculated about 9,500 krones.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the area also attracts great food, surrounding panoramic views and history.
"Animé" effect on Snapchat is criticized as Asian curriculum
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially sensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that limit absurdity.
You can make yourself an ananas, a dog or a character that looks like Roy Lichtenstein’s picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any fault will be released immediately.
Snapchat’s filters used criticism in the past with allegations that the app promotes blackfacing or supports white skin shades as an ideal for beauty.
So, when this week it offered users a filter that would allow them to have sharp eyes, toothbrushes and dirty faces, some critics labeled it the racist Asian caricature - yellowface.
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions indicate a larger problem of society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and news and puzzles quickly expanded, and Snapchat immediately announced that the function was cancelled the next day.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to characters anime, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But observers who were witnesses of racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes of action.
Others without the pack refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet on photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least harmful and ridiculous."
He added that “it is hard to argue against comparison of obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It appears that the filter is not only about yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is questioned to the rigid extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
The American culture seems to have an infinite struggle for diversity and inclusion, from meeting rooms in corporations to Holywood and equipment we all wear in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that you can expect even more sensitivity.
“When a single Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said Katie Zhuova in an interview on Thursday, “it is very difficult to cover these things today without notice as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete Snapchat’s account and invite others to do the same.
In the article for Medium and the telephone interview, she said she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s workforce.
Katie Zhuova criticized overwhelmingly white, totally male company leadership and the article finished hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they have no diversity between employees and colorful people at the time when they decide about these things,” Zhu, a Chinese-American, said, “or that colorful people are working there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left significantly without a response.
The Company does not disclose numbers relating to the diversity of its employees with the status of a private company.
Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees on Thursday, but, according to the spokesperson, he recently adopted a recruitment employee who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and the internal management of inclusion.
Zhuya adds: “I’m wondering if they really need other users who can say that it’s wrong,” by keeping their account cancelled.
Military officers dismissed reporting information about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued on Thursday that U.S. Central Command officers have changed reporting reports to create a more optimistic image of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the country's events.
According to the preliminary reports of the working group composed by the Republican President of the Armed Forces Committee, the Reporting Service Committee and the Defence Subcommittee, it was found that the analysts of the Central Reporting Service, under which their supervision had changed their assessment of the U.S. efforts of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is a central army in Tampas, Florida, supervising American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release, the reporting secret services approved by supervised officers of Centcom usually offered a more positive image of US anti-terrorism efforts than confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analysis obtained from other parts of the reporting social media.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when an incorrect analysis is submitted to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The failure of Centcom leads to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central State in the description and analysis of U.S. efforts in the training of Irish forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive proof that Obama’s top officials ordered the reports to be changed, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure by Centcom’s leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers presented by the Islamic State or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central State press reports, statements and statements from Congress were substantially more positive than what events were actually," the report said.
For example, Centcom’s representative publicly stated that a major military attack on Mosul’s capture could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is entirely clear after months of investigation," said Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican party in Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position of U.S. central state reporting service workers have manipulated the state reporting service outputs in order to aggravate the danger of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after they learned about the concerns of analysts that information about the reporting services concerning the Islamic State is manipulated.
According to the report published on Thursday, further investigation must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
In the reporting services of Centcom, further investigations are conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
The Democratic members of the Reporting Services Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the findings of the Republican working group.
"Before 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very close process for the evaluation of information about IS and Iraqi security components," said Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Democracy Representative in a statement.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "has led to the crossing of the outputs of news services," damaged the morality between analysts and "have insufficiently taken into account disobedient opinions."
However, Schiff and Democrats claim that they have not found any evidence that the White House would try to push on the analysts of Centcom to adjust their conclusions according to "predictions or political situations."
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported the investigation of Pentagon Inspector General, which was launched after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Lieutenant Patrick Evans, spokesman of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector-General is still continuing.
However, he said that “as a matter of time, advocates don’t agree to interpret complex data, and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental issues of national security.”
The investigation has the impact on the framework of the question of whether the American bombing conducted in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement that now declares the growing number of defence representatives).
However, the last accusation raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central state being honestly evaluating the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.
The reporting criticism of the Islamic State reflects conflicts for more than a decade when reporting service analyst Centcom Gregory Hooker wrote a research work in which the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq in 2003, which will only be devoted to the year.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the reporting services of the Islamic State.
Last year, the authorities reported that Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements of opposition, air strikes led by the Islamic State refineries were not significantly weakened because the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transferred outside the central state.
Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate with too positive war assessments.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
The U.S. won ground hockey in the fourth row, so today a decisive match will be played in the UK team
Katie Bam in the match against Japan, which ended with victory 6:1, shot three branches and just a day after that for the U.S. women's land hockey team shot the first two branches of the match in which America defeated India on Thursday 3:0.
Five brackets in two matches are a good memory success, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if something like that had ever happened.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of those who record their doors.
But this knows: Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to 4:0 matches and are divided into the first place in the group with the UK, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained undefeated.
The United Kingdom and the United States will conflict on Saturday in the last first round match.
Both teams qualified to the quarter-final and the match decides who of the group six teams ends in the first and who in the second.
The team from the first place will be avoided for a little longer by the strong Danishs who are in front of the second group.
Whatever the match ends on Saturday, the Americans here made their surprise ride a break, four years after ending between 12 teams in London.
There was also Bam in that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took her home hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sister played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became her youngest player ever.
She escaped from the 2008 Olympics because she failed to finish the final auction.
In 2012, she didn’t have much to do with her or her team members.
The next year he was appointed coach of the Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we had no work rate as we have today.
We've made a full turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started shooting a famous branch in the first half.
India played in the match without a win in the tournament, but the team appeared as surprisingly hard and kept the score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped the left side of the toy field, then climbed into the middle and shot the ball into the gate to get the Americans into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in the fourth quarter.
Jackie Briggs, who helped in each of the three winnings, was the first in the tournament.
It's in great form.
Just like Bam.
“We are in a good place now,” Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympics
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter how long it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Riu de Janeiru it feels persistent, unwritten and engaged in exchange of competitiveness and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic origin itself would be a burning staffing belt, which is transmitted by the swimmers, gymnasts and triathlonists.
You can’t turn on TV, read newspapers, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the fraud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Closem.
And then is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming girlfriend of women with haircuts in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and may also be among those whose names will sound at homes in the main broadcast time between advertising and spots of sponsors, if he was a swim, gymnast, or even a shepherd.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, fights for the Olympic gold in the jumps on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not light all competitions likewise.
Far from midnight, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, luxury shooting, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me warn about the inevitable magic of the trampoline.
Although jumps on the trampoline Olympic sports since 2000, when they were first introduced in the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I have asked, not even knowing that it is the Olympic sport.
It can be regional inconsistency.
The U.S. never medalled at the trampoline jumps and no athlete had ever been at the final until 2012.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will play Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The trampoline jumps, however, have another smile, partly because the ear of an undedicated will seem more fit to the Clune University than to the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast from the country.
It has a comic potential - the comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the latitude of gymnastics and swelling, two sports that combine in itself.
The word "trampolin" is derived from the Spanish "el trampolin", which means "Scott board".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to nearly 10 meters in height and presents compositions with several elements (salts, wires and combinations) before they finally rise again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by implementation, difficulty and "times in the air".
Athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Riu.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic road is ahead.
The fighters for the gold medals must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They try not only to touch the target belt or the start wall, but, as stated by a TV news report, also another imaginary line: the world or the Olympic record.
This one-of-a-kind effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatic - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's a bit tired of watching the Olympics at the same time.
Trampoline jumps in this regard bring relief.
The athlete's path on the trampoline is upwards.
It's not a move forward.
He or she is reflected as if they were in a state without a stitch like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but during the period of the compilation, there will be no harsh struggle for achieving the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect time and gravity.
This is just the closest to the Olympics and Zens.
Women's qualifications and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13:00 East Time, and men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will be finally broadcast within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 hours.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably review through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only by the fact that male athletes will be subject to loving views and weight loss - as the U.S. gymnasts recently proposed - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for their new fans who fall asleep.
“Protending Generation” in Ethiopia, a long-term allied of the United States
Violence protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have challenged the violent resistance of the government.
The witnesses argue that many protesters have been shot during conflicts with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-governmental disturbances have evolved into more and more areas.
In the last week, thousands of people have arrived in the streets that require significant political changes.
According to the organizations fighting for human rights, the reaction of the government was unpleasant.
The witnesses argue that police have shot and killed crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from protests that are likely to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year are captured by security forces as young people have holes after they have been forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to make a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second most humanitarian nation in Africa and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and reporting services are closely working with Ethiopia to eliminate the dangers of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few of African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been substantially improved – even a new train ride in the capital of Addis Abeba.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, it is difficult for Ethiopia to be described as a pattern of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without speaking about governmental repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, the disidents have been effectively silenced.
Many of them were convicted, imprisoned, murdered, or expelled away into the desert.
But that can change.
"When people dough and they have no other option than protests, there will be a breakdown," said Seyoum Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
They protest all youths.
He protests the entire generation.
The complaints are many and concern everything from ground disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last elections that were widely criticized, the government party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100% in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this unprecedented, controversial border has demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists are afraid that separatist groups, which have been more less under pressure over the past few years, such as the Roman Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, can try to use and re-armed the confusion.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of smoking under the surface, these burning feelings again burned up.
The first one is apparently harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate via social networks up to the last few years when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and Internet services have improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as it usually happens mainly during protests, many people can still communicate via the Internet proxy that hides the location of these people.
A few young Ethiopians talked about how they gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Orom and Amhar are not natural allies.
After long ages, the Amhars, mainly from the Christian tops of Ethiopia, came out of politics and trade and used Oromy, many of which are Muslims and live in the Lower.
But it also changes.
“We are on the way to a single leadership,” said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of the Roma.
The biggest protests took place in the regions of Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the ethnic Tigris, which constitute about 6% of the population and control army, reporting services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian government president for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered uninformed illness.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who was able to see him as a corner.
Analysts say that he was particularly mastery capable of revealing the initial signals of discontent and using the ambassadors to process and gain opponents on his side.
“The current regime loses basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Ethiopian government president, Hailemariam Desalegn, was extracted from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, which originated in the Tigris region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam originated in the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in security services controlled by Tiger.
Many are afraid that there will be a further blood flow.
Last time, Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what the analysts referred to as the elections that the government dropped and then stole.
He followed a hard intervention during which many Protestants were killed – even though less than in recent months – and this period of anxiety passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is clear that the progressive rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
There is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the city of Gondar attacked business companies owned by Tigres and the raid against Tigres on social networks is increasingly common.
Analysts say protests are put into the unpleasant situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government uses Ethiopia as a base for drones flying over neighbouring Somalia, although it recently announced that the base was closed.
While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its allies to break down in so constant areas.
"That," said Abdi, "it's a very sharp feeder of brass."
Donald Trump explains his statement on Obama and financing IS as “sarcasus”
Donald J. Trump attempted on Friday to aggravate the latest controversy that flood his campaign, declaring that he did not mean it seriously when it took several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist groups.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an unpleasant situation, who tried to defend him in a stormful time, and must explain that he may not mean his notes seriously.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed a statement on Thursday and continued in interviews that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton had created IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was the opposite of the old one-day allegation when Trump said in several interviews that his accusations were on the contrary serious.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt attempted to help Trump relief the note, he reminded Obama to strive to destroy IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at the moment when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences fall in pre-election surveys.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in a duel of economic issues in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this issue again.
He warned again that Clinton’s proposals are associated with tax increases, and said that his speech was somewhat boring.
Trump used the defence of sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he dismissed the wave of criticism, when he proposed that the Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, his comment later explained the words: “I am of course sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to calm them as necessary.
“I think that’s his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction, then, in one or the other way, “developed explanations,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who was watching the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that it is reverse in its statements and knows that they are depressed enough to make it possible to explain them differently.
Because the results of the pre-election surveys continue to decline in his benefit, Trump has chosen a more sharp tone in the last days, rather than making things calm for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a large deviation behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very closely behind her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid excuse for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his criticism of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with how Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s laughter pointed out his devoted followers, who must stand behind him publicly, whatever his notes are provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former New York City prime minister, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in a CNN interview.
“I believe that what he says is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked Trump’s credibility claims that Obama and Clinton were founded by the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he completely wrongly called a newborn, and that was because he dropped his army from Iraq.
Most common Republicans are trying to argue by allowing the Obama government, in which Clinton acted as Foreign Minister, to be able to deal with the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday’s Pennsylvania meetings, Trump continued on Twitter to fire the media because of their dismissal of every word and their imprisonment against it.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic" TV students who tried to understand him and said, "It can't!"
Several Democrats apologized for Trump’s apology that it is just another proof that it is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop was printed out of the market price. Now returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a stunning place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee was served for 15 years.
Of course, it was found that she was pulled out of the house's front at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that was replaced by Verb in the summer of 2014 - sells bacon in the form of cake.
The locals were crying as the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple on Twitter wrote: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel, and from Verb is now a myrrh shop.”
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-revelation.
The Resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verb has a wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and dominate a similar, modest atmosphere there.
Coffee is also good.
Cisco Rodriguez is the manager of the new Verba, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
It started in Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same furniture supplier and bought the same model of the machine for espresso.
He even used the light from the old Verb again.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new too.
He started using new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with sauce, eggs and cheese and toppings such as cabbages and brown siblings.
You can also find brown rice masks.
The cafe no longer offers beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez noticed a permanent flood of original stamgasts.
“Several original customers had to move from Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliver.
Mrs. Oliver (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequently went to Verb Cafe.
She came back even when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found out that what I like was coffee and culture in Verba,” she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day he gave a mixed coffee, another news instead of his usual ice coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been devoted to Verba since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eight days, as an hour, I'll come and prepare for me all the harvest and ointment."
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new additives to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what is usually, but sometimes he leaves to give all of the salad, eggs, and chicken on his stomach.
Rodriguez said he wasn't sorry for his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make special butter for Verb and to use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an additive.
“I think we could still use it,” Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to put it out soon to make his new neighbours feel like home here.
The new place has further advantages.
Local producer of fruit juices wants to drop into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe extends to the neighbouring building.
Many customers are enough to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the café opens again, go in and get coffee as if it were coming home.
"I missed that smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after his appointment to the President’s office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Workshop and lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from the 5th avenue, such as a juice of cakes and a mari's juice soup.
His menu for this day, however, was more modest: the devil's way of eggs in paradise, potato pyrees, and as a dessert of swestk pudding.
“It was an act of cook solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
A couple who lives in Brooklyn Heights is dedicated to gastronomical history.
Andrew Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a home at Lower East Side through food.
Their new shared work “A Square Meal”, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during a major economic crisis.
They demonstrated cook solidarity with the reporter and met at dinner in Eisenberg’s sandwich store, a small strict buffet in Flatiron’s neighbourhood, which has been in operation since the time of the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered butter cheese and sandwich with dried olive trees, Andrew (57) gave him a crochet, potato cash and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbonate, which, according to the pair, was greatly engaged in a meal interview during the crisis.
“The carbans were very popular,” said Mrs. Ziegelman.
He was selling burrical, liver, and fazole carbonates.
They were made from that direction and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Take a look at the amount of bubbles you should eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe was silent.
"They would lie to you in your stomach like a flour," he said.
In years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a snack buffet that you eat.
Women's teams cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served a freshly cooked cake.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" looks at how the nation was confronted with the fact that it was not a land of abundance at once.
"It was the time when food became a central, scared point for the American people," Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was also scared: mysterious foods, such as carbanates and casternuts, casternuts as “a stunning way to use the residues,” Ziegelman noted, because cookmen could hide non-esthetic additives under the layer of cream potato.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American food - has become a saving luxury.
Strange mixtures that should serve as a caloric and nutritional filling were preferred to taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
During the surveys for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal from a sealed cibulle filled with butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite rise to the dinner table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surrealistic.”
Butter butter with peppered cider does not go together.
It was typical for many home recipes.
So, as never before and never later, domestic economists - including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Office of the Homeland Economy in 1923 to 1943 - ruled the country's nutritional habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, invited women to take the burden of the budget, and snacks, such as spaghetti with marble, turned into tasteful foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of the historical history.
First of all, the experiences emerged in response to the government’s hungry citizens, such as the post of President Herbert Hoover “I give myself a cake”.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as a chosen millionaire he became.
"Rad ate continental cuisines, such as fish with oak chicken," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in a nearly dismantled room, he had smoking on his own.
He was incredibly old.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistakes if his wife, Eleanor, would not have forced him to be an example of his own stomach.
According to the book, Ms. Roosevelt hired a hospod who was not interested in the taste at all, resulting in the fact that the White House “wasn’t giving almost the most spoonureal food throughout Washington, but also the most unpleasantly prepared way.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis have re-established as soon as the country re-established.
The link remained in our continuous examination of calories and nutritional values, says Mrs. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
A couple says that while writing the book, they better understand the nutritional habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw food out.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman commented: “The people were wrong with her.”
There was an accident with a candlestick.
When they had clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert that they prepared at home: a dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a sauce cream," Ziegelman said, and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream, just soups, a little bit of milk, sugar, water and cows.
Everybody unwillingly burned a teaspoon into a thick brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
As the right master said to his wife, "It would have been a little bit of the haircuts."

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation in case of a C-type Yellowness Patent against Merck Group
The court of the District Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to pay the charges for lawyers initiated to it in the case of a C-type patent against Merck & Co Inc.’s pharmaceutical manufacturer.
In June, a judgment was cancelled that Gilead had to pay 200 million for damages due to breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeatedly unlawful acts on the side of Merck, including other lies under oath.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to forgive the fees arising in connection with the representation of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation of drugs against C yellowing market, which can heal more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and argued that they were the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of the medicines from Gilead.
U.S.-supported military units say they have gained full control over the city of Manbídž
U.S.-supported military forces have gained full control of the northern city of Manbídž near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic State escaped from the city, the spokesperson said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now passing the city after leaving the rest of a group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units have released more than 2,000 civilians who were detained by radicals, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF alliance and the military council of Manbidge.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still looking for it,” said Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2%
Hillary Clinton released its taxation for 2015, which indicated that the presidential candidate for Democrats and her husband had $10.75 million in the year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton spent $1 million on charity, mainly to Clinton Foundation. Expresident Bill Clinton contributed to the common cash for nearly $5.3 million for lectures, and the former Foreign Minister admitted a revenue of $3 million for his ministry.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have released a tax recognition in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still a pattern of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and resigns from his previous promises that his tax confessions will be published.
It is a habit that U.S. president candidates will publish their tax recognitions, even if they do not have the law.
Trump, a New York trader, and his lawyers cited the audit of the U.S. Department of Finance as a reason for his refusal to publish taxation.
“Your move,” said Hillary Clinton’s affiliate campaign on Twitter, linking to the tax recognition of a Democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, said CNN would not allow Trump to publish tax recognition until audits are completed.
According to Trump’s critics, among whom the 2012 Republican president is Mitt Romney and other Republican parties, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, trade transactions, and various other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton was strongly in the issue and released a video on Friday reminding the high position of the Republicans on Trump to urge to publish their tax recognitions.
On Thursday, he will mention the question in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidential office have done for decades - to publish their tax recognitions," she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no taxes or very low taxes over the past two decades, and the New York Times publicist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim that this can be so at present.
Federal tax rates have become a theme in the president's election.
Clinton is promoting the rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett to ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million per year will pay at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at Clinton’s meeting in Omaza, Nebraska, where the Berkshire Hathaway Buffet’s conglomerate resides, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax confessions.
Buffett said he also passed the IRS audit and said Trump was “not afraid” of the financial office, but voters.
Clinton’s campaign released tax recognition back until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax on average of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax on approximately 40.5 percent.
According to Clinton’s 2015 taxation, unlike most Americans, it’s just $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton reported revenue on dividend and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fire equipment to protect elephants in Tanzania
Nature protectors in Tanzania use a non-orthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human housing - they throw into them condoms filled with chili powder.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea several years ago, along with the U.S. Environmental Organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and educates volunteers in northern Tanzania villages, how to protect their homes and their fruit in four steps.
Many of them used copies for their defense before.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to protecting these animals.
“Since this set of tools has been developed, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People believe much more that elephants are able to keep them out of their fields without injuring them,” said the CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and second step is to consecrate the battery on the passing elephant and launch the clakson.
If it doesn’t betray him, it’s going to be thrown out of the so-called “chilli cloud”.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with petar pack into the condom, its end is captured so that it only looks at noon.
After combustion, the condom explodes and the thin powder of chili breaks into the air.
The elephant is usually enough and the elephant appears in another direction.
The last option is to decompose the fire that causes a voice, clear explosion.
The Jewish director crashed at the hotel in Berlin for removing the code for calling to Israel for “a demand” of the Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin issued an interruption in the media after finding that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin does not have a code for calls to Israel, according to the employee's words based on the "request" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary picture of the Holocaust "Shoah", ventilated his frustration from the Hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the state has not been identified among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel via its own call center.
The director searched for an explanation and contacted the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received was Lanzmann, according to his words "shock".
The hotel’s employee responded that the measure was “decided after taking into account Kempinski Hotels’ leadership.”
The reason for this step has pushed the director even more.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and asked for Israel's call code to be deleted," Lanzmann said in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador in Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, the case called a "great deception".
We were frightened and shocked by the events.
It's just a huge shame about yourself.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," he said.
The event caused a strong reaction online, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the hotel Kempinski simply “was lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanks to you," is stated in another post that indicates that the hotel located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm is near the synagogue.
According to the newspaper Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly made any charges by designating the event as a "review" and Lanzman's "excuse".
“There has never been a direct order issued” not to include Israel in the call code list, said Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of Kempinski.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
The conflict between students and police took place in Brazil on Thursday, when students met at a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police against protesters used tear gas and rubber projectiles.
The problem was lost when government order services tried to understand students, ending with the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
A few hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns from the plans.
Among the proposals of San Paulo Geralda Alckmina State Governor to save money is to close nearly hundreds of public schools and move 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were able to see how they received letters on the wall against temporary President Michel Temer.
The most recent protest comes just a few days after demonstrators went out into the streets in support of President Dilmy Rousseff, when the Senate decided to complain of her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryana has increased by 70,9 percent after sanctions have been cancelled between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since the cancellation of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest by Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies rebuild existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s export to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumping increase in the trade has ensured the supply of machinery equipment, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visa to Iranians, mostly tourists.
Iran has first been among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be overcome last year,” he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians, and the Ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
“I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scott Callum Skinner hurried home after British gained gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland joined the fame room last night at the male team sprint at the Riu Velodrome, when the VB team trio defended the title from London in 2012.
The thirty-year-old family of Glasgow was in the role of the brake taken for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man of the legend was pleased when he reached the goal and stole a victory from the hand of the favored New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won surprisedly, and Hoy won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth world championship in the race cycling in March, even though Hoy finished his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was replaced by Jamie Staff's special introduction racer.
Hindus has just appeared in time.
After Hoye’s departure, there was also a place that tried to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoyy Champion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record at qualifying, but trikot took the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team's sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in the strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher conversion to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position of BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes went to the stadium, he did not leave their eyes.
Skinner, a thirty-year-old from Glasgow, said, “It’s a lithotic comparison.”
I'm here to get the best from me and honor my name.
We created the Olympic record in the final and won the best.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After the triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he fell on the road just after a weak start.
He later revoked the note and the British opponents had no chance to withdraw.
This time, there was no such problem around this victory.
"With all these British flags on the tribunes, I looked like in London."
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation who won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is an indicator of progress in the last five months, then we are waiting for a successful five days on the road.
With the form that Kenny presented, it is unthinkable to repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
That would then be for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, also has a birthday March 23 (this date seems to be celebrated for British sports, this day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold medals and one silver medals.
Just like how much Hoy got.
As another, Kenny will participate in a sprint that begins today and lasts three more days.
The eighteen-year-old born of Bolton said: “I enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You win with others.
To say the truth, winning for himself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should win the Knight's title."
It was the only medal race that day, but the UK was expecting further good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest to the four-kilometer match race.
It ends with time 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first wheel and finals (22:42) are held on the second day of the race, on which Wiggins will focus.
Yesterday before the qualification race he discussed with the Commissioner when the arbitrator asked him to measure the height.
In a similar race of women that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shando, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie achieved the world record at 4:13.260.
The VB team relyed on its strong team of cyclists and managed the mid-year Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances, showing absolute prevalence in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during preparation for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events occurred, in the last row of the resignation of technical director Shane Suttone in April for the accusation of sexism and discrimination, and the ending of the career of giant such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as it proves the first night of the race on the velodrome, it appears that the legendary reputation that the UK team is able to give the top performance with the perfect time could be confirmed again.
Uncertain future of the table in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium board in Victory - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that the company supplies electricity and which informed one of the board owners of the intention of ending the electricity supply contract.
This step takes place after the government of Victoria decided earlier this year that it would not approve of grants that the company maintains.
The validity of the twenty-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland may be at risk of up to 2,000 jobs.
When closing, up to 2,000 jobs can be threatened - directly or indirectly.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be further lavinovit effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry table in 2014, which led to the closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s tavern in Portland is distributable and threatened to close it.
This step follows after several years of speculation on the future of the company, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices of the production of the factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley valley, has announced that it is expected that one of the three other owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
Most of the factory owners are the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the portland race to continue to work, so, in other words, the demand for electricity from the tavern will continue,” she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called “security contracts” which should enter into force since November 2016.
The Treaties have a 12-month declaration deadline, which will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will participate in the profits for the fiscal year 2017,” the power plant said.
Any possible impact on the AGL profits since the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited thanks to the strong view of the commodity market for wholesale prices of electricity.
AGL said it had already written the value of the contracts according to its accounts of $187 million “for the event that it would end.”
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect its ... ability to operate a table or secure electricity supplies to a table.”
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would start to pay from November this year, although it still had to explain why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the portland table in Victory and the Tomago factory near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, operating leader, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity per year.
If these two companies were withdrawn from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It wouldn’t be good for us as a manufacturer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of Kardashian real estate TV show - now it's the light of Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and the fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-manager clan, appeared on the title page of the U.S. magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador to Estee Lauder, who presented the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when looking at this title page," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed a strange (or simply a continuation of humor in the presentation of Kardashians?) a screenplay video in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenners (barough exhibitors Rob and Caitly and together with them are a cluster in a tailor-made tailor-made tailor-made tailor-made uncle, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrean.
It’s a limited row of almost every “native birth” part of the children’s television show (Seacrest tells: “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the honesty of a drawn chicken in the series at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris needed to make sure the other girls could be on this audience somehow.
Because when we look at the Vogue magazine's eye number, we're sure we've entered the new Kardashian era.
The older sister Kim may have printed Kendall on Vogue’s cover (which was on her in April 2014 with her husband Kanye West), but the title of the magazine’s release is another league.
Vogue is the best-selling number of the year.
The edition, which is more like a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista noted that from 832 pages in the last edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it’s not surprising that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista, or Kate Moss.
Over the past few years, more "celebrits that make models" have appeared on the title page than "models that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar holder and Ambassador to Dior, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later she was honored by Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which the magazine describes as a "complete model" of its generation - falls into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not the relatives of familiar people, nor the stars of real estate shows, nor the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (and when Jenner represents this all).
They are provenly talented women who are excellent in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course not everyone is enthusiastic about Jenner's success.
Her positions in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, Victoria’s Secret’s original model in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her “the damn of the moment.”
These feelings were once again burning with the report that Jenner would appear on the Vogue River.

Community Legal Aid Centers Refuse 160,000 People Annually
More than 160,000 most threatened citizens are denied legal assistance every year in community centers and in the sector themselves will have further restrictions on over-the-sized services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly advanced people, immigrants, threats to workers, victims of violence, and people without funding to fight unfair migration, etc. - are rejected at the moment they are seeking free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already struggling to break down, are going to further cracks.
As of June, these legal aid centres will receive more than 30 percent of federal finances.
James Farrell, director of the Community Centers for Legal Aid in Queensland, said that according to the latest report by the National Association of Community Centers for Legal Aid, 5,000 people were rejected every year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would deteriorate without cancellation of the federal government’s decision.
"Community centers for legal assistance in Queensland are chronicly under-financed, which means that thousands of people are rejected vital services they need," he said.
People who escaped from relationships with a violent man, people with excessive debt, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all these people have problems with the legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, leading to the fact that thousands of more threatened people from Queensland will have to be aware of complex legal issues without help.
We call on the State Attorney and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to prevent this shortening of finances immediately to get the assistance they need when they get into legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State has received its commitment to provide funding for legal aid up to a global average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers of legal assistance and the community of their clients and the government of Palaszczukova must invest in this important work.
Trump’s complaint about Donald Trump’s campaign after state member allegedly targeted a weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was filed a complaint for alleged inactivity after they were informed that the North Carolina Operations Director targeted a gun to a member of the state during the jacket ride in February.
The incident was described in a court letter, which passed by Vincent Bordini, former software trainer in the state on Wednesday at the Charlott State Court.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months to resolve the situation internally before he concluded that “it will not happen so.”
Director Earl Phillip “marked the fingers of the gun, put the right command to the booth, and targeted Vincent’s head to the booth,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The record states that Bordini, after a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people experienced the same with Phillip.
"The guns must not be shot to cause damage," Bordini said in a complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate called for a resignation when he told voters in North Carolina that the arms owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. in the second addition of the Constitution) could be deployed if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected to the court.
Trump’s campaign says that the media of his words have gone out of the context and that Trump has not denied violence.
Bordini in the complaint calls for a compensation to the campaign for unprecedented supervision and to Phillip for threats to personal security, illegal use of violence and cause emotional damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the report with a comment request.
The attempts to get the statements from Phillip were failed.
The WCCB, a local newspaper branch in Charlotta, announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No one responded to the call to his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services in a short period of time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain has to expand the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
Heathrow is very attractive to me, just like London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were a huge benefit for Startford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local community we will create 10,000 new educational jobs, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people who will think Heathrow’s expansion is too large.
It was told that Britain will never be prepared for the Olympics and we will be laughing at the world stage.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow they were not right.
It will always be necessary to tackle obstacles, but Heathrow will be able to answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project, in which many people and companies are involved, not only a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment at the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow who, with a set budget, introduced an investment program in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds, starting with the T5 terminal - which was elected the best terminal in the world for five years, after the T2 terminal, which was built among the two most cruel injuries in the world.
They are now ready to deliver the third ranch, followed by £16 billion of private investments.
London games in 2012 were a huge success in the UK and I am convinced that Heathrow’s expansion will also be.
It is time to further spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, to ensure trade in the future and to leave the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Board of Directors and former deputy for business affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a cat and mouse game in advertising blocking
Out of the attempts to overcome advertising blocking programs, for companies that earn online marketing, it has become a game for cats and mouse. At least one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, so only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad filters on its desktop sites, Adblock Plus published a post on its websites stating that users can update the filters in their program and again block ad on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change encoding around ads to make it more complicated for ad filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock now claims that new codes have already been completed.
Adblock’s spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source advertising blocking community and those who are trying to overcome it takes from the time when the blocking of advertisements has been invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come with another correction.
The fact that the company has engaged in the world’s largest social network in the war only shows the big problem with blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, last year, Pagefair conducted and Adobe uses around 200 million people worldwide advertising filters – almost four times as much as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84% of the profits from Facebook advertising, Facebook visits 1.3 billion active users every day.
Speaker said the company is going against advertising filters on desktops because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social networks and Instagram are not working.
Advertising on desktops still represents profits so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update the ad preferences (ad ad settings) tool to allow people to better check how ads are displayed.
Facebook announced on Thursday that Adblock’s new filters are worried because they may also block content that is not related to advertising on the website.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and therefore we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman hits a Swiss car
The victim was on the road in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an event that on Thursday morning, a woman wished several cars on the road, who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight in the quarter.
The police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the "devastating crime" was lying in the dark on the road and wanted a few cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman at the age of 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers were already interrogated, but according to the police, all of them were still not identified. Police invited these drivers and all the others who were witnesses of the accident to sign up.
Criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation such as this," the lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneva.
It is still necessary to determine whether one of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This is what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not seem to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking through the road - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian who passes through the road in the middle of the night, as newspapers reported.
Last year, a police officer was released from the charges of killing the police after killing and killing a man on the A1 road near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
At the court, the victim at the age of 22 had been drinking alcohol and dropped on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to emergency calls - was in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on the Thursday incident occurring at Morges should sign up to the police at telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague within Prague Pride.
This was reported by the CEO of AČCKA Katerina Petříčová.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on 8 August, the festival approaches the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people participated in the event.
"Pracha is among the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises," Petrzyčeka said.
According to the survey, foreign visitors spend on the festival on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For travel, it is generally applicable that LGBT customers are very lucrative, they are interested in staying in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and spending more than others," Petrzyčka said.
The first Pride Tourism Sympozium will be held this year as part of the festival program.
It is conducted by LGBT tourism experts from Europe, the United States and China.
The festival will continue until Sunday, August 14.
This year’s main theme is love, but the action will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, prevention of AIDS and transgender issues.
The top of the festival will be a traditional guide on Saturday with alegorical cars, which will leave the Václavsky Square to the Summer.
This year, thousands of people took part in the lead, worshiped a minute of silence of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orland, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate forty years.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end up in a disaster, have enjoyed small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series of director Lubomir Benes was premiere on August 12, 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which is now known by viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, the drawings of the designer and director Lubomíra Benes were drawn, which he invented for the magazine with two boxes of Lord Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš later invited to collaborate with the dramaturg of Jiří Kubič and the designer Vladimir Jiránka and together created a film by the Kutyans.
Today, with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio in 1979, a series for Slovakia TV began in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then received in 1985, and this time it was already played directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Benez founded his own animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Curychu, where other pieces were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of which took part in Beneš's son Marek.
There are currently more than ninety episodes with the stories of these knitles, which all fall under the hands, but never breaks on themselves, and are always filled with optimism, ideas and knitl enthusiasm, and are finally satisfied with their work, showing a well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatre, and characters or other toys with Pata and Mata displaying are the hit of each toy.
The story for Fiji and two-year-old harmony.
At the end of the week, we have chosen one of your sports and one of your lives.
They both have a good end.
Let's go and see.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has a identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the most things people spend on airports?
This is a Friday overview of the world’s websites.
The first medal of the Olympics.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The ragby selection of this continent was defeated in the final of the Olympics of the seven-week ragby team.
This is the first medal that Fiji won for himself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal took sixty years since the first trip to the Olympics.
The Fiji trainer will have a great success.
Ironically, it is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been led since 2013 and after the finals, as if a British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play freely and easily and see if we'll be able to make the biggest match in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji finally dominated it sovereignly and a small country with 900 thousand inhabitants now experiences an Olympic story.
This was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new girlfriend and luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without hands and feet for 11 months.
A girl who looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," a two-year-old girl rejoiced as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes bridesmaids to swing hands and legs and then sitting together without proteases.
Harmony has been diagnosed with type B meningitis during a few years of life, doctors gave her only ten percent of the chances of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and never leaves her.
He's on the lookout.
I saw her showing herself to the other children with the words Hello, I am Harmonie and I have no hands, adds mother.
Look at the joy of the lady.
What do we spend most on the airport?
CNN makes the findings that people at airports most lose for packed water.
The Hudson’s travel essential stores has published data over the last year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most in their airport stores.
The water was sovereignly first.
Beverages were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the first ten.
Nineteenth place planted a large package of M&M coconut bovines.
And can you determine who closes the first ten?
As one of the above things you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Veslarian sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly ruled the category of twins without a cowboy for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Riu de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the uncomfortable couple moved to the smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics, and since 2009.
In the lagoon of Rodriga de Freitase, they scored 69th win in the series in the final of Thursday.
What are we different from the others?
We are just more beautiful, Murray joked already during the Olympics when he had to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we do nothing different than others.
We train hard, very hard.
And we’re constantly trying to improve our technique, that’s our philosophy,” Murray said more seriously.
Their control is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-meter and stokyl chassis, academically viewing Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond is studying and focusing on finance, Murray, for example, has a charity boxing game behind him.
That’s why they don’t spend a lot of time together outside the dishes.
Eric gets into the ship basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be damaged, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference seemed to be the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He always responded as the first and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
But on the water, the rivals are destroyed with a quiet force.
They go their pace, and although they are often not in front of the middle of the trail yet, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We run on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre.
We're just trying to get a pace that nobody else can do.
We know what we need to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old younger partner, he won seven gold medals for the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007 when both members of the golden four were without a cowboy.
Just after the unexpected failure, large crews at the Beijing Olympics decided to move on to a twin without a cowboy.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat of their career was held and the dominance confirmed in Riu.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be fucking hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, said Murray.
We know we all want to throw us out of the throne.
We've always got that shirt on the back.
We are trying to be a half step in front of everyone, he added.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once populated.
Scientists at Goddard’s NASA Space Study Institute have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2, could govern similar conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low speed of rotation of Venus can be explained in its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus once could be proud of a rare atmosphere similar to the Earth, while slowly rotating.
The model also addressed the previous topography of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to rule over it and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
The Venus used the sun, which was 30% worse.
"In simulation of the GISS Venush model during a slow turning, it displays its daily side to the sun for almost two months at once," said Anthony Del Genio, a GISS scientist in a new report.
This is how the surface is heated and the formation of rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like a rainbow and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
As a result, it is temperate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model composed the story of Venus a similar evolution that was previously hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus has probably been inhabited in the past -- over a few billion years -- has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans were evaporated and water vapors were burned with ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped and remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal effect of greenhouse gas -- it is Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche team coach
Patrick Roy resigned to his post as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, as a reason for making it impossible to participate in the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice-President/Manager-General of Colorada Joe Sakic confirmed the step and stated that the club will immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been a coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche’s hockey operations, with energy, passion and commitment,” Roy, a 50-year-old, said in a statement.
For a long and intense time, I have been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of the hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also have the opportunity to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, whom Roye accepted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his benefits to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him a lot of luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best coach of the league during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
The team has won 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado has struggled with Minnesota in the first play-off cycle, and in the last two years he hasn't always played after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to get the second wild card at the Western Conference.
The Roy band, who signed up in China, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadians and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on the oil plate in the North Sea rebuild conversations and interrupted stagnation
The top representatives of the parties stated that wages for oil workers in the North Sea were suspended, while all parties to the dispute went to a new negotiation bike.
The Wood Group has sporadicly held bets against the oil field service company in the North Sea, which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Union Union and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to resolve current disasters," the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of meetings throughout the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from the new corners.
According to trade organizations, their recent events, which were the first in more than 25 years, were up to 30% protest against wages.
Wood Group lowered prices this year and paid approximately 9 percent less to its suppliers in the North Sea due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rates are reduced by 10 per cent for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide companies with space to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its paying lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries for modernization of its processes – immediately after a mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the UK’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Dave Anderson, a Scottish parliamentary member, met with trade unions at the beginning of this week to negotiate one of the largest labour events of the entire generation that led to a breakdown in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for everyone, not only for some,” he said.
For comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to invest in new projects in the North Sea, while the average in the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotating stars in Plejadas
The latest mission of Kepler’s cosmic telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speeds of rotating stars from the Plejada Starscope.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the stars run at different speeds, and how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups, we will learn more about the relationship between the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Plejada star is located in 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the collection are now reaching the state of adulthood and have emerged for about 125 million years.
Now it's turning the fastest.
At instant maximum speeds, these teen stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the ageing of the star, the speed of rotation is slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotating each star by measuring the time between the discovery of discernible points on the stars -- similar to sunlights.
According to the latest data on speeds of rotation, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, they make pyramids slower than you are smaller.
"In the ballet, Plejád sees that slower stars are more massive, while those that turn faster are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Plejád Starscope is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
"Pleaders provide us a key to the theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There is still a lot that we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow their rotation speed, saying, “They will put their dance shoes on a row.”
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of the speed of the Plejád rotation in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and I could go to another hospital after a few months?
Is it possible to work without entry into specialization after graduation?
It is about me that in the field I would like to work, I now have a free job only in a slightly distant hospital, but in about half a month I could have a place to work elsewhere I would like to work.
I don’t know how to deal with the situation about that six months, the question continues.
Answers Mr. Lenka Wolf.
No law provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the labour law and may be concluded between an employer and an employer in order to ensure the refund of the expenditure expenditure associated with an increase or deepening the qualification of an employee.
There is a long-term pressure on the non-concluding of these agreements with regard to ensuring the mobility of healthcare workers and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004, on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the exercise of a medical profession by a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, while expressly the participation in specialized education is considered to be deepened by qualifications (not to increase it).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75 000 CZK.
No law or obligation to register in special education.
The law only provides the conditions for application for enrolment in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is entitled to carry out a doctor’s profession already due to the completion of the necessary university study, even if under the law prescribed conditions (under professional supervision of a doctor specialized in the relevant field).
The law provides a situation where professional practices undertaken in other fields of specialization may be calculated in the specialising of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the pocket.
However, since I don’t know the closer circumstances of this case, it can be recommended to consult the competent committee of the Ministry of Health (the Committee of Science and Medical Care), as the Ministry of Health by law provides an advisory and advisory service relating to the inclusion and its course in special education.
The Czech Medical Chamber also provides the advisory service for free, whose member every doctor must be.
Doctors from the Syrian Halaba ask for US intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to stop the dressing (the rebel parts of the city by the government army) and did not take advantage of its influence to advocate civilian protection, cited the White House letter by the AFP.
"We don't need tears, compassions, or even prayers, but we're desperate to create an eastern Halab-free zone to stop the attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, supporting the army of faithful President Bashar Assad, have announced that from today they will stop strikes in Halab to three hours each day to enable a safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12 a.m., all military activities, air strikes and firearms are to be stopped.
Stephen O'Brien, head of UN humanitarian operations, welcomed it, but stressed the need for at least two days.
According to AFP, 15 out of 35 physicians who operate in eastern Halab have already been controlled by rebels.
It says that during the five-year-old war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and observes how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent proposals for the evacuation of the Syrian regime and Russia sound just like slightly intimidated threats, undergone pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said 42 attacks were reported over the past month on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of which were reported on hospitals in which they were working.
We are most sad to decide who will live and who will die.
At an emergency, little children with such serious injuries are coming to us that we have to choose among them who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, doctors said.
Two weeks ago, four newborns dropped when the explosion stopped supplying oxygen to their incubators.
They laughed after breath and then their life ended - before they could actually start, they recalled.
The loyal army to President Bashar Assad, supported by Russian forces, surrounded the rebels by the controlled eastern part of Halab in the past weeks, inside, more than 200,000 people were found without food supplies.
The rebels under the ongoing strikes of Russian and Syrian airplane were able to break down and launch an anti-defense round on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides arrived in the city and its surroundings.
