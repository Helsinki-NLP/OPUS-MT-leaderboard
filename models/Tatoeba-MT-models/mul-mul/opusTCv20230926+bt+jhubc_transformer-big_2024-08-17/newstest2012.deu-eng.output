No release novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament refused today the request to revoke the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned in the framework of a novel of the Criminal Code.
The new arrangement, which could have embraced the way for the detained express minister, rejected the deputies in the second reading of the application to mitigate the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in jail in October for the conclusion of a allegedly harmful contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet lawful, the appeal of the convicted will be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko himself referred to the judgment as a political vengeance of the regime, and also in the West, the trial led to the suspicion of the court's pre-eminence.
The application, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted to remove the Criminal Code, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been required for his adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan Liberation Fight or the Libyan Rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winner must be defined.
As usual, this region wins in the elections Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council was known for the customary law of the Scharī ́ ́ ́ ́a, from which we now have a certain idea with God.
Libya would be the country without crime, because for thieves, you will shortly hack your hand.
Women should also forget about the thoughts of emanzipation as soon as possible, the potential believers are being condemned, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be assembled from mutual conflicting tribes in the future from the Qur’an.
In short - in Libya, an order will rule, which would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable.
Our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively not the best, and variation would hardly match the mentioned Libyans.
As seen, it is rather incredible that the Muslim fighters were allowed to help the unbelievers.
Their apologies may serve only the fact that the air attacks of NATO were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose all-power was praised after any successful encounter.
The winner in Libya? The west does not belong to it.
We only participated in a shooting change, serving the interests of Islam and our politicians deprived themselves of the dictatorship of a political allied, without any benefit.
Following the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we would rather take a look at a military occupation of Libya.
This means that those who are hired are a concern, namely, the departure of the cruise drivers.
But do mineral oil companies also get black gold at the spot price without occupation?
It is hardly possible for the West to finally boast about human rights with the right of its selfishness.
If this does not destroy the Shari`a`s representatives.
Beginning of a New Age of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe focused on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm came across Europe.
Each country published its GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the predecessor, Germany and France.
Today, however, the Obligation Market breaks all records.
Investors keep not only Greece in mind, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical officials of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, which is from France by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter, where Germany recorded a higher growth than was initially expected (growth by 0.3% instead of predicting 0.1%), while France sparked a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data only talked about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the predecessor, the gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowing economic performance was confirmed.
Therefore, the results are worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to temporary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
Throughout the euro area and in the EU, the economy was increasing by 0.2 percent in the previous quarter, which corresponds to the expectations of analysts.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2% compared to last year.
The revenue from its 10-year debt decreased at 28.45%.
The returns of Italian and Spanish State bonds increased to their critical boundaries.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries begin to feel problems...
The return for Czech State Debt is less than 4%, even if the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, votes will be made by the ECB as the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they win 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football election has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed Czech port and a magnificent port of Petr Jiráček, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious predecessor from home game and will not be missing again in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed reporting.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also won thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro's 1:0 fairly happy, which has thus released its ticket for the football EM.
Also due to the precise defense game of the Czech team accounts, they put the Montenegrins more under pressure only in the second half.
The pech birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which lost two huge chances.
Also, thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed next year with the European Championships, and it is also delightful that the domestic football will add a prize of about 200 million.
From the first few minutes, a fairly fighter football was played.
Both teams combined long and thus played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home crew remained, and the wide defeats before the straf were successfully denied by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for the core program of their country.
They made a living shield.
Several hundred high school students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country against a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced the US and Israel death.
A few hundred students from the University of Iran in Isfahan formed a lively shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
They wanted to know that they are ready to protect the core program of their country if necessary with their own lives.
The International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seemed to have not abandoned its efforts for a nuclear weapon for a long time.
Israel also talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear power plants.
Students prayed in the afternoon before entering the complex and then announced the death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack that was intended to put the Iranian nuclear program largely out, the Israeli press said it would also be the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan’s target, from the center of Isfahan.
The food card of a fat-saturated child: It doesn't eat breakfast and eat for evening bread root
More than one-third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys have shown that obese children are usually from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
So once again it shows how important the environment is for a person’s healthy development, in which he grows, and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, root plants are up to half more common on the table than in families in which children with normal weight live.
More than 19 percent of children with overweight had potatoes for evening bread on the day of the announcement under the motto “Adipositas is no accident.”
In families with thicknesses, sport is not just one of the favorite jobs, but it concerns the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents are at least once a week time for active exercise.
Surveys under 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a random," supported by the General Hospital and Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of exercise in the family are critical factors responsible for the fearfully increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“Only half of the children responded, for example, five times a day, eating breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-end bread - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worm for evening bread
Experts point out that even relative minorities, such as family regular breakfast, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of students have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast for themselves.
The worst was the finding that it wasn’t eaten in every 10 family at all.
Breakfast is considered the basis of a healthy daily diet.
The survey proved, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, people consume much more unhealthy apples.
And almost everyone – without regard to weight – drinks sweet lemons every day (70 per cent)
Although more than 40 per cent of children are performing sports, only less than half of their parents are doing this – that is, only 15 per cent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own meal plans according to appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children like between 12 and 15 in terms of diet is far from the ideal of healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meals, meat dishes and naturally sweet foods.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet lemons," the final report stresses this survey.
At lunch, that is, the main dish, the tears won just before the poultry.
The children almost didn't like this, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite ready to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of stakeholders who completed the questionnaire after completion of the clarifying presentation 'Adipositas is not random', in many cases a significant shift of preferences to the principles of healthy diet was recorded," the results of the project said.
This was, for example, in the sweet limous, where many children began to give the ordinary water the priority.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more frequently poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less nuts or sweet food.
A professional claims - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the initial article about how to learn stylists, I had a little taste that it was a little too much fabric for the beginning.
I didn’t know in the least what was going on.
Talks from three professionals from the industry, the dressing of problematic figures and a seminar on how it works "on the spot".
It's going to be even worse.
The closer the examination comes to us for more information and practical tasks.
However, even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still complete.
This time we discussed with director Alena (not one man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideal proportional figure.
And that’s most of us.
One has a too short neck, the other has a too young figure without regular curves, and again others are moulding.
It is the case of the stylist, large shoulders optically casting, extending the neck or highlighting the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with large bubbles, wide hips and narrow taille - beautiful and figurative beans without having to act too provocative.
For example, if the difference between tail and hips is so big that the rock or pants really don’t fit, you should at least cut a piece on a custom basis.
You will certainly not regret it, because good-seated clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a custom rock, you feel much better than in one of the straps that are always high and roasted in the tail, etc.
Young figures can, in turn, be allowed to wear clothes with sleeves, construction, applications, stickers or refinement.
With this lot of information and figure types, I’m happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid that, in view of the house task, it's almost not to be done.
Each of the participants of the course received a promi for which they should invent appropriate outfits - daily clothing and dinner clothing.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "attract Miranda Kerr" you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than for Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably recently increased to the hundred pounds (a little overwhelming), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothes from magazines or search, print, and then edit graphics on the internet.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, we will then express our entirely personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphical side of the style.
The stylist attracts the models not only purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete presentation, e.g. trend handbags, pants, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that's only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was equivalent to three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And an inclined stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.
The magical word is variable.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the jeans, such as a t-shirt or a shirt, but you can wear it on the naked body, wear it shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to climb the sleeves or screws up and the whole look looks quite different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But most of all, I found the following advice: “You first need to know the rules perfectly.”
“Then you need to hurt them,” said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we have to break all these lessons, what can be combined with something, and why, even if you often get to see quite different in fashion journals.
Quiet from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist has to have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you must be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
With all of this, you need to consider the design of the outfit.
That image and style are sometimes half of success, which Jan Pokorný confirmed.
You just need Madonna to look at an unjustly brilliant singer from the image and marketing made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Also known personalities often consider this to be thrown out of money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I look like, is second-range).
And if someone of us already becomes styled, then we should expect that he or she will likely force us to a very different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you just need to google to be sure that the boulevard press writes the corresponding promi back or down, etc.
Jan and Mario put us in the heart on Sunday, not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then the outfit to "build together".
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he stylizes and he must be a more profound psychologist.
People estimate without providing themselves and stand in their opinion.
"If a manager orders us to see her closet and complement beautiful pieces, then we can't clear the entire closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
“You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to which you recommend what you can wear,” Mario says.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called “plate bag” must include.
So a pocket that you can push on the tail and wear all the necessary properties with you.
Except for clear things such as sharks, abrollers for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains tools such as a nylon fitting (to help the stylist in photographing products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are raped backwards, if they are not too large, and, of course, underneath the cloth or other cloth.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
Also when photographing in the workshop, where the floor is right, you can damage the shoe soil, screwed out.
We've been hanging and hanging...
With the shear, you should not even touch the shoes so that you don’t hurt them.
So you really have to do it sent.
Mario pleased me by praising my "creation" without limitations.
The above skill is not just my strength.
All this was just the breakthrough of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting yourself to styling at professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Revision
Originally careless ride becomes completely avoidable through a series of diletant errors for routine ride to early layer.
Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions in a large part, what is useful if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Before he arrived on the table, the new piece with the subtitle "The Run" awakened high expectations.
However, he promised that the old-fashioned game series "Need for Speed" would move a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the embedded passages appear, in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and goes on foot.
But as it is used to NFS, it is very different in the end than you expected.
Certainly - it is potentially fairly decent arcade racing, but in general the game is confused by some excessive errors that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a principle incomprehensible fault of gambling developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time, you will be introduced into history, the main character of which Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task to be the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole set of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different route and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression that the game would offer the same again.
Some environments are still quite beautiful, although the technical level of graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
Nothing that moves the world.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or above by deep snow landscape seemed visually very pleasant.
Sometimes, untypical elements bring a bit of variation in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert tower that restricts the vision.
In the mountains, you need to be careful so that you don’t get rid of a lawn.
In addition, the individual races are quite well built behind each other.
Just a few, but they are enough.
For a while, you try to overcome the required number of opponents (in principle a classic racing), then you have time to overcome (classical racing against the stop-up), then you expect another personal duel with a single contractor.
The police are also involved, who wants to make the whole thing.
A news is passing in which Jack leaves the car.
It’s more about some interactive animations where Jack runs from someone else and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (concretely only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous because at least this element has no chance to be boring - it is one of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, although it does not break out trees, on the other hand, it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations must look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will still be fair for this model, although you could find better in competition.
So far, everything is in the best order.
Real problems emerge only after some time.
Unlike driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually before no blow on any object you know how the car behaves, then it is obviously not all right.
Typical example: When you cross narrow cars or walk in front of the cars, you just "strive" the other cars in some places easily, in other, almost identical situations, but you get into the slider and turn wild pyropets.
Or the car goes straight to the shrott.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn’t matter, but it’s always upset.
The restarts are thus resolved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then one throws the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you use it, everything goes out of the front.
The restarts are therefore rather such as a tool, in the event that something fails, but you shouldn’t leave it.
But sometimes it doesn’t even help restart, there’s nothing else than learning the critical section from the head.
It is uncomfortable that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves must be passed in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don’t fit through.
Otherwise, "civil" cars are always in the same configuration, whether they come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see the contractor passing through two cars playing against you, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to turn them around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed so that it always comes close to your nose.
The contractors have further advantages.
In the whole game, there are a few places where you are always overcome at the same place by the same opponent and here again without regard to the time.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that happens in the opposite direction.
The contractor has to overcome a devil coming out here.
And if he’s already before one, then he’s going to take a look of course, so you’ll be driving your own car there a few times at the beginning.
Clear - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a bad thing, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is totally fairly fun and, in fact, also loaded so that you almost don’t know where one of the heads is.
And, in principle, it doesn’t matter what “fault” is – the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the race in a way that no long-sufficiency can occur, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You should not ignore the benchmarks on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for urban areas, the strong American limousine for straight motorways and exotic super-sport cars for technical rides, for example, on the Serpents in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (challenging) - so the race in the individual locations that you know from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for tasks (challenging) and history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the online Autolog feature, which compares, among other things, its own achieved results with those of other players and provides additional collective features.
One of the other incomprehensible cuts is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you arrive in a subway tunnel (in the dark) where you ride along the rail (in the dark).
On the tacho, figures range from 150 to 200 km/h, but there comes from behind a subway and drives a compromiseless to scratch.
In our editorial we’ll probably have a long time to argue about whether this was a blackout of the game age or whether the authors think we’re so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases quite attractive and here and there even brilliant.
The more angry it is that in some exciting moments, the frequency of image repetition becomes slower and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns particularly the accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound reproduction is as far as O.K. and the soundtrack is taste sack.
In an effort to address as wide as possible scale rather young audiences, a soundtrack a la created "of anything" - but who already buys such a game because of music?
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be confused by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we would have been able to claim with the breast tone of the belief that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that’s how the game seems unfinished.
A good pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to put these mistakes into the eyes of one with the power of airport lights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance between the individual institutions sensitively out of the lot."
I wouldn’t expect such a hard war to be burned.”
“It will take five to six years until the waves are overwhelmed and all are used to their new role,” Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, began to sharply speak at the Legal Faculty.
How seriously she takes the motto "comprehensible and openly over Europe", she has already shown in the first part of her speech, in which she has managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a way that she could have been so invisible and understandable that some of the teachers of the Faculty of Law of the University of Karl.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, it became critical that he was too urgent - a gray official who has not grown such a role, but I have to say, it has pushed all the breath, how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a man who makes it complete to listen patiently to twenty-seven Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained her as a response to the question: "Who is this - the European Union? What number should I call?", which is an important step towards the agreement and better readiness of EU policy to countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our oil owners Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda under which the European Union lived, lives and is intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency was described as a big negative result that has seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all hands to do.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only to the presidency, but also to the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome to this day.
And there is still a need to approve the seven-year EU budget, which makes the matter much more complicated just due to today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a slight and saving budget, which sectors will prioritize, which countries will be more and which countries will be less promoted - all this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also reminds her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "comprehensiblely about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are glorious shortcuts, strange words, and expertjargons that no one understands.
As a citizen, how do I really know if you really think about crumbs or rounds in Brussels and different large bananas, or if someone really wants to prohibit the quartz from us?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are in reputation to be Eurosceptics who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The more embarrassed is the weak representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors in this, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters, and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
“Believe me, if a Polish or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovakian is nearby, then the French says next to me, “Hey, what are you putting your heads together – is this your V4 again?” and it makes a pretty acidic mine.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future the EU is expecting tough rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As a much more realistic than a "European Federation" it considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have the countries of the euro area and the countries outside the euro area.
“We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that only the countries who want it should work together and those who do not want it should be quiet.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately goes beyond a strong "Europe of the Different Speeds"," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, according to all the issues that have an impact on the EU, and not only on the Eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM comes into the second century of its existence
If you were looking for an appropriate word that IBM’s strategy was most accurately characterized, then it would be the word “longevity”.
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, although it is known as a modern company since its founding has passed a century.
The basis for this longevity was her first boss – visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
He already represented the slogan, many global problems could easily be solved if people were ready to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became a brand mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time as the title of the company's internal magazine, which began to be released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to its principles and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business, and society over the course of our first century.
We hope that we will achieve more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today’s company’s director on the occasion of the Jubilee.
Thinking System
In the 1930s, Watson operated social care for his employees - in the same way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid a vacation as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a thoughtful salary system for best newers.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are also highlighted.
The company has been a great deal in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world - and has been able to choose any IBM discrimination.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is also to replace the palmier at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been at IBM for thirty years, so far it has taken the position of the Vetriebs, Marketing and Strategic Chief.
IBM has made so-called online storms in recent years, many of which have grown up future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Your unprecedented position in the business guarantees a strong image to the company, both inside and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had rather the concept of an institution than just a technology company," said Economist, professor at Harvard Business School and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," George Colony, a member of Forrester Research, added.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product width – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most famous inventions include banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code, or diskette.
With approximately $220 billion in exchange value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second-largest technology company (equivalent to Apple), with Microsoft overriding for the first time since 1996.
The view in advance
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers – unfortunately, for example, the attempt was with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or even the computer IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on advanced movement, so you should not be emotionally bound to the past,” Samuel J. Palmisano said.
Therefore, IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike Microsoft’s counterparty, which is in principle standing and falling with its Windows operating system.
Promised technologies
In IBM’s gains, most of the services, software and hardware are involved in a fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware with more than fifty percentage was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-based assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-driven technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis for the first time fell as a storm over the world.
Also here, IBM remained faithful to the possession of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the middle of the major global economic crisis.
So far, the company IBM seems to be beyond the current crisis without any damage.
The value of IBM shares has risen by missiles by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s net profits are constantly growing.
IBM’s business slogan is: everything can change – only the values are not.
That is why this flexible giant can also be expected to overcome the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to space flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded 100 years ago in New York had initially a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM only in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a establishment in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later society, IBM put the merger of four companies whose history returned to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous sticker clock to register the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the chief of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him in the management of the company.
This leader then even put IBM’s founders in the shadows – based on Watson’s ideas to date, the company’s invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already said, began with the manufacture and distribution of all possible machines for trade – from wheat and cheese cutters to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled his revenues to nine million dollars and the company expanded on all continents.
Watson was so essential for the company that he was sitting in the headquarters for forty years, only then he was dismissed by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s technicians and computers helped NASA’s flights to all – to Merkur and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that set the computer standard at that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it purchased the consulting share of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the high-value consulting services and services business.
The strategy that IBM has paid out in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It involves the intention to use technologies wisely in areas that have not even been planned, for example, to improve the situation in traffic and urban administration.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the Smart Commerce platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Since 1932, IBM founded a establishment in the Czechoslovakia at that time - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central Central and Eastern Europe is seated in Prague and there is also a top team of world-class researchers dealing with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful cats:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey for yourself, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became their lovers from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained hoping that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Bartošová had ordered shelter in her own house, she would probably not even have fallen into a dream of how this goes out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to Říčany after thirty days on her urgency, Joseph went with her.
He even knew publicly that he loved them.
With time Darina resigned, it even seemed to be like she wanted to reconcile her unfaithful husband again - but now she finally gave him the race pass.
It doesn't matter who his wife sleeps with.
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will surely receive unofficial poor people at home.
He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not go beyond him.
"But not as a beloved, deceased old ass, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," said Ms. Rychtářová; but she also said she has already been emotionally separated from him and remains alone on mutual independence.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him so far is worthy of Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
“I stay with Iveta, nothing changes.”
"My wife wants a paper egg and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"With Darina, I'm normal, but we don't just share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the blade) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn’t want to stop them.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care whether she has a friend or who it is.
I understand that this is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and therefore I assume any responsibility.
The worst women's disobedience: What's up with you?
If you call men to call some typical female iniquities, then they exclude them from the sleeves some promptly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we let a few unsettled revues pass again that let men wallow the blood into the veins?
Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping Shopping
Do you give them a chance to be merchant?
Do you need to buy at least one hammer per week?
Would you like to go shopping and can it be a little bit more in stock?
Then, in your case, it is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desires under control halfway.
But hand on the heart, what woman is already waiting for looking for a well-seated top dress just so to bump through a dress shop and not just try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Just think about how often they said to her husband - if you stay outside...
Continuous dissatisfaction
“Am I not too thick?”
“I have to lose at least five pounds – should I start yoga or gym?”
"Do you like me at all?"
Is it known to them somehow?
Oh, yeah?
Then you may also belong to women who are regularly occupied with how they look.
This doesn’t mean you have to leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife is constantly worried about their appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Ordinance and cleanliness in the first place
It's a fight against wind moulding.
Wash windows, wash sheets and dust, shake the bath - and this at least twice a week.
Swimming with her partner because he jumps again with dirty shoes onto the clean plates, you care about the children because the newly distracted washing basin is already dirty again and because the glass door in the living room wardrobe has already again fingerprints, but where polaring makes so much effort?
If you suffer under this type of "deviance", then you should know that nothing should be overwhelmed and that order and cleanliness in family life are not at first.
This scale of cleanliness can eventually also harm the mutual relationships and especially the rest of the family.
Sticheln
"Great turnouts come into the washing basket."
“Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?”
“A wet towel is not just throwing on the floor.”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, that is not bad, but they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to make so much.
Clitch and clitch
Some women like to climb and dance, then they are stuck behind their backs or even deceived, or they are deceived by alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to joke through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, every woman has a slightly harmless crap and crap in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with the roughest calibers, to which nothing and no one is holy, who may deny everyone in their surroundings and which pose a significant danger especially for women’s collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Tower Jaromír Jágr had a large portion in the NHL match with two assistants in the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, and thus is again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the overview of the ninety-nine-year-old Eishockey star was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed that after the game, Giroux prophesied a great night.
"So before the game, I'll tell him that he has succeeded in a hatch today."
I felt that somehow.”
"He's always getting a feeling like that," Jágr explained, after which Giroux made a door at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trace".
Voráček fought the puck behind the hurricane gates and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the abpfiff of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he achieved his third hit, afterwards Wayne Simmonds led his shooting to the fourth gate.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the best three," Jágr said.
"I wouldn't like to play with such an eishockey player at the end of my career like him."
"I'm very happy."
"I cut my game on me."
“All the years in the NHL, my co-players played their game on me, and now the spice is turning around,” Jagr.
Carolina made the game again a drama - by the strike of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who passed out of a punishment, came to a door.
But Matt Read prevented any further complications in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellent Pronger acted still in our zone."
"He knocked the puck, I took the ride up and (Read) went to the farther fosts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it has succeeded," Voráček described the last hit of the party from his view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia was at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and died in the second third due to a injury to the upper body.
In addition to Beck's experienced leadership, the Candians were a lost in Penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points painted the coach of the home team for the high disease-related failure in the defense – the game was only playing with five defenders.
"It's bad."
“The meeting we played with only one experienced player, the rest were young players.”
“But nothing can be done there, we need to finish it,” said Jacques Martin.
"When we changed a wave of attack after the other, we had nothing to oppose."
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here,” said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Ondrzej Pavelec, the Czech gatekeeper, shot thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which thus ended a series of five defeats, had five different shields.
Change of travel prices since 1989
By 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Car Tourist.
At that time, travel agencies sold only travels to the Socialist East Block countries, and only chosen ones were in the West.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was from 1962 to 1972, when you were able to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a prowest course, and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed to travel citizens of the Eastern Block (as well as the Czechoslovakians) freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the Czech Republic wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
At the time, travel agencies also offered travel to the West, but then you had to buy huge snakes or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, the thing hasn't been running for a long time.
The so-called currencies - the condition for a departure to the West - were granted only "political-reliable" people - who couldn't even travel.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, therefore it would have been impossible to launch the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Therefore, most Czechs spent their holidays in the countryside, it is no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that lasts to this day.
The present revolution of 1989 followed a Czech travel revolution on foot.
While until 1989 a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million foreign vacations in countries around the world.
An immense paradox of which you are no longer aware today is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular Czech holiday country by 1989, Croatia as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
From the early 90s of the past century, the currency obligation was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which encouraged a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaki couldn’t get enough from their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
This is how the Czech holidaymakers slept when traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension at that time.
A typical feature in travelling abroad from Czechoslovakia at the time was a packaged luggage room with conserves, beer and permanent reservoirs, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could finally freely purchase the Western currency.
Our level of life and thus the average wages increased, which emphasized a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began regularly preparing charter flights to 1997, making the flight trips incredibly valid compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already made money-free payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, which made traveling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the “post-total” travel came in 2000, when the high demand for the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers are flying every year into far-reaching sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries annually!
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitely ranked our country among the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in their history, they offered for a single holiday, including the cost of more than 15 CZK per capita.
The main assembly is to find a new president - again a pact threatens.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been president and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek will not be known at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general assembly in Nymburk on Thursday.
So far, there is no agreement on which election order is to be elected.
Without this, there is no vote on the three potential followers at all.
Three players want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his role, as he had urged his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old crossings between the two alliance chambers re-broken, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had arrived at the peoples house in Prague district Smíchov for free, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not just about the election itself.
It could not even be agreed on who is actually voting entitled at the plenary assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with a full power.
At least partly, there was an agreement at this point, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute of State and Justice, whose view was that a representation on the basis of power was not held.
However, the disputes about the election order continue to continue.
The Executive Committee also made no more clarity in the matter, in which its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else is at the agenda.
Although the views of the election have changed a few times, the neurological point remained the same.
The question is, how to act in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The dispute point concerns whether to deal in accordance with the statute or whether a completely different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is candidate.
Mahren is allegedly willing to take part in the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both Chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, depends on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
“The two preroads have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two-chamber concept,” Svoboda understands the objections of the Mexican side, which best finds it not to add the election order, but to choose according to a valid statute.
Tomáš Paclík is also surprised to agree, even though it is noted that the statutory election order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My desire is to be elected as far as possible according to the statute."
"In order that no insightful replacement variants may be invented, as at the last main assembly," said the owner of the football club, Victoria Plzeň, who for the first time nominated and limited himself to Pelta in his opinions.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the EM football today would certainly contribute to the calmness of the fans."
“When football only rides on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater,” says Jablonec’s official, who brings the greatest experience from all three addicts, and this is both professional and regional.
Rajchl is still there.
“I hope to have a deal, but the situation is unfortunately duplicate.”
“It’s not a matter between people of burdens and martyrs, but there are some efforts to “justify” the regulations for their own purposes.”
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the main assembly is not excluded."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally wins," Rajchl said.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague due to a technical disturbance, so you were looking for a replacement variant, as to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the Barrage Ink Stadium.
Finally, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial to which it is supposed to be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of School Affairs, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the split parties within the country’s largest sport association to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state contributions, the trustworthiness of the Czech football and also the upcoming Chief Assembly of the ČSTV, to show the new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the president because he does not see the right candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the Chief of the Pilsner Footballers, had been able to make a strong candidate before the extraordinary General Assembly, who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new President of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have committed himself to the struggle for this top position.
"If there was a good applicant, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an addict," Paclík ČTK said.
The main reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the role of the Chairman only one year, i.e. by 2013 until the date of the ordinary General Assembly.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too much in the football scene.
“I personally spoke to some of the people in question.”
“I can believe that some people told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"That kind of view would have changed," he continued.
Most of all, Paclík is allegedly disturbed the connection of Pelta with the President of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation that is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the cults, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable that Pelta should have the position of the chairman.
"When he wins, the state of today would be preserved, and in Czech football it would not go ahead at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, fights football twice badly," Paclík stressed.
He also argues that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearings to be investigated in a corruption case, but the Pelta emphasized penalty.
“I don’t know which prestige should bring a Pelta victory to the so-called football.”
"And how would we stand there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes president," but he already sees a little less.
If Paclík wins in the Donnerstag game, however, he can imagine a future collaboration with Pelta.
Likewise, another candidate - Rajchl, who supported Paclík before the main assembly in October, ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to go to."
"He has great abilities."
“I could imagine him, for example, as the head of the national team.”
“But I don’t think he is able to lead the association as a manager.”
"I don't put my nose in matters I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had taken care of that he was at the top of the retreat of the Arbitration Commission with Luďěk Macela, replacing Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the association’s president growing up.
And focusing on his ability to manage private companies, since last summer, he has also been head of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated the first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which is unlikely in conflicting situations," Paclík led, who does not deny his antipathy, for example, against Sparta Chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby with the top politicians for more money flowing from the lottery tax into sport.
“This is one of the crucial things the new president should devote himself.”
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but then they also have to clip and say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not see Paclík as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the president of the FAČR must be "over-party".
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not just ideal."
“But in my opinion it doesn’t make much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner Club to a third party to return after a year and a half,” Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR that would exclude a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, promised he would make himself strong in the case of his election that the FAČR would receive new statutes that would exclude disputes about the election order in the future.
The official of Jablonec is confident before the negotiations in Nymburk on Thursday and believes that the election contest will surely be sharpened in the event of a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team in the case of his elections and the gain of funding.
Only at the last moment he decided to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, so he liked the two-month pause to help defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are intolerant and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“He feels it’s the highest time to be led by someone’s association, the man who is primarily connected to the Jablonecer Club, but also acted at Sparta for many years and in the Executive Committee.
He also thinks he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that he is responsible for today’s problems with the election the euphorie that ruled in times of Ivan Hašek.
“Ladies were approved at the General Assembly in June, which were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was just the revision of the main document of the Citizen Association that he used as a locking tool for the Delegates.
"If I become president, then I will personally accept it and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it does not."
“This is a principle without which he cannot be,” Pelta claimed.
He does not try to limit himself to his contractors.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognized for his legal education, and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be the first deputy.
Tomáš Paclík has not been attacked for a long time, leaving no dry threads on Pelta.
He has been moving in football for over a year and can already refer to some successes.”
"But his attacks were declining and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, many now doubt about his real character," Pelta addressed his contractor, who probably remains faithful to his declarations that he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest class to the national team.
And this should be the Czech football hanger.
“I would also try to end all affairs – from the Causa Bohemians to the posthalls of the corruption scandal last year.”
"I would just then fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," the sixty-six-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his input into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I should only have to get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervousness is understood.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming General Assembly, he believes the delegates are not going to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If it really is the only controversial point to choose in the third round, then we'll go on it."
"Football needs credibility, and it only wins back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected to be the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic on Thursday at the General Assembly, this would allege that many people in the association would replace the Laune.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to resolve the Bohemian case, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football, and otherwise to continue the work that previous president Ivan Hašek has started.
"As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national elections, professional football, to performance football for youth.”
“I don’t want to say that I want to do everything alone,” Rajchl said in a conversation with ČTK.
“I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area.”
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football can move forward in every segment with miles.”
Many wouldn’t just be disappointed because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they had to start working really hard now,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he has considered no longer to be candidate at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t throw me a knife between the legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation why he’s delayed.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because otherwise others would do it."
“It’s trust that you can’t play,” he said.
It is allegedly motivated him to continue the work he started with Hašek.
“In two years we have managed a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw it away.”
"There have been processes that may come into effect only in a few years, and I would just be upset to see someone stop," he said, expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
"Behind him are mostly people who would make football so that he would only be there for elected."
“I can’t say anything, but I’m not party.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone, because it’s going well for everyone and not just for the chosen,” Rajchl said.
He also opposes the claim that he is only a Czech president.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really have to do the best possible for mosquitoes."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moroccan part, whose winner will then rise each to the first league."
“Then it couldn’t happen that today only three Mauritius clubs are playing in the league, which is particularly a problem for the young players in Mauritius,” Rajchl says.
Now that the Chief of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the struggle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl does not trust to appreciate his chances of being elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to his deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also led to saving $100 million for unfair treaties, the agreement of television treaties and negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of not drawing the association on a single stretch.
While Pelta says, “he has been disqualified from firsthand to help the Czech football become new,” he believes the second rival – Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in the fungus in just one year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commission would obviously not change fundamentally."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bring things to his favor,” Rajchl judges his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Spring in the Blue
by Julia Stanek
Planning pools in Ufo-optic, Prunk pools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonders - and rest the tired legs in sprudel baths after a city tour or hiking.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder had been on a research trip over the past few years, one in her luggage could not be missing: her bathrobe.
Backlings lying on the water, she looked high in artificially designed cubes, she met swimmer marble pots waiting on her at the beach edge, and amazed acriibly restored youth style swimming halls.
I liked her a bathroom, she picked up flights in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder this way - and presents her now in her new book "Badefreuden": Folksschimhalls in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her "retour to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe": besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport, she doesn’t have much on the hat, Meder says - just in the water, it’s different.
It’s sad only that swim fans have to find themselves with blue cakes and chlorine tanks, while joggers can breathe in the disturbing smell of fifty forests or beat a joyful bird flatter in the park.
“I asked myself one day why swimming pools must actually always be so boring,” said the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
Platters in the jumping pool and etheric sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is therefore so large because all senses are used, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming halls can be a real eye mouse: "The state of a floor has a water surface in baths."
"She is transparent on the one hand, but on the other, she reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high clouds, colored cages, jumpbretters.
The small-format image band "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of knowledge about the architectural and cultural history of the historic Wellness Oases - but especially makes a wish to jump into the blue.
Remarkable exemplars discovered the pool collector Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, they found a nitrate-resistant water in an eagle of a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca, as well as a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Várális Termdöfür).
On the contrary, there are many heated free baths in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city in the eye from Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch driving on the ski track.
The most exceptional pool design is expected by swimming guests in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upwards open shells it vaporizes in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals rain into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every pool, the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell sweat, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba so strongly stirs up heat oil that is hardly believed to be landing in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water, which is almost black and whose sleeves stick to one of the skin as soon as you let go into the pool - a special wellness experience.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in looking for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbath in the Czech bathroom Luhatschowitz, she found a closed ground.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was now closed.
When Meder looked at the overwhelmed windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw grain growing between the sheets.
On the contrary, you have had a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have this bath already behind it; you can discover not only neoromanic elements from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Mauritius hall in the style of Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool bath of Iris Meder – and not just because it originates in the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge different building styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool appears to be just a side-by-side thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank Leaves to Light raw materials business
by Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor in the world.
In January, the boss will have consequences.
Hamburg
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn to speculate.
Two-thirds of the respondents require the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to leave this business because it aggravates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on the global raw materials exchanges raises prices - and therefore banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
However, at the moment, most experts agree that sugars have disconnected from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the charges and said no business is "worthy of putting the good reputation of the German Bank on the game."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group currently examines the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
Until the end of the year, the examination will be completed, and the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the German Bank, as well as a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank’s top will then inform the consequences it draws.
In the end, there could be a reduction in raw materials business, or even the complete reverse.
Ackermann Bast on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial industry: "The rising betting on food prices shows particularly drastic how unprecedented banks today harm the general benefit."
Ackermann is now the top bank lobbyist in the duty.
"The Deutsche Bank has to remove all investments from its portfolio, where money is spent on betting at food prices," Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hungry people or about the reputation of the German Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes at first glance surprisingly, but it is clear that the company’s chief wants to give a perfect picture a few months before he leaves the office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not move to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
With a deviation from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible injuries, he hardly needs to shake himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
Each second would cancel raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute surveyed on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
At once, 11 percent believes it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers investments in which food prices are added.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would, according to the survey, cancel all the facilities in which money flows into raw materials speculation.
43 percent would abstain from a bank like this, 49 percent said they would think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21th House in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Von Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stands empty and becomes awarded.
He is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When heated by modern post-war architecture, by clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is a marvellous and famous example.
Schwanzer’s pavillion was then awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its light and sliding steel glass construction.
To date, the construction is considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW Four-cylinder house plus a shoe-like accessory building in Munich, he finally became internationally renowned in 1973.
His temporary exhibition pavilion was set up in the Swiss World Exhibition at the Wiener Southbahnhof, rebuilt and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called.
But the building was neither spacious nor technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long as contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more has fallen down.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called "21th house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a lucky case in any respect.
Implemented the new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted art historian with an important career in youth, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum, and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, continued to use the rebuilding with politicians and monumental protectors.
In addition to present art, the works of Bildhauer Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same-named foundation, there should be a café and a book store, and a office house should be built for it.
strict supervision, small state
Krischanitz was the ideal occupation for the execution.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna was sensitively reconstructed and expanded and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University in Vienna and the pavillon was a “unheartedly important place” for him, where he had regarded the exhibitions “fast every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which was lost in his conversion to Vienna and his reuse to generosity and lightness.
There were much larger problems in the current construction: the building was "a energy slider," Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used glass fiber-intensive insulation glass and replaced the glass roof with special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbest-filled roofs have been sanated.
Two floors brought space for the new use, a cut light grain between house and street ensures lighting, a bridge leads to entry - nearly a new building, but still the lightweight swing pavilion.
The original outdoor doors have remained, the house has been deleted in the old red-brown ross-protected color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly as he was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small state.
"Often there was a material to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection officer," Krischanitz says, pointing to a rough floor on the bottom floor.
Despite all the challenges, problems and buildings, the building is flexible and easy to stay.
It was hard for the pavilion, "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "reveal a real consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because it has occurred a city-building accident: around the Swiss garden, the entirely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquarters", with offices and residential houses, is created.
And maybe another case of luck will happen: The 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the colleague Francesca of Habsburg has purchased the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and, as you can hear, negotiate with the city about a neighbouring location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plans Winter Crisis Package in Millions
The train has set out a crisis plan to prevent rail crashes in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related trail losses and delays, the Deutsche Bahn issued more than €70 million in a newspaper report this year.
The "Image" newspaper reported in advance, with reference to a group-intern crisis plan, that investments of around €300 million were expected by 2015.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees for snow removal on train stations and railroads to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free train staircases up to the start of operation and 90% of the operational changes within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, train chief Rüdiger Grube had warned about rail crashes and delays in this winter after a summit with government and industry.
Last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger traffic as it lacks reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
For years, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for an approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in delivering ICE trains.
The train has also created for years that it has to allow the ICE-trees to be tested much more frequently at the workshop after a ICE in Cologne’s main railway station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Million Penal in the United States
After the tumultue of boss Josef Ackermann, new Ungemach comes from the United States: the Deutsche Bank has to pay there a million fines.
As if the problems weren’t enough for the German Bank at home, the industry is now getting its past into the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in a comparison to resolve disputes over the pledge of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator of NCUA suggests a whole range of large banks to have deceived joint banks with false promises to purchase financial products; they would have lowered the risks.
Such papers are lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and banks are thrown into the depths.
"We are pleased that we could resolve the issue without having to appeal to the parties," a German bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank did not make any debts with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the return of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Federal Banks and jumps at Pleiten to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billions of damage.
The comparisons that are now closed are the first of its kind.
The regulator had also precluded other major banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The relevant mortgage papers are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are underlying home loans.
When the U.S. real estate blade broke out in 2007, this became a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the top of the financial crisis, the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers died.
Even though the events have been back for a few years, banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisors have filed innumerable complaints in order to obtain recall or claim errors.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaint.
It suggests 18 international large banks that two U.S. real estate funders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have overcome in mortgage transactions of about $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to make a complaint with the FHFA, which is about several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurters to be straight for "substantive losses" without mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as an inconsistent and declared to wish to resign.
Warren Buffett Increases 10 Billion at IBM
Financialguru Buffett invests strongly in IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always said not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies can only be badly predicted.
But now he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand a lot earlier that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for other companies’ IT departments.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a rider strike in the financial world.
Accordingly, the IT IBM can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett now reveals at U.S. CNBC that he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn’t known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management that even in the economic crisis had made good profits.
“You have done a great job,” Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been working on luxurious IT services such as data centers for a long time.
The over 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice, as well as powerful corporate calculators.
Buffett had previously been hired by technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett approached, for example, a freight rail, a lubricant manufacturer or machine farmer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns around 80 own subsidiaries and shares in a range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it to one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unfair sense of making money introduced him the top name "Orakel of Omaha".
According to the Buffett investment, IBM shares temporarily increased by a percentage.
Big Blue, as IBM also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
In Microsoft, Buffett said he didn’t want to enter.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is striking
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “blooded ideology” that is now alive.
The murder of eight Turkish people and a Greek small entrepreneur between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turkeys, there is a long-recognized spirit back: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right extremist background against Turkey.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never questioned.
However, the discovered right-wing network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are still unpredictable.
"Live the bloody ideology again?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the contrary, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the offenders should have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right radical soup.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded: she reminded the victims of racist violence on weekends with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned to celebrate the fifty-first anniversary of the German-Turkish advertising agreement.
In joyful colors, it was staged together - as a story of success.
Like an earfish as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany Gift to the Fifth" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of "Hürriyet" is also unable to draw this thoughtful connection.
"It starts to fuck," says the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people were killed who paid taxes and had made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Particularly critical is the practice of the police and their success later in the German Internet forums.
Why the German authorities are not much more likely to look for suspects in the right-wing circles, the authors are wondering.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared for drastic means: “If you continue to shine here, the migrants will remain nothing but self-defense and weapons.”
“This will be the best self-defense.”
"Depending on the goodness of clarification and the adequacy of punishment of the entire network, the inner peace in Germany depends very much," Selen writes.
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s were clear.
The photo of the brand ruins of Solingen is deeply enclosed in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a striking threat, and the Germans that misconfidence and distance can be spoken in right violence.
However, the attacks strengthened our feelings on the Turkish side.
Don’t repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time, mainly, the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent an accompanying telegram to the Turkish presidents, but was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the time, in his speech, as many expenses paid to the Turks.
Just as the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep many German Turks have been the lack of trust in the legal state since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive clarification and re-evaluation of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandinavian Bank of Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost failed to bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since been defeated from a crisis to the next.
Now a German is going to be judged.
Axel Weber hadn’t thought of it.
Following his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank’s top, it was announced in July that he would perform almost as spectacular new job in 2013: the Governing Council President of the Swiss Großbank UBS - an unexpected and luxurious career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would come completely differently.
A trader of UBS in London had rounded all the bank’s security systems and sold around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief Oswald Grübel, a famous banker not only in Switzerland, had to go.
UBS’s Chairman is also considered an attack - and all the questions: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been known that Weber may advise the bank in February 2012.
And he will assume the Chairman of the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it’s going to be hard.
He is not a banker, but a professor of economics and banknote, and he would certainly have had a time of resuming.
With a hit, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank" for a long time.
Because, on the one hand, the UBS is huge – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager – and has been scattered from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing like this seems to be the one that once so proud Swiss Bank saves.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the overwhelming and solid Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, she was awarded as an investment bank to the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
The first banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger, says: “My students have always introduced the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time.”
From today’s point of view, you ask yourself, “How could I be wrong?”
He was greatly wrong.
In 2007, it was for the first time that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally genius banker.
A few months later, they knew why he was gone.
The bank’s investment party had soaked with subprime papers and had to cancel billions.
In order to educate this, UBS announced an increase in capital amounts to say and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who, some of which had not been to the nose before: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so distorted that you didn’t even learn his name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, 2006, still the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS stood in view of its failed investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for ten billion problematic securities, the Swiss Covenant gave six billion francs for a forced debt on which it could become the bank's owner.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sheet was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“We couldn’t save the UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the United States and declared ready to disclose the data of wealthy customers who possibly had deposited taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions as well as a penal order.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped in the tax reduction.
At the same time, she lost something that her capital had ever been in competition for rich customers: the nimb of confusion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
Following the resignation of the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through defect speculations and in asset management through aid for tax reduction.
And just as it became a little calmer again, just as you thought, the UBS is going to come back to it now, then follow this unsuccessful trader story: one single trader paid 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was going on.
And it turns out that with risk management in investment banking, it is obviously still not possible.
"With the case Adoboli, it was necessary to note that risk control has changed too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich Bank.
The financial manager of a large German bank is also certain: “The UBS’s problem is that it does not control the risk.”
It was exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers long ago had come to become guards of the great wealth of the world: no too big risks, security for money for it - even beyond the Alpine Republic, would have been able to break the world.
The treasures of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unbelievable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS’s centre in Zurich still fits the climb of the Swiss private bank – it’s just a bit bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Zurich trainstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to the lake of Zurich, which is covered by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are stunning, the shops are one of the highest in Europe.
You can find jewelry like Tiffany's here between Swiss tradition shops like Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Berr.
The UBS’s receipt hall enters through a heavy rotary door.
Inside, the walls are marble-coated, there are thick leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large marker for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometime, or betrayed, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, but, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two big banks.
The UBS has grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the fisheries would also have spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And though, they have long adapted to the seats of the fishing axis."
In fact, it was the angelic investment banking that changed the UBS, first gave her high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes author Luka Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs, or around €45 billion, the politicians agreed to save the big bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How could it come to this?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was too large for the small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
This helped the two different UBS precursor banks complement themselves: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already stronger internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks were affordable to get a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intelligent, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who worked from the bank teacher to the top."
But Ospel finally relyed on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably committed a crucial mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Obviously, overwhelmingness came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the executive meetings at which Wuffli’s CEO repeatedly issued the same word: Goldman Sachs hit the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank on Earth.
She led the "League Tables", the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's why the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps were already happy with her.
In the currency trade and in stock trade, she played at the top.
However, corporate advisers who have been entrusted emphasized a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has shortages in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost it the existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and a fund funded before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and forwarded securities on American mortgage loans – but also maintained risks.
Even as other banks have long been looking for the rise.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
The Euphoria is so big, so deep.
One manager had to go after the other when the attempts to eliminate seemed to be more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS have become the headquarters and are waking up until now.
Anyone who runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has agreed to all the nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: ending investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
Even though the bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment banking is going to be sharp, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was in fact only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank surprisedly separated from predecessors.
In the meantime, he has committed himself: he is expected to conduct the UBS businesses permanently, the Zurich Bank reported on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
He stretchs 3500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What do you want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has already asked.
He said he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich for the first time.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe loads U.S. exchanges
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged U.S. investors to take over the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained intact.
The worried industrial production on the continent empowered the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in Keim.
The general relief of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be carried out.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass still had a half full gold last week, not a half empty – but now the problems were in the foreground again, Mark Luschini said by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the sales points.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values noted for trading closing with a minus of 0.6 percent at 12.078 points.

The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is committed to the end of the rise.
The companies produced 2% less in September than in the previous month, according to the Eurostat statistics.
“We are not an island, we are dependent,” said Steve Goldman from Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investing Warren Buffett just confirmed this caution: it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in an CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early from its point of view to invest in European public debt or banks.
Instead, Buffett dropped a decade of old principle over the crowds and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment in more than $10 billion in IBM supported the traditional company’s share rate and initially noted it nearly a percent higher against the trend in the trade course.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.

Intelligent branches spread in cities
Seed feathers are often considered to be "probable birds": however, from cities, the high-speed animals can no longer be displaced, experts say.
One likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: for centuries, rain belongs to the city’s image, but in many municipalities there are complaints of drought and noise of animals.
So far, a remedy against the "probleem birds" is not in sight.
Seeds are no longer getting out of the cities, experts said at the first wheat symposium in East Friends.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consult on possible ways.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectors also brought the problems in cities back to the agriculture of specially protected seeds: the chemical insertion in agriculture has increasingly destroyed the traditional living spaces.
The hunting, increasing construction and the case of typical brown trees made the birds life difficult.
The shells are under nature protection.
There are large colonies with more than 600 pairs, among other things in the west of the West, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen, and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project on mass killing of knives in the country circle for negative strike titles.
Critics had described the catching of animals in birds and killing with bubbles as particularly brutal.
"The normal departure, the depreciation, brings nothing," city and landscape planner Werner Klöver said.
In addition to spraying water or falling trees, it often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals soften, large colonies split up and spread to other places."
Violation can only be thought to be an exception to hospitals, age homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t get them away anymore.”
Without the country, the problem should not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is thought to be a combination of crumbs of animals from sensitive residential areas and locks to resettle them elsewhere.
"Infotafels instead of chain seeds" said the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different deal with the animals: "A pickle in the face we can finally tolerate best self-confidence."
Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein had co-foundered the Ascheberger Krähen-Learstrada, in which the reference pictures of the life of the hochin intelligent seeds were informed.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: “There is a lot of communication that has a lot to say to one another.”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds do not only use tools to get to a taste, but even produce their tool as a tool.
Behaviour researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seeds, how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In a experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to take a rush with stones to reach a mottenlarve.
Without a lot of training, they realized objectively what size and shape a stone needs to have to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the pfiffing racks then had to solve a more kniffling problem.
In a cylinder set right, the researchers had placed a small embroidery with a motelarve.
With the snake, the birds were unable to reach their beasts.
However, the researchers had put them wire pieces.
From this all four animals formed a hole, with the help of which they then pulled out of the tube the embroidery.
Three of the four seeds have even achieved this on anhieb.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal in 2012
The hopes of the Bosnian and Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites of Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are participating in the 2012 Champions League.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have dissolved the latest tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the playoffs.
Leaded by the double-successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation perfect after 0:0 from the game.
The Czechs made a 1:0 (0:0), after the play (2:0) had already been a clear thing in the play-off game at the outside of Montenegro.
Croatia also made no more burning at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland gained a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Heroes Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) achieved another hit for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had been shortened twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow Red Map (54.).
Bosnia had failed at the 2010 South Africa Championship playoffs in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started a new start.
Ronaldo pursued a freelancer of about 30 meters for early leadership in the masks.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shifting qualities and crossed from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of an hour, had their first clear chance by Tornier Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger from the English table leader Manchester City put a headball on the bottom of the latte, but the ball didn't cross the toll line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Arbitration judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the center.
After an attack on heroes of Postiga in the Bosnian strafroom, Stark decided to swivel and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trading meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, who securely transformed the Misimovic.
However, after the pause, the 2004 Vice-European champion made it clear with four meetings.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
In 1976, the European Champion will be the fifth in turn to the EM.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legioners Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to survive a horror second in the early stages.
Finalman Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok with a reflection at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the rotation of the string limit just barely passed by the door of Cech.
After the pause, the cross-border was required to save the Czechs for the already beaten world class tower, the storm of FC Seoul had retreated (50.).
The door was finally cleared shortly before it was finished.
Turkey missed Zagreb’s football miracle.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go beyond 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has to clear his position at the 2002 World Cup Third Bank as safely as well, Croatians can be delighted to participate in a fourth EM ending.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost captured a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance board only the knives, the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even cut the knives in the door.
After the horror, however, Croatia was increasingly controlled.
Even after the break, the Croatians left nothing to burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the 62th minute place for the Dortmund Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga legioners Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made the 4:0 success in the game for a preliminary decision, in the 32th minute lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) is equal to the guests.
Ireland had pushed up from the start, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment, the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leader.
In the 32th minute it was so long.
After a successful defence by finalman Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.

Mass welding on a personal level
Enthusiastically and generously, Peter Englunds begins the new book "Beauty and Horror. A story of the First World War, told in nine destiny halls" with a long list of main characters going to a heart.
Here’s a tip to how to handle: Cut this page carefully and make it to your bookmark.
You will know these people very well in Englunds' romance story, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a light tower in those few moments when you are lost like Englunds men and women in the nebula of the war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who appoints the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not use as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, but rather "a book about how it was." It is "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unprecedented men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountain climbs, doctors, ambulance drivers and office employees.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose members, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flatters on the likeness of the votivs in one church, some come together, while others break down.
The Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating positioning war on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" walks with an expert view of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall to bees, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetseflights are an insolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning of a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, which smells after Kordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is home with their children, and cannon fire hears in the distance.
Who's coming at all?
When someone understands what happens or why this war is going to be carried out at all.
"Lacking facts," says Englund, "reads furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, alps and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmaster.
Their stories were mostly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or striking, but they are extremely lively in the bulk of the collection of small moments losing in detail.
Many of them act by deficiency and helping themselves.
In the history of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminium, fake radiator rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about the replacement of food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of pressed rice and wrapped in hammer fat (and lately served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato scales, shoes made of wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of worms, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and tapferity.
A American recognizes his own demand for wildlife and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all of this, it is what was more intended for men than sitting in the leaf chair, with the dinner sheet or a best-selling and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and doing so, as such a fasade meant civilization and as barbarians weren't given to their own.
On the contrary, a British soldier acknowledges that he is likely to die and no one will take note or take care of it.
“When you take a distance from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens before a public,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrifying as "a convicted man who has been hid in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the younger century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass killer in the measurement that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unexpected manner and there is as much frivolous behaviour as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a sexual illness to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonokokken ethers, because soldiers bought and smuggled on their genitals, in the hope of coming to the hospital," he wrote.
"Those who were really despaired drew him into the eyes, resulting in that they were blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englunds’ poetry becomes soft and yet inconsistent and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war “released in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were mostly fake like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.

After an early failure, a minutely planned attack
Hundreds of police officers were involved in this, some of them wearing employed helmets.
We had decided for the night of Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All the others believed at first to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence emphasized the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks, such as the use of pepperspray against protesters, which violated the rules of the deserternat and brought homeowners a huge increase in public sympathy, could no longer be repeated.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster link had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deployment of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night at the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to get into the park came "in the last minute," someone who is familiar with the commands said what a statement said as "exercise."
“The few police officers involved in my knowledge didn’t know that it was about the Zuccotti Park,” someone said.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the ressort."
One reason for the secret was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to leave the park, but then left when hundreds of protesters came together after they had heard of these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including intervention commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, usually used in high criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that throughout the day many people entered and went out into the park, almost like pendler, so 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people stay in the park,” he said.
Rescue cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were prepared before departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded messages that dropped out of the speakers seemed to be scared by many protesters.
When the public officials entered the park in their bright blue wind jackets, many protesters simply raped their stuff together and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched by 1:45 p.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the surrounding area to intervene, arrests in the park should be needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claimed that they wanted to stop them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the operation of the officials was very hard.
Mr. Browne said that television cars at Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved toward the west through the great breakthrough of the protesters’ personal things, including bags, art races and shoes with clothes, their employees followed the city cleansing that had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were screwed out and pictures of this appeared on the internet shortly afterwards.
A main core of protesters covered near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park position.
Some established barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the camp’s epicenter are connected to their arms.
And two people were sending themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Catastrophe protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The smoke was completed after 75 minutes, according to police statements.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of arrests came, as he said, due to "incomplete behaviour and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Department of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "not led the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they should access, a second group of officials were waiting on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block southward, barricades were built.
It could be seen how the police from these locations expanded the area around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective shelters, were observed to drive people out.
About 28 people were in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent acts of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of the Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of wood.
At the end, one officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of nurses will file a complaint against the city for releases
The union, which represented hundreds of school workers who lost their job last month, plans to accuse the city on Wednesday, because dismissals due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to revoke the releases.
Six hundred and seventy-six school aids, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city and lost their work in a shake on 7 October, the trade union leader had described as a political revenge for the city's access to a health fund that was closed last year to those undergoing the work groups.
This charge was categorically rejected by the authorities.
In an interview with the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that discharges were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specifies the dismissal of school aid staff.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education from a complaint, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference that will formally announce the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will raise Mr. Walcott and the city’s education ministry as accused and count eight dismissed workers as complaints, all of them colorful or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city does not put the complaint in front of the city, and therefore its individual claims cannot be commented.
According to a complaint draft presented by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a complaint about inequalities, claiming that poor schools had lost more aids since they were chronicly underfined.
She suggests that while there were no releases on Staten Island and only few releases at the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aids in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 aids were released in District 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants who were employed at the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students lived in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of supportive parents who can organize grants to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and funds also lost when the city changed its method of calculating extrafinancing for each Armenian school subscription.
The Union also complains that the Heads of High Schools were led to the errors by the language in a memory that approved the dismissal of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually describes the shift of a teacher from the paylist of a school to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been released, not transferred," the complaint draft said.
Mission ended, Congress is ready to understand about Libya
Finally, it looks like Republicans and Democrats are already in Washington to understand the riots in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the rebels, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the ending of American intervention.
The Senate’s International Relations Committee on Thursday decides a resolution undertaken by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praiseing Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their courage.
“This resolution honors the bold people of Libya who have started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"She is a confirmation of supporting her democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, both parties and the White House have argued about the choice of a series of resolutions to approve or dismiss the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution endorsing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide range of sides of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law went into effect in the Senate, and the Chamber also voted for a decision to reduce the funds for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission to a kind of legislative fire – with a Congress that was applied enough to criticize Obama’s approach as part of the mission, but not angry enough to ultimately remove the ground under his feet.
Then the uncertainty of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission was officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates Libyan people for their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-release" and "congratulates the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also confirms "the U.S. national interests in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Board, or will they be divided by the legislators as it did by the law of June?
The last version hits the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the Committee.
Lugar’s spokeswoman said on Monday he had not seen the final version of the new law yet.
According to the chapter, the Senate will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget to be a top priority in almost every Congress legislature period of Republicans and some Democrats.
The actions under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area that is currently being voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far failed to try to bring their amendments to vote, although they have often tried it enough.
Goodlat’s amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to the Congress and covers a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been presented to both Congress and Senate - and others are easily deprived of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balance sheet change and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure" alone in the Senate.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - particularly beginners with Republicans who want to polarize their CV - the possibility to praise that they have "written" such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budgetary balance.
In March, 58 Senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Apart from the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that Congress members can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to revoke the limitation to two President's duties.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits marriage among equal gender is as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags is a repeated template.
Some legislators also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of the states refuse.
As jealous as the members propose amendments, the faster they move as in recent years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced 77 such amendments. at the 110th Congress 66.
The pace falls as compared to the early 1990s, where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the numbers that the Senate library provides.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was already proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Meet, but not defeat," Giffords said in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man had shot her on a next distance during a Tucson election event, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday night on national television, singing only to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that the desire to come back to Congress is bigger.
When she joined Diane Sawyer in ABC's "20/20" news, she ranked by words and needed help in walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the ball, which shared its shell, crossed the left side of its brain and crossed its head from the front to the back.
Three months ago, she returned to the Congress surprisedly to triumphfully give her voice to debt brake.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, smiled and singed - and described her recovery as "serious".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, “Good.”
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly "20/20" special, recorded just before the release of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A Story about courage and hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the attack on January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with a knitted head and a long shell over the head.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages them to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how she performs simple movements.
A nickname with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords flashes another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see the Congress Members singing together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours with therapy a day, said she can’t remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said he had read Giffords on March 12 a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time the six people killed during the attack.
The suspect Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
“Some people have died,” said Gifford’s Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated?" Kelly said.
You were just met.
And you will endure it and you will recover and you will return stronger than ever before.
Troops feel more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gallery that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sings a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and navals gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation in the spring.
A ranking military officer on the Gala, observed among other things by Admiral Mike Mullen and then president, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like babies," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers did well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was compassion.
The crashes contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admirable American public.
The troops will be overcovered with pride for their victims.
But praise has its price, officials say.
The public is increasingly acting as you did the people in uniform suffering.
“We weren’t victims,” said the brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently, the only way to support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The theme is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unthankful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also recognized that the anger that hit the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a consequence, talks about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting the Navy, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "deep, violent veteran" hid under the surface," Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken a lifted state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the surveyers were subtlely asking if he was able to stop the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return.
"When you talk about your service, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian said to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of Americans in war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken out of a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer appreciate military hero as it was absolutely usual during World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, commander of the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces increasing pressure for hard interference in rape
This week, an important hearing on whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in a rape before the military court.
If not, hundreds of complaints are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and was pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped at night by a soldier colleague.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her cassernies in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague wearing a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if she would be accompanied by a drink in her room.
"My alarms went on," Lyman said.
But the Texaner saw her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after she went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claimed.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are alarmingly awaiting a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, where it will be decided whether a complaint they have filed against former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be approved before the court.
The complaint argues that Gates and Rumsfeld are not acting against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional laws of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 complaints, which increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military had forgotten a reasonable reason for prosecution or prosecution.
Burke says she follows the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is built hierarchically,” she said.
"Who are the individuals who are in position to exterminate the cultural remuneration of the ones?
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom might be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of putting all complainants their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints to maintain the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Ministry of Defense, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a request to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court present to Newsweek in detail establish the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come into the army.
Due to a law of the 1950s Supreme Court, the so-called Feres-Doctrin, the government is not responsible for injuries associated with active service soldiers.
"The alleged damage occurred during the military service of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, then the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in the war areas.
The result was that between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them were in battles.
It is time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints except her.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is making a complaint against the four main military academies for the alleged promotion of a female hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disturbance" that the victims of rape received to get rid of them of the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Human Rights Action Network.
In December, her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e., the Administration of War Veterans) in which she alleged her discriminatory practices in dealing with claims of performance for persons involved in sexual abuse in service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of points.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3.158 sexual abuse were reported by the Ministry of Defense.
However, most abuse are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this number takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also investigated the law enforcement rates: 20 percent of the cases recorded in 2010 came to court in the military, just half as many as in civil law.
The complainants in the Burke case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she said, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape tool and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was interrogated by a judge. During this interview, she was asked about the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six people spoke as character witnesses on behalf of the suspected criminal who was finally released.
"I still remember the day when the judgment was read," Lyman says.
"I thought they were going to use the vessels, I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out, I told my commander: 'It wasn't his procedure. It was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unserviceable.
In January 2010, she was dismissed, so she would not receive any support.
Whether the complaint that Lyman and the other complainants have filed is a pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
And again, he says, "I think they should go in."
What is between them and a judgment is this doctrine that is criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a time critic of Feres’ doctrine.
For a decade, the military has not been in possession of the same incentive and the same decree that brings responsibility.
He adds, "The chances are against them... but it's important for them to try it."
These things will change only when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the lawyer of the applicants, will begin with its hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come," she said.
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who agreed to have committed an ammo course in Norway in July, where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time on his computer attack and has hit some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups on social networks.
According to the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how can you find it?
It’s easy – you just need to log in on Facebook.
“We have found it wasn’t difficult to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the chief author of a recent report from the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopedia, Bartlett says that researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers do for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-handed groups across Europe and then visited them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which they were asked about their educational status, their attitude towards violence and the appreciation of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries – without having to leave their office only once.
“It’s a pretty new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online promoters right-wing groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in some sort of surprise turning are “those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and policy scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three contents per day on average, Facebook "Datensupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific works in the title of this page by nearly 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook’s beauty is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don’t reach with his clipboard on the street.
“If you tried to question people from the British National Party earlier, it was very difficult to identify them.”
"They had to inform the party first and it would never have given them access," Bartlett said.
“On Facebook, it all goes away – you go directly to them.”
Others say that the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full interest on Facebook tend to be much more difficult than students who are silent about this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as housing advisors, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify threatened children that otherwise wouldn’t have been found.”
Facebook continues to use the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has created statistics about the relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the 2010 intermediate elections, and a National Happiness Index (which has been used primarily information to which only Facebook has access - Masters of Digital Freedom for a long time know that the site should make its big data funding base accessible for other research purposes.)
However, Facebook users know that the page watches them whether they want it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend who is a thousand miles away, it allows the page to use their own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined policies on how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, in a 2006 study studying the public pages of students on Facebook.
"With her, it was just about her and her friends."
Then there is still a question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years of age, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he said.
"Social research has to take care of social matters - and every lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who held two homoclaves who killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider in Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations supporting hate ideologies and because this supports multiculturalism."
“I know the laws, but I don’t confess myself.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim discontinued Breivik during this monologue, as he “not wanted to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform in which he can express his views.”
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a pre-written speech, the permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the Breivik police to keep in custody for 12 further weeks, he had no access to the media for four weeks, saying the authorities will check all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came to hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and riegel.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything goes beyond a shutdown.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Breivik weared a dark dress and a blue crab and acted calmly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors as he entered the building and left it again.
Despite Breivik’s strange note that he would be part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not spiritually ill and said there would be no proof that he had complications.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seemed to be the work of an individual extremist and not the work of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the disturbance and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looks like a monster, but he doesn't do that," said a victim's family.
"It would be much easier if he did it."
7 lessons from the interview with the deceased Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs’ death on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford and highlighted the technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple’s fans might find the most exciting newly discovered job interview, which was released this week before special film performances on the important markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even named hippie, but he was also an acrobatic organizer who was eager to draw diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a great amount of product between great craftsmanship."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Fachiotes" about the launch of the personal computer, and he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Apple’s jobs were pushed out, and he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in fachiotes, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
Only after Job's death was discovered a full VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to ignore detailed interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds in which jobs are clearly reflecting their thoughts and striving for accuracy.
There are also moments when job perfectionism comes to day when he appears to respond intolerantly to Cringely’s questions and encourages him to deal faster with topics or by-contracts of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somehow incredibly widespread when jobs evaluate what other companies make their opinion right or wrong and represent their own vision of the computer’s future.
It is one thing to read posthume career dignities of Jobs, but seeing Jobs here as the desired dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Soon after he had finished all this, he left and went away.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequence of lost interviews:
How he learned to lead a company:
All the years in the business I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's going to be done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one really thinks about things in the business.
I found it.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalize the accounting at Apple.
Surprisingly how costs were recorded - mostly started with "standard costs", which were fixed on merely assumption and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope was conceived:
Jobs tells about the Blue Box he built with Steve Wozniak, an appliance that allows you to enter the telephone society and bring free distance talks.
A lot has already been written about the device, but Jobs’ enthusiasm as he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-power is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a charged phone, calling and then connecting from a AT&T network to another while moving as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe, and when you greyed into the phone, a minute later it came out on the phone nearby," Jobs said.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something that can control billions of dollars to infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, which was an incredible lesson and I don’t think it would be without Apple.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike that the Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called back in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he searched for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in his phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at the age and it formed my opinions about what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever produced".
He was as big as a bag, had a small screen with brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up to HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
In the interview several times Jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built a few plates, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer together.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the construction and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the tremendous arguments... they shouted to me that it would take five years to [build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he resuscitated Apple, Jobs saw the ways that so many industrial giants dropped in Stockholm with their visions and lost control over their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] who ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is necessary by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times larger, Microsoft could have been in the 1990s.
You have captured the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as art form:
“There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your subtlety.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You need to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it runs out of the taste, it runs out of it that you try to break up with the best good that humans have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said good artists copied, clue great artists.
We are always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren’t the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically-sharing question of whether to listen to an accusation of the health laws by President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the Office that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to consult on the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint that raised 26 states against the widespread health reform decided by the Congress last year, a law that has been labeled by conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which will likely encourage the 2012 presidential contest, which will be full time at the time of the judgment is announced.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the law is to be chipped will probably be Paul Clement, once a lawyer under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement’s Chancellor, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to the defense of conservative law principles.
Another company sponsoring the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who accused the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., who is financially significantly involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington Hotel.
The service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the group leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an declared opponent of the health reform.
The dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been visiting the events of the Federal Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, the judge is exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the low federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefits events near the law and other organizations, and the judge should not be a speaker, honor or guest of such events according to the program."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas was two of the case-related offices, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
“This surprising break with morality and the contrary to the Codex punishes the complaints of some lies of judges, the court abides in the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a Civil Rights Movement in the United States.
"The judges won and served in court during a beneficial event with lawyers with swift proceedings."
Their appearance and support of a donation for this event undermine any claim of impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little view of critics who say they would mix the case too easily with groups led by the agenda, such as federal society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
Conservatives say that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney under Obama’s government when the first lawsuits came first to court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of prejudice, as she is too much engaged in the defense of the law to be unprejudiced.
Kagan does not make any arrangements to do this.
Boeing draws record order of $18 billion on land
Airline Emirate orders 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It is really a rare news that a company receives an order of more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal when the company is Boeing Co., and the list price for these 50 aircraft is totally $18 billion.
Also unusual is Boeing’s contractor: the Middle East, a growing gold mining of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, Chicago’s company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need $450 billion in 2.520 aircraft over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on weekends its largest order for commercial aircraft all-time, measured at the price of the order: 50 Boeing 777 jets.
The Hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also announced in 2011 that Boeing has an option to buy 20 other airplanes, which will increase the total list price to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves the gasoline consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock exchange expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms the airlines as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not so harmful as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important because less than other airlines tend to cancel or move flight orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“You have a natural security,” he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing’s leading position on the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in shake that attacks the top position with the A350.
Boeing’s victory on the airline show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would move the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
The introduction is missed to gain more confidence after customers have requested a higher benefit load and scope.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister loses apparently elections in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealer Fausto Vallejo has supported the PRI in the race for the Governor's positions.
President Felipe Calderon's sister apparently lost her application for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race for the Governor posts in the Western State from the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime during the entire election process, especially yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoacan but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the surveys ... they occupied election cabins, built street blocks ... and ordered people to vote for the PRI."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beat Claderon who had been conducted in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, who is currently an official governor, came to three, a serious defeat for the split and unfortunate left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, refuses connections with drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cards specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were expelled from the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how contrary the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race for the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, the Vallejo from Washington, congratulating and saying, "I think this victory will allow us to look boldly next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term decline trend that will brake the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, ADB’s headquarters in Manila, said the two world’s fastest-growing economies have to do “all in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all sitting in the same boat."
"So everyone is helpful to help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune."
“If China and India can help, then with all means.”
The European Monetary Union has led to a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have increased dangerously and the prime ministers have resigned from both Italy and Greece.
The upcoming severe debt crisis in Europe causes fears that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading developing countries had to gather together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag said that any support for Asia will be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - provide greater negotiation power to the European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India’s Minister for Trade, said that “I’ll do everything in its power” to help the eurozone, since its own economy is now suffering from the declining exports and the outermost foreign capital flow.
“No one wants the euro zone to remain instability and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing big challenges and we need to get a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a task, because else we find jobs for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no incentive to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell aid to Europe to 1.2 billion people in India, of which more than 800 million of $2 million live a day or less.
“Someday they will find that the Greeks with 50 go to retire and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem,” he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid public service employees in Greece, with poorly managed jobs, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crisis in the eurozone would have "significant domino effects" on the whole of Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for 2011/is now "the risk of decay" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets need to create "class plans" to protect themselves against a decline trend and significant capital change in their words.
Emergency warnings from the Pentagon before possible defence cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warmed the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, thus dissolving a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil flow bands.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress can’t achieve a degree in expenditure.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in achieving a budgetary agreement, which would lead to a so-called consignment, would lead to 23% general cuts as well as a stop of numerous new projects.
“As a high cutting, carried out in such a undeniable way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impossible – you can’t buy three quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously harm other modernisation efforts,” Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also have been forced to separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to give civilians a chance to reach the goal with certainty."
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alarm readiness.”
The cuts finally met the fighters,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the capture, serious intervention would adversely affect war efforts in the basic budget," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and attitude supervision that support the war."
"The wages of the staff would be shortened, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of a detention of the Ministry of Defense would initiate a rapid fall of the United States as the world’s leading military force.”
"We are vehement against this draconic action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is a result we can’t live with, and it’s certainly nothing that we should push.”
"The detention is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter."
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new Senator warnings will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or reinforce demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts will remain awaited.
Panetta has increasingly ignored the possible cuts, although he was able to collect years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister painted a dark picture of what could happen - an army with shade, but without cores.
"It's a ship without navy."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air weapon without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of the Kaserans, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech in the Pentagon.
“It is a force that lacks moral and alert preparedness and is unable to take it with potential opponents.”
"She makes a man really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details about how reductions create "significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global use and intervention ability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defence projects of the elimination could become victims, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vessel that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If you stopped the further development and testing of the F35, it would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step towards the relief so that possible threats can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to get rid of a lie
An overview of the current headlines shows how suspicious and widespread fraud and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides of lies against each other.
The lead of Penn State is accused of the Mineid because they have maintained reports that a retired football coach boy has sexually abused.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to be a liar against U.S. President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroying careers and shattering countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became fool when he turned into denial, which was quickly rejected by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of infringement in campaign funding, which is associated with the destruction of an extramarried affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced forgets the media circle that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied at the Oval Office during his second office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shells at school and at college studies are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the test responses so that they can be well done even in their performance examinations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and foams are okay.
How much disappointment do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or “discovering lies” is one that is important to learn for every person, and this is for both personal and professional reasons.
Remote from a social game such as Scharaden, in which it aims to call "Have you!", the removal of a fraud is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data that has been collected from reputable universities over the past six decades that have conducted extensive research projects, especially in physics and psychological fields.
A result of the research is that most old myths have been denied by lies.
Lies look at one in the eyes.
They stitch, steam, red, and don't always shake.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these liars are difficult to discover and remove.
A practiced lies can penetrate into the truth by learning something about the structure of the claims, the fine expressions of the face, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of depreciation. And it is clear that depreciation of depreciation is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding access in our complex world, especially when setting up or surveying of individuals or negotiations or management is part of their own professional responsibility.
Good liars are very good in appreciating others, awakening their interests and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitively as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that extrovert people lie more often than introvert people, that men more often "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - they usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lies than unmarried people.
We also know that when a person is dismissed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It presents a reference point to the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughing, the voice quality of your experimental person.
You should better know when someone usually constantly triple with the foot, so they don’t accuse him of wrong if he triple with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to allegations of notable verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Consider these claims as alarm locks that scream, not as proof of removal.
People who are deceiving may be excited when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet are pointing towards the door or they are turning out, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relax after attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing and change in attitude when all hard questions are gone.
Questions often falsely signal that an appointment conversation is over to keep an eye on after this relaxation after the appointment conversation.
Also pay attention to the language of your experimenter.
Scott Peterson's excavator is famous for using the form of the past when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceitful people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a cute question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifiing language" when they answer a knife question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... as well as the best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptible than real, often shouting the alarms.
There is no magical means to eliminate lies, but you can learn skills thanks to which you can eliminate.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can rarely become a victim of fraud, both in private and in vocational life.
Controversy plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threatened by delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions being angry and at the same time calmly environmentally friendly, that is what the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be relocated from the ecologically sensitive area of sandwiches in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in Nebraska’s parliamentary building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although with a different history.
This was done after a announcement from the Foreign Ministry last week, after which a decision on a federal authorisation for the project would be delayed until the new possible course of checking out the area of sandwiches in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental audit that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered may delay a decision by 2013 after the elections in the coming year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected by Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline has to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets love them because they estimated that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the lawmakers of Nebraskas, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a shift from the region of the Sand Hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and watering.
The recent study on the environmental impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project had little environmental impact, but the source of the energy economy said that the chief auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate survey of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist appointed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 Hillary Clinton consultant, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was entrusted to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice since it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being forced to breastfeed a little child.
A New Yorker family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had suffered a tobacco attack that would put her little daughter so frightened that she had given herself to fear.
The tirade of the lady marmalade singer made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so scared that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disturbance" and "a greater fear of strangers," her family said before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when scenery worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk bought the car, Roseanna Monk went to the lobby with the luggage and Genevieve on the arm in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
And someone came up after me, and said, Do you know what your daughter is doing? And I said, Yea, and go, and take her back on her arm.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "They shouldn't put your daughter down near the door," Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She became angry and began to shit - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to drop water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you have done to my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle fell on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on the arm, and had to be restrained from her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby shouted so much that it had to give up, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelles’ attorney and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is about a non-defined damage compensation, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he would not pay any honor and plan the family to grant the money she gets to give her child cancer.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is placed on the day a child gardener wearing a 18-month-old baby on the arm.”
Climate conflicts brake the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez was in the government, unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in remembrance in the economic history of Sinaloas. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change, and has great hopes for economic growth, is at the government. However, due to climate change, it can not be spoken of growth, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators have worsened.
The low temperatures in February not only caused millions of losses in agriculture, but also had narrow limits to the growth of the state economy and in the first quarter of the year caused a overall decline of economic activity by 3.6 per cent, mainly from the historical decline of agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which brake further economic sectors.
According to a report issued by the Council Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agriculture Development) on the effects of the frost, 582,000 hectares of agricultural lands were damaged, 78.03 percent of which were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has made unemployment constant in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografia observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since from January to March there were 74 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas, which is no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the unemployment rate in July, and the second quarter is equal to the second quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors. Economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments on the policy of public institutions indirectly declaring the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the median cuts of the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are banned to collect dollars, it is not easy to invest for them."
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due to entry problems on the one hand and on the other hand because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work to increase unemployment," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which includes 60.38 percent of employees working in the country without paying into the social insurance funds according to INEGI.
The lowest wages in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Governmental Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 Pesos until September; this is much less than the overall average of 7375 Pesos.
The decline of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded. According to the Secretaría de Economía (governmental economic authority), the ADI was $630 597 from January to June, which is 87.74 per cent in the previous year compared to $5 143 312 in the period.
In 2011, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) records a total investment of 17,280,000 Pesos, primarily from companies from the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In view of the economic crisis, the national government requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 Peso in July at the National Congress, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The national Congress approved a amount of 200 600 000 Peso, but by November the debt could not have been positively impacted on any of the economies.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first year of the government, Mario López Valdés made the government’s inability manifest.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación, agreed that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was very likely this year. It has to be done hard to regain the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to do twice. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well agreed government team, have not been sufficiently harmonised," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year were slowing down and slowing down the country’s economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowing economy that is not in motion enough to create an economic dynamics that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will end the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefinition of calling
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana, in Sinaloa, said the state had to arrange more productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it has been worked. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to re-determine the country's economic call and line, as it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The President of Coparmex emphasized the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government’s efforts to better tracks.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current government has made progress with the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that it has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work in front of it," he said.
Detention for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years of imprisonment and 100 days sentences for possession of eight pounds of marijuana.
The state prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of marijuana to trade.
According to Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican troops in the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez Road versus guard No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer ran in a white furniture in which he held a black bucket in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the convicted goods were transferred to the judge of the district and the penalty remains in the executive institution.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings provided in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the city’s social development authority said that although the construction programmes have already advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid its funds exceeding 11 million Peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounted to almost 50 million Peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state, so far only the Federación and the municipality had allocated funds to the construction work, which is why it is expected to be delayed.
“12 million have to contribute, and although the year is over, they haven’t given us a pencil, and that, although they had to pay us a portion in July,” he said. “To not be too late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already advanced, but we need the money.”
He emphasized that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the state had not fulfilled its obligations, so the municipality had to take a loan of 7 million at the beginning of that time, which corresponded to the amount the central government had to take.
"We had been doing so in the last legislative period because the state had no sufficient economic resources; the programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the state had not used to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although government authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million people have to contribute, and although the year is over, they haven't given us any pencil."
The Court Approves Transition to Digital TV in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of analogs to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) backed the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Deputies against the Presidency, and by which the switching of analogs to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be submitted, due to the lack of eight votes required for legal assault.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he disclosed the legislative decree with details on the shift to earthly digital television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute introduced by the Senate was rejected as he did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality, so the law remains in force.
In the draft complaint elaborated by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the law decree against constitutionality, since the regulations concerning radio and television are responsible for the Commission Federal de Telecommunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) and the Principle of this law would
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies filed complaints against the Constitutional Decree. After the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislature Decree and submitted all activities to establish the digital transfer.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the House of Deputies without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country's government should not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration in general.
"I don't think that if you do this, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body," she also recalled that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, the central government is responsible for constitutional reasons because it leads the state affairs.
Replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, increased signal quality and more channels.
The disruption of the shift, she said, is a disruption of the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, he stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the state, they included a group of characteristics that lay the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalls that many countries around the world had already made the digital transformation, although they had highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government, with the issue of the contested law decree, is involved in the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative would be respected,” she said.
The possibility of counting the vote record in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second position in the governor's election is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual numbering of votes is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programme de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the Governor elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the Chairman of the Council General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November, the Electoral Board had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with the reforms of the state in election matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor his electoral law to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Indicator within the deadlines provided for.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislature and assessed the Ombudsman's voice to the constitutional reforms as "unlawful and illegal", since he has not the right to "decide or oppose a veto".
In an interview with María de los Ángeles Llanderal on the possibility of individually counting the votes, the adoption of the directives by the Council General del IEM now has the possibility that the local election authority can count the vote record partially or fully.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may partially be counted The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the vote counting and calculation is not subject to or is not in possession of the Chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total calculation of the full-filled elections can be made if there is a difference between the likely winner and the second place, equal or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit application of the party or coalition president, which is the second of those candidates.
Vote counting can also be carried out as a whole if, after the regular calculation is concluded, it is found that the difference between the possibly winner and the candidate on second place is equal or less than one percent, provided that an explicit application is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, counting.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second position is almost 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of the total 923 election protocols have not yet been calculated.
His last will
His ash will be scattered across the Zapalinamé mountain, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés hit this Sunday night on Saltillo, his place of birth, and the death scene and a death fair took place on Monday.
According to family members, the last will of the Lieutenant was that his ash would be scattered over the Zapalinamé mountain.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to Coahuila, the capital of Coahuila, along with the other people who died in the accident.
At 12:00 p.m., the Lieutenant's ash landed on the Trauerhall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends came.
At 17:30 p.m., his remains were studied at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was caused by his former co-school body view by the technical abiture and his American football team, Felipe Bacio, during his preparation for the abiture.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and spread his ash over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all of his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town very young Saltillo to join the air force school of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some were unable to grasp because they thought that it would even be on a truck, yet he always tried to realize his dream, pilot.
His cousin Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalled him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as at the time when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he was traveling to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he loved best: a plane flying.
A last goodbye
Lieutenant Felipe Bacio Cortés was welcomed with all honor under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honour was given to him, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, both the Mexican Air Force, the school leader and students of the technological educational training at Saltillo.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter fled from him, in which also the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority were sitting.
At 18.05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés, Citizens of Saltillo, met to be transferred to members of the Mexican Air Force under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez, where he was already attended by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, his sister and his sister.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the fund, military personnel presented the media to eleven people arrested in the same village in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found killed by shootings in different parts of the body and a gratitude committee in a abandoned Finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the 1.5km point of the village road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several temporary people saw the door of the farm house surrounded by a beige-brown wall rise up closely.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons approximately three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark shoes without shoes; another was behind him dressed with a white top.
A few meters away, the body of another person was with a red T-shirt and a blue pants.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the information received on site, the three persons must have been killed elsewhere, since no patterns were found.
On the wall of the farmhouse, there are writings that write an organized criminal band to another, and several shots have been found in walls and doors.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a crime acting mainly in the Cadereyta area, and who are associated with kidnapping, murder, halconeo (man's hunting) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on 11 November and a prisoner was released.
Three real estate and one phone were secured, the arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6:00 p.m., soldiers found a car with two seats in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
At the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 patrons.
Later, November 13, at 14:00 p.m., one of her complexes was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to capture the escape when the military looked at it.
They will be placed secretly in the locations of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday the formation of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakthrough that is going to bring forward.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakthrough that is going to bring forward.
A statement from the Presidency Palace announced that the Monti nominated on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm government training.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet made up of technocratic majority, although it is still unclear when the new Prime Minister will take his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the talks with the political parties on government training.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm the government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well hidden," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has brought the costs of debt to an intolerant amount.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to approve a harsh savings package required by the euro politicians to regain confidence in Italy.
The rapid pressure on Monti increased by the changing market situation, resulting in the Italian debt burden of 7% interest for 10 years, equivalent to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would support this government after all our efforts.”
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency.
Montis’ chances of success were significantly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which had to resign due to the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are intended to bring good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the Central Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential because so far many of its members have spoken against a majority of the government of technocratic, which is currently constituting Monti.
Support by Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the resignation of reforms could again result in a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises with its note that a failure of Montis is a disaster, too.
Monti began Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial associations, as well as with youth and women’s organizations.
The session will be completed on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano on Sunday, who, in response to the crisis, launched an extremely rapid change of government.
After a brief resignation to the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty of the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of the Italian State Debt has reached critical boundaries.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government should last until the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the forecast that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the process imposed by pressure on the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that mutual disobedience and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of individuals from political life.
Spaniards have more games than the Ticos
Of the 22 players from Spain, there are ten over 50 international games on the bucket.
Only one of the 22 enrolled has 50 matches behind it.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game, which takes place today at the San José National Stadium at 15:05, will be compared to players from both countries.
While the world and European champion, number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a significant number of class A selections, the three-color team only has the defence player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup championships) and high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Furie comes at complicated awards at the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the FIFA ranking list below.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last record: The Torwart Iker Casillas, which on Saturday at England (Niederlage 0-1 in London) with 126 overseas games achieved a similarity with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-color team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Last week, Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number 100 approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side tower Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the least games.
Less than 30 games are featured in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national team, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even closer to the 20th border.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, only one recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
The historic gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine major doors, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett took Costa Rica into its tour to celebrate its 20-year-old existence
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is accomplished.
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam says the band is ready to give one of their best concerts on Sunday next to the national stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream would come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This insured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva to Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tournament to celebrate its 20-year-old existence, and on Sunday, 20, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will attend at the National Stadium at 19:30 with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You will read an extract from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costarican fans, a dream is realized when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also accomplished for us.
This is just the second time we played in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I’ve been just once on vacation in Costa Rica. It’s such a beautiful country that we’re sure to stay there for a few days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they experience the day before the concert the most intense.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being on our side all these years.
We took nearly 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and it's sorry to have taken so long until we arrived here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have put in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a pleasure to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves of surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always traveled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, they are the excellent area for surfing. This way, we’ve learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tournament, you have offered gigantic shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no boundaries.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine plates and can play over 120 songs. Everybody likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we haven’t played anymore into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons why these songs have fallen down to us. Otherwise, they might fall into memory.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think that’s why also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
When you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I think no one of us has imagined playing once in a great rock band, and that for more than 20 years.
We also continue to put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music even now together.
We love and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world we always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to participate actively at the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Once and again, a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and are proud to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gards on their tour. We are looking forward to being still friends with all of them and honoring being part of this outstanding Seattle Sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like that has stayed together with your musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands last.
First of all, I think we all appreciate being happy to be still alive and also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, so we have opened musical ways that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music, and we couldn't get better.
Your relationship with the fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge mass of people who love your music.
As long as you think that people have come to you because of music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what they have brought into life without hesitation to be a famous rock star, which has never been interested in us at all.
What are the memories of your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we have written very good songs and at first it was great.
We have been a band for three years that never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about how long we needed. We were still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what was an incredible man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to talk about the ball and go to work, lame, and others
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their works, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose the band for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band loved us best. That’s why we’re curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that fits him.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
The first ones I'm going to hit include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the Bassists I liked all the afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive although it is no longer a fashion phenomenon?
I think we all feel not very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, I fall into the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think it's great because it's worth listening to that music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I believe there are a few songs on the new album that could seem somewhat lightweight, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have some positives on themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard them play like Ed, they're very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life – e.g. when you lose a family member or a friend – it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly represent that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was introduced to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate his leg muscle loss, his home doctor said.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, a 25-year-old incarcerated for violation of human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which has been operational four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a Congress member and his personal physician, told the television that Fujimori would investigate three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that, according to Fujimori, he could be grateful for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He was surgery four times on tongue cancer and he lost 18 kilos of weight, including further diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the abdominal thyroid, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood pressure problems in the legs, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been in the Haftanstalt Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Police since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army's squad who had been secretly acting during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official order, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, begins their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica meets his Mexican official Felipe Calderón on Wednesday, according to the Uruguayan President, which will be the highest point of his schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American president said on his website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks Calderón’s support for the incident with France when French government chief Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discussion, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the countries still appearing as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and made a request to its ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful thresholds and industrial countries in the world. Since January this year, there is an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double agreement with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has attempted to accelerate the concrete agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which has not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
Since 2004, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has contributed to the growing trade of goods between the two countries.
The sliding installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled for 25 years for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but so far never in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he struggles for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the store stores of the world this month has been tailored to the characteristics of the portable Nintende 3DS console, with which you can play without a special three-dimensional glass.
"Mario is the figure that must say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, responsible for the press specialized on Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because so far there were success articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" adjustments of existing titles.
Nintendo’s speaker stressed that although it was three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a “affordable” video game that allows a quick, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in one container: the first part is "easy" to capture the less sketched users.
After that, experts can turn a "second round" through the various games that become more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the profound course of action. However, to overcome obstacles without being victims of "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensional.
This trip to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has no longer been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo turns the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the latest editions: the snore-snore installer has to overcome with threatened platforms to free the princess Peach.
However, the player is struggling with news about movements, the environment, clothing, and the enemy - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom stands for delivery of Portillos to the United States
Guatemala’s president, Álvaro Colom, announced Tuesday that he would take place in the delivery of former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that he would be responsible for the conspiracy of $70 million in the United States.
Thus, the trial ends over the U.S. request for delivery of Portillo so that it can be filed there before the court.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decisive court had already ordered the delivery.
He emphasized that during his government he did not interfere in court decisions and made all requests for deliveries that he had been informed of.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are used to condemn the former State President (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was freed for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This negotiation was preceded by the delivery, but the minister made an objection and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Social Aid Organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
There are more than 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, to which more than 300 people participated, was balanced.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by marginality.
At the celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu, many managers of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions in election times covered the impartiality of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalan Minister for Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Workshop of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was introduced in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example of fighting against difficult circumstances and giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The economic crisis is for the association and the work he does is nothing new,” he said.
An occupied house in which huge parties were organized was spaced
The house owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 house owners left the building yesterday afternoon without resilience.
All points out that the alpine dreams of the neighbours of the house No. 51 have found an end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people left the building that they were illegally occupied and organized enormous fortresses that had driven the neighbourhood to despair. The smoke took place on court order without police intervention.
After the smoking, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"Now, the access will be controlled," the Housewife confirmed.
The house owners who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They also painted the walls and left all kinds of waste, especially doses with alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and the renters moved to despair.
In addition to the building, there is a disk, Balmes 51, which also damaged it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, said Europe Press that her business would have declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the disk indicated that the house owners made her unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost in the disk 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure location was shown by the neighbours because of rest, while, according to their statement, the noise was not driven by the visitors of the disk, but by the house owners, and especially the guests of the festivities that were organized there, and those, according to statements of angry neighbours, became increasingly longer in the last weeks.
The Discocheans said that the distress was so big that she agreed with the owner of the building that she did not have to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbours over the past few weeks.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to clear the building immediately and get the problems of civilian life as well as the downturn of the city district.
He explained that before the summer it had been only one floor of the building, but that the house owners had been on all floors of the building in the last months and almost all apartments. In some it even had come to stealing.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the infringement and to go through the societal actions in the building."
Yesterday another building in the town district of Nou Barris was dismissed by the Catalan police.
At 15:30 a.m., the police approached Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the auction except the disputes about the honorary.
The urban tender on the 16 doors opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the highest point of the missing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its foolish letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared with the Central Park in New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became back to the upper border of Barcelona in the eyes of many, as the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few that are not spreading in the north-south direction, but to the upper ( Mountains) and down (More).
Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
Now, as an example, he was no longer serving the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogi bear.
As far as the city issued a huge competition consisting of 16 competitions in September, for further access doors to Collserola.
No doubt a door refers to the concept of a park.
It’s either that way, or someone has to put the doors on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational perspective, but also with regard to a reflection on the city, the conversation theme in the mouth of all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme on which two members of this old-seated box can meet in the elevator.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare consensus between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán, "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountain" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discussion of Ildefons Cerda, which has been carried out over the green apples, has not been carried out.
“You should assume that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex,” the architect judges, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" provides a "lexical fall" in itself: You should not imagine it as an access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which you have to deal."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban-building experience, considers the proposal a “intellectual challenge” that “consequent dangers” in itself.
The dangers resulting from the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swing song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is the limitation of what can be built.
"Limiting something always means fixing the next step," i.e. crossing it.
“You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [relevant to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM) can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "beat the dumb ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that she gave her body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the letter of reference that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" on whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams created ("the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex as the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There have been 16 competitions throughout the section," he says, "on the axis of the mountain lake. But there is no long-range perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collapse alongside that of the architect of the gate.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely ensure that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, thus creating a soft transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red released the Mayor’s brother from Monterrey from the trial that was led against him because of apparent oppression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Red Casino has forgiven him in front of the second criminal court of the district that has conducted the trial against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for oppression.
After the attack on the Royale Casino, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Red Casino, released a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is supposed to be watching, which forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the bet house.
The prosecutor initiated a criminal proceeding against the brother of the panic mayor, arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 and Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed in this place 49 days after a second arrest order after the official of the Ministry of Public Affairs had rejected the crimes for murder and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta’s prison because he probably had the owners of the Red Casino with a half-million peso. However, he stayed just a few hours in the mid-security trajectory as he presented murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as a prison in San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, the secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, was appointed to him by a decree, noting that after nearly two months of investigation there is sufficient evidence to bear Jonah’s guilt for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the lawhouse to open it in return.
This Monday, Casino Red’s representative Víctor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to punish the Mayor’s brother, which is why he will be put on foot in the next few hours.
During the court hearing Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, asked García Gómez whether he had fixed the damage and who the owner of the lawhouse had pronounced his forgiveness, but the lawyer rejected the name.
In accordance with case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is freely spoken. In the following case, no claims can be made against the proceedings, and no damages are required.
After hearing the representative of the Wethouse at 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately placed on foot.
Judgment Secretary Jorge Yánez went to San Nicolás de los Garza’s city prison to inform Jonas that he had been freed and his case would be put into the records.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome reports details of the aircraft accident in which Government Secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigations on the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died indicated that the helicopter had spoken directly to the ground with his entire unrestrained structure without the pilot had been able to have an emergency.
At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transportation, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before the launch that weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees in 25 meters of height, while the helicopter lost the rope, appears to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 prisoners, which is why he met all the requirements for the transport of the staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the machine was down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the insight covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which satisfied all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a stretch of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they may take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aviation and Assistant Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flew at a flight speed and fell on a soft ride.
“This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the blow it was a normal flight operation.”
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account during the investigation:
View flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the flight of sight, which means that the crew had to have adequate views during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the journey towards the border area between Mexico City and the state of Mexico, some deeply hanging clouds rose up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley due to the clouds.
Inflation site:
The crash coordinates and the last crash recording of the helicopter agree, and possibly there has not been any loss of control over the plane before the crash or any deviation from the flight route.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available so far indicates that the helicopter has been climbed straight and lateral.
The pattern of the distributed aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter was flooded on the ground with its uncovered structure.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft are not allowed to close fire or explosion at the location of the accident.
The latest investigation results indicate several soil contacts.
In the local investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above the sea level. The area is abstract and has a sharpness of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to be broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several soil contacts.
According to a minuscule search in an area beyond the locked area at the location of the accident, no distributed aircraft parts were found, enhancing the assumption that the unhealthy aircraft structure was crushed against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute conducts a research project to find out the gen for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexicos Social Insurance Institute) announced that it led a research project on the discovery of the gen for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" to be found with the genetic markers associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Director of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI clinic, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students at Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested persons can come to the sports sites of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday at 8.00 p.m.
He emphasized that the investigation on the sports court of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of Mexico) began and continued since October 8 on the sports court of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of Mexico).
When the goal of 500 to 600 researchers has been reached, the study is continued on the sports site of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on the site of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
The aim of the study is to identify the factors and the role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the World Diabetes Day, he said it is expected that three thousand children and adolescents aged between six and 14 years should fill with consent and nutritional questionnaires under the supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on these Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, size), controlled blood pressure, and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (an attempt to identify genes related to obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out due to the concerns of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the percentage of obese boys and girls with obesity increased by 77%, and overweight increased dramatically,” the IMSS specialist said.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the Mexican population differs from the other peoples.
He stated that an (e) Mexican (in) average was 65 per cent of Indian-Americans, 30 per cent of Europeans and 5 per cent of Africans, which reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity implies the inability to burn the excess energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigators existed in a comprehensive study of children in which they would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of darker skin falls in the neck and inner arm (akanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the predecessor stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest to them changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day before the TV and using transport means instead of walking short ways.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugar beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt by UNAM prevents hit holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM developed asphalts modified with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that came out of the streets were observed, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 strikes if the rain period in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City Area of the Valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher, even reduced the numbers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) were even significantly reduced.
In his speech "Technologically hit holes", which he held at the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is to develop asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which supports greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road coating and thus avoid the emergence of hit holes.
He explained that asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a carbon compound, from which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together they allocate its characteristic dental behaviour to the street coating.
The teeth-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that this behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of nearly 180°C, at 120°C, it is very teeth-elastic and nearly fixed at 50°C, while it becomes stiff at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly had a flexible street coating consisting of six layers of material, of which the last three asphalts.
Between the top layers there is a welding layer of asphalt, which consists of small, in asphalt, and then solid stones.
Each individual stone of this welding layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and powers are generated, this layer allows for a good distribution of power in the road coating.
"If there were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemistry engineer said.
"After the welding layer," he said, "a last layer is designed, the so-called carrier layer consisting of small stones, i.e. sand also baded in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the welding layer and they need to make rigidity.
This street coating receives and distributes most of the forces, the carrier layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it consists must be maintained.
The weather conditions, particularly moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to take into account, above all the water,” he said, “because it significantly affects the behaviour of the welding layer.
When the surface is moisturizing, water penetrates into the layer and only occurs difficult again, causing a deviation of all layers of the street coating and as a result the appearance of hit holes.
When a hit occurs," he said, "the roof layer will be removed first, while the welding layer will only be affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained with the first signs through adequate maintenance programs."
The Member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load was another major cause of the occurrence of strike holes, which is why the thickness of each layer of the road coating should always be relative to the vehicle load and ensure that this system is complied with in order to avoid frequent strike holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research studies waiting for, for example, asphalt emulsions already on the market in other countries, with which the hit holes could easily and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing the candidate of Del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impacted that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in granting the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with putting a silver crown and the band she showed her as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar), the department has already moved to 14 missiles and Melina, Aljuna Aljuna (19), Aljuna (19), Aljuna (19), Aljuna (19) and Melina (19), Aljuna (19) from Valle del Cauca (19), Aljuna (19) and Diana (19) (19) who held the crown (19) (19.
The big question that many people ask today is, what was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favourite who had shown at each performance that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for free she was elected to the queen of police and to the Best Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty queen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of the Miss Navarro.
The first factor that is considered crucial for the jury’s decision to appoint her to the First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “What book has most influenced you and why?”, which was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez by Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca responded to the questionnaire:
“I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it’s a way to civilizate myself, finally I think that the book that was the strongest characteristic of my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’ is a quite deep-going book.
At the moment I am reading 'Schuld and Sin'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russin, a beautiful book that warms up 'Passion'.
An answer that hit a little contrary, first because of the concept of 'sich civilization' and second because she did not explain in concrete ways in which each of her book had influenced her.
But after the ceremony was completed, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle’s favourite was burned.
A Bogota journalist stated that the fact that she was the preferred one who had placed all the incidents and received all the prizes in advance (Gastronomic competition Easter, public vote on the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous of what the Queen couldn't stressed.
And this was observed at her first appearance in the bathroom dress at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the Crowning Festival.
Although she was certain of both, she lacked the strength and vibration that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico saw.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter from the program "Como en Casa" at RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss shows that the candidate who won most of the prizes during the competition will eventually not become a queen.
In addition, Valle left the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the key to the national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the International Jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia; you need to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feelings that she had worked together in the competition before participating in projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the deriries and the fibrose she was noticed in the magnesium, but this is contradictory because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good nutritional habits and more responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which, sincerely, was hard to notice, pressured her point on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos from the Cromos magazine believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place has to pay her."
Due to this prize, which will be granted for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, after the shower in the bathrobe, a cruel prediction that should be fulfilled at night. It was delighted that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort prize to not let her enter the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is coming from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent the appointment of Colombia’s national beauty competition at one of the international competitions.
Nevertheless, as one of the queens who had escaped the crown in history despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the job of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscopist of the State Prosecutor’s Investigation Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), a "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has worked for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to travel to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he settled over Valle and after completion of the required courses specialized in lophoscopia, which is the study of the skin that is exposed to swelling, i.e. the hands and foot surfaces.
In the week of the intervention against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was urged to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be, so he should take the ten fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not at least.
He had no bar, was like a farmer dressed in the area, wearing no glasses and was much thiner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Weaponized with a hole, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, the man from Puerto Tejada, who was responsible for it, told the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinzón that it was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscopy from Sijín in Cali, the value that was granted to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of Cano was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a precise science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and kidnapping matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When detained, many criminals make false documentation or do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to cut a piece of wall out of a house at a thief’s time, because the thief had just supported himself at this place with his hand when he came out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for removal of fingerprints, but in this case we could take the footprint of the entire hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thieves," he said.
Using fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or loaded.
A dead man was recently found surrounded by snapshot bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object with chemical or physical reactions."
When they appear, a plant cell or a band is used to take part.
The prints are then sent to the Asif, which is the Criminal Database, or to the Personal Status Office.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians without expenditure,” the CTI expert said.
He said it wasn’t all the way it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Like not all gold that is shining, it is not all that touches a fingerprint.
However, it can be used when you perform a corresponding comparison.
The "Empire" calls for the New York authorities out
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part came to the space command and moved its location to a nearby park.
The members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked New York authorities out on Tuesday when they tried again with a judicial order to enter the Manhatten Square after they had been displaced from the place in the morning grey and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators struck in front of the Zuccotti Square, on which they met with a jury order allowing the "emperates" to enter the new tent at this place, while another part of the movement remained at the room command and occupied a park further north of the city, where it came to be.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the ground, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means for the return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the spokespersons of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray concluded that the response of the "employed" to the rupture of her tent camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent rupture of the place and allowing the demonstrators to rupture the tent.
In addition, the "Empurts" occupied a new park that is located on the crossing of the centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue close to the entry into the Dutch tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray couldn't give accurate numbers, he assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with hand sheets.
The organization assured that hundreds of people were found in this place, where a departure of religious leaders were also entered as signs of their support for members of the movement and for the mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti place (a private property) remains closed in awaiting a judicial hearing which is still set for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the smoke occurring in the morning grey is to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the place took photocopies of this judicial order and distributed them, even giving them some police officers who guarded the place, which had resulted in "some small collisions", as Bray reported, some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, as well as the application of "the regulations adopted after occupation and to prohibit the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other things they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg explained to the press that due to this judicial arrangement, the reopening of the space for public transport and the demonstrators had been cancelled. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to relocate with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The Mayor personally defended the smoking of the Zuccotti Square held in the morning grey, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and they were decided because the demonstrators were "following the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to smoke the place because he had "transformed into a place where people came not to demonstrate, but to break laws and in some cases to harm others" because "some businesses would have received threats" and the inhabitants feared "the quality of their lives".
"The smoking in the morning grey was eclectic and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," the spokesman of the movement added, accusing the mayor of "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The officials of Occupy Wall Street informed that they were thinking about organizing “great actions” for Thursday, together with municipal organizations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have already been late since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Maria at the TV Christmas show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1, in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", chicken at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model at a Canadian television Christmas show will be the Virgin Mary.
The private TV channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Ball singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will be invading a very special Virgin Mary life.
CTV today disseminated images of the television program, in which Anderson - also for the dissemination of a self-round porn on the internet, in which she appears along with her former husband, the shooter of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a puppy to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderator in the broadcast "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in late March in Buenos Aires, and who does not stand far from this controversy.
Bublé recently named North American Kim Kardashian “Hure” at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has still been paralyzed in recovery after the devastating earthquake that ended in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced during World War II.
The first government estimates in Tokyo assessed the damage to $300,000, a hit that appears to be weakened despite the difficult world economy situation.
After three quarters of falls, the data on gross domestic product from July to September ultimately completed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% to the annual quota.
The second-quarter measured value - in Japan the financial year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The resurface can be declared partially by the sale of machinery for the rebuilding of the terrestrial and subsequent tsunami-devastated areas.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the decline of .9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of inconsistent increases.
However, the actual transformation of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on keynsian efforts that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awake in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, paid by the growing expenditure for vehicles, travel and leisure jobs.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has trusted the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee currencies" of investors who fled before the eurozone debt crisis and the tremendous forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that bursts like a tomb on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony brought their weak business results from July to September back to the Yen notation.
While the markets continue to occupy the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of the Yen,” said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are really not very uplifting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most Member States had shown clear signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which takes the turnpoints of the world economy, highlighted that the brake would be drawn to the largest economic potential.
Because he dropped from four tenths to loss to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 points in August.
The eurozone is even below this average value, which is 100 after it has fallen by eight-tickets to 99.13 points.
Athens again leaves doubts
Papadimos says savings would be adopted, but conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk prizes of the peripheral countries and broadening uncertainty, Greece continues to distort the labyrinth that leads to the big European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is shown slowly by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, noted yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days extended at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and, in any case, return his request to the new election in February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions made at the summit of October 26," Papadimos said yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its highest point tomorrow with the voting of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 employment promotion programmes, the reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax prevention are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not express doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge from the EU and the IMF, the organization that urgently needs the 8,000 million Athens, saying that he would not approve of a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated with the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, has reaffirmed yesterday that it should not be delayed at its request: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would "not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economics, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the Troika inspectors would come back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of €8,000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knees still have feds for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain's "prevalent" position in relation to this type of financing.
Spain has "acquired a world-wide dominant position in the role of smaller funding".
The Queen of Spain, Sofia, recalled yesterday that Spain has been the second donor to this fund for international cooperation worldwide over the past two decades, based on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity based on trust in humans".
She was convinced that this kind of business would be "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the millennium goals hidden by the United Nations by 2015 and "especially the goal of living under the day, the number of people with a few few dollars."
Spain "continue to work" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carry out this task responsible", noted the queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, are women's "creation of new capacity and better chances for these empires."
"We have recorded many successes" and "confronted many challenges."
The summit on small loans is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to encourage “two basic objectives”.
The Queen said it was expected that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families would have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
The concept of smaller loans goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia considers as an "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described her as a "admirable idealist who has prescribed the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on site.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at the Elfenbein Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 "We all have been able to observe a continuous development," the queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday made her the evaluation as the "family head" in Valladolid and as the "family spokeswoman".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by animating the participants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “a ethical command” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that small loans were "the hardest and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty", and that the governments of industrial states now should work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and would not allow the solidarity of the crisis to become victims.
For Spain, small loans are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the "super success", "marginalized" people who "are always standing in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city of Solid, which "opened their doors, stated."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President due to general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, left in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulty.
The future of Europe was originally not intended in the programme, but it was implemented in the autumn, especially in order to provide enough for those activists who consider government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as a lax.
The proposal for the presidency of the European Commission proposed by the Presidency was almost unanimously adopted.
Of 1001 delegates, only nine votes against, ten votes included.
The several minutes-long Standing Ovation, which was first considered to be Angela Merkel due to her intervention permits, as well as Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later, did not have any doubts on the part of the three European finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor bears - as well as the claim - the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “the time for a break in Europe has come.”
This could be expressed by a strengthening of the control of the European Union's amendment to the Treaty of Lisbon to the budgetary policy of the countries in the eurozone, but this could be a face-to-face in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting."
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble Pate was clearly faced.
Surely it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Grov Britain is facing the matter rejecting, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is placed.
In the same way, the delegations have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the ECB Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a strengthening of Germany's position.
Consequently, the Chancellor of the Climate Reconciliation within her party has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty that would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the European application of the significance of "German-French friendship" devotes a paragraph, Angela Merkel does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic Army.
What does fraud represent in disease reports?
According to family aid, UMP and government now attack the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family aid cash and talk about the issue of social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has always been repeating since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on an effort to undergo the economy in a hard sample, but on the other hand, it is not less a prerequisite for a right-hand presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on labour memory reports.
First with budgetary objectives: the government aims at the introduction of a fourth day of care before taking into account a report of illness in the private sector workers.
In good German, this means that a sick employee without the permission of the specific company would lose four-day wage, thus at least 15% of its monthly income.
A mapping that, according to the newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to raise anger would, however, help to spend 280 million euros.
And that was in conjunction with a more symbolic matrix: to provide the state officials with an unpaid career day in the case of disease (to date there is for them, unlike the three career days in the private sector, no career period).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also repeats fraud thematics again, this time being aimed at abuse associated with labour absence.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and beyond these refunds will be reimbursed if this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, before the RTL transmitter's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report as regards the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports appear slightly disproportionate.
In fact, it has been subject to permanent observation since 2002 as well as political offensives, which have been most commonly fruitful.
The French are no longer sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let's start with the numbers across the country.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Fund, more than EUR 237 million daily inventories were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health, the day-to-day findings in 2008 represented 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% of maternity leaves and work accidents and 54% of disease leaves, which amounted to EUR 6.2 billion.
2.5% of health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average only 14.5 hospital days were approved to the French compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A median value that conveys certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers involved have not taken a single hospital day.
Another study recorded this time by health insurance shows that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Therefore, compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to no longer work inability anywhere else.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French State Centre for Science (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absentee rate (firmly justified or otherwise) was synchronized between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16% in Low and 18% in the UK.
The fraud in disease reports represents a disruptively small proportion of black work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak outmav is achieved here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 shows that there are systematic controls in disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (published high school for education and further training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term disease reports, heated in 37.050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In systematicly controlled cases of disease reporting for more than 45 days, under 1.2 million 11% of "unfitted or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
In total, this accounts for 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have made a report of illness.
A figure representing, for example, only a weak outmav compared to those of black work.
According to UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents a tax loss of between €9 and €15 billion per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day compensation, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding the fact that the governments assigned by the Union were not enough for a hundred days to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions made at the occasion of the Euro summit on 27 October is the "Chief Task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone is "to play" as he added.
Accordingly, Papademos has planned to reduce the country's state deficit "about 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new Spare Reductions
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent on Monday to the already approved abductions regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not get ready for an additional savings abduction.
"We will not vote in favour of new abstentions," he said at the occasion of a parliamentary assembly of his party New Democracy.
He had explained himself with the requirements of reducing budget deficits and debt, as well as the fight against loss, but he was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic emergence.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from granting the necessary loans over €8 billion without a written warranty to all parties about their support for the planned withdrawal, responded to Antonio Samaras that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure from Auven.
Euthanasia and accompanying freelancers must be legalized, according to an expertengemium
Canadians live in refusal to die, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together in terms of painlindrical treatment to provide the best painlindrical remedies, and this also goes beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts involved in various fields of ethics, law, and medicine are linked to each other.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice occurs, in patients who are deemed to be able to make such a decision.
As a startup, experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the globe.
Although Canada has been ranked in 10th grade, the study notes that “medical care has produced a culture in Canada where people are afraid to cut the theme of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painful means, reports experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in the hospital.
It is considered from all over the country that the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital is the highest in Quebec.
In the helicopter issue of Euthanasia and Suicide accompanying, the authors of the report find conclusions that are contrary to the position of the federal government who has already made no amendments to the Criminal Act regarding Euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
But now, according to experts who have inspected all those countries who have legalized or decriminalized their approach to euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no proof that such decriminalization would have misconducted practices in their application, i.e., practice execution of euthanasia or uncommon suicide.
On the contrary, much more cases of such infringements are encountered just in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed at a teleconference.
"Eutanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Suicide is also practiced in Canada, although here clearly illegal," Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians support Euthanasia
On the contrary, we believe that according to a 2010 Angus-Reid survey, 85 percent of Canadians had already been in favor of euthanasia, as they believe that this allows people at the end of their lifestyle to mild their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalization of euthanasia does not result in transmitting the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to people who have already committed suicide, 41% of respondents have the opinion that they should not be criminally pursued.
As regards the maintenance or attitude of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
It also indicates in its recommendation list that in the Criminal Act it should be stated that the suspension of the funds for which a legal rejection should not be regarded as criminal.
In addition, the expert team calls for healthcare professionals to be trained to respect a disruption of lifetime funds, and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The Board stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together on pain-lenting treatment to provide the best pain-lenting remedies, which also goes beyond cancer cases.
Finally, as regards the means of pain relief or life-saving reduction used already in Canadian healthcare institutions, the Board calls for at least to take them into consideration, as they serve as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and engage in the same practices.
Reservations of other experts
Some healthcare experts have already submitted reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada’s expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, an expert in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts, among others, as "extrem" because it has no limits in the final phase of euthanasia practice in patients.
“This opens the doors for a situation where anyone who is tired of living and older than 18 years of age asks another person to be helpful to him in his suicide,” RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in society's social welfare.
But now, he says, there would be "directions and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titled "Pro-Eutanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the reports regarding the non-profit abuse in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw power
Damascus has a "complete"
Syria is more isolated
The Partisans Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated before the authorities of the Auben Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Bashar al-Assads, however, which is opposed by Russia's support and a "complot" directed against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before Syria’s exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbouring countries, had addressed its position in favour of a resignation by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the official Arab Prime Minister, who had called on President Baschar al-Assad to establish his power in Syria, in which about forty civilians and members of the government were killed.
“If Bashar puts his country’s interest in the heart, he would decline, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syria’s political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbouring country, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu, on the other hand, complained that the Syrian regimes since the beginning of the year, Turkish mediation attempts had not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them, must go," he said in a statement on Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily harsh attitude.
The U.S. has, on its own, consensus against Assad, as well as the powers of the Syrian regime, has been overwhelmed as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, and countries like Turkey have hit an increasingly harder tone in Syria in the face of the repression," said Mark Toner, a spokesman of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government force died in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two other civilians were killed at "Scoup shifts and severe bombing attacks around Jobar" in the town of Homs.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Minister for Avian Trade, Walid al-Muallim, was of the view that the country "taxeed up to the end of the crisis".
In addition, he has responded with emphasis to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his tasks, representing his estimate a "dangerous step" after.
"Don't let Syria go," he added, under the confession, "the complots struck against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
France's Minister for Oven Trade, Alain Juppé, also spoke in favour of the transmission of UN observers to make civilians against the regime's repression that he would be caught in his "paranoia" to protect him.
A planned reassembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plans decided on November 2, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the settled cities, as well as the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Auvène Minister Sergey Lawrow has classified the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" yesterday to protect himself from the support of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the outlet plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be ready to sacrifice
Mario Monti, a future Italian government chief, has required a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "offers" requires to recover the lost creditworthiness of the government in the last months of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to call a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrates.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a number of victims," Francesco Nucara, one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the official President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Deputies, had, however, been waiting for Mario Monti to make a vote of confidence to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be summoned in the presentation of M. Monti’s deletion list, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen of ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock markets and bond markets required their time.
In a "democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed that it is very "assured that markets will be kind and understandable."
His appointment by the President was initiated by the markets, but the anxiety had again increased, particularly after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The official prime minister should create a staff of mainly technocrates, although he had emphasized that he would also like to involve "politics".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he said.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the Chairman of the House of Deputies, the new government should be given confidence by Parliament until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working in all urgency with the aim of making Italy a "repeated protagonist" in Europe since his role.
EU Commissioner Olli Rehn, a spokesman, stressed that "not to change our diagnosis with regard to the Italian economy even taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary compensation goal in 2013 despite the savings plans taken over the past few months, has in particular requested new hardships.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the Italian heads, who will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also stands on the need for economic curriculum, a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficiency figures.
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epoche change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenging of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", according to the guide authors.
The grove unknown in this will be the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent pre-elections as Italy has come up for $200 billion by April 2012.
Russian scientists help Iranian Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable sprinkler, confirmed a nuclear-risk-specialised American NGO on Monday.
The ISIS Institute for Science and International Security is based on the report recently published by the International AIEA Agency for Nuclear Safety and other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had announced last week its "small concern" in the event of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to have left the center to establish a company in Kiev, which "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its recent report, the AIEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear fuels system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who is not only experiencing this technique, but also as a member of a member membership of the agency reported, his entire professional energy program has unnecessaryly deployed his career over the immediate arrival of this technology."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violences, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either decreased lightly in the same period, or have only increased lowly.
According to these data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decline in Jewish targeted crimes and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hater motivating crimes" has increased in very weak Mave to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences motivated by crimes, according to the FBI.
“After a 2009 weakening, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes growing again,” the Human Rights Organization emphasized First. “The rise in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,” the organization said in a statement.
"Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights," Paul Legendre, a director of the organization.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude towards hate crimes.
“Hate crime” is an inheritance in U.S. federal law from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish crimes directed against races, skin colors, religions or generations, and now also related to crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, making the service again similar to that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enables better readily live tracking the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and tracking your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to track your messages, if you subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August at a low percentage of users", Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its few instinctives Functioning, bestücked with something esotherically anmutended Wordlaut (RT for referenced repetition of the contributions of another person). followfriday for recommending to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiatives, thus opens a public plus large with a maniement more comparable to that of the large public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"It's useless, excited and very similar to Facebook," @jemb123 writes.
"The function"activity will help me to better track certain elements of my flow twitter," said @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Enrollment of a "Golden Household Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to incorporate a golden budget rule into the constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid any degradation by rating agencies in Austria’s top-bonity (AAA).
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann was very personally announcing this decision about the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the Austrian government debt is 74.6%, so far above the criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but significantly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s payment capability did not drop to AAA’s hit on AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion extra interest each year,” Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democratic Auven Minister argued.
Austria also calls for the Brussels summit of the Eurozone Member States on 26 October: the heads of state and government would have requested the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 as well as a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The matrix taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to incorporate such a "reglement" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) annually, since 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0,35% limit of GDP, while regional states and communities should have balanced budgets.
The objective is to erase the budgetary debt under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention on currencies
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese official force would interfere again on the currency markets if the Yen would continue to rise.
“If we fix an excessive volatility in the Yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we did for the last time,” Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was accelerated close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is in order to impose a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen regularly, baptised by purchases of investors who consider the yen as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro fell under the symbolic late of 105 yen near the level that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar noted the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This steam fire of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archive as it reduces the costs of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the revenue value drawn from Japanese companies from abroad as they exchange them in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (North-East) for its reconstruction," Noda, who fears that this destruction of the Yen could already kill the weak rise in the keim.
The third world power has gained the growth of -1.5% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the rising increases in exports and the consumption of domestic "blowned" by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the celebration of the Yen does not reflect the "economic foundations of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, on the other hand, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all the ground-breaking measures to strengthen the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, said the BoJ had already launched "adequate cancellations", which made it alleged that no additional currency locking would be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the notes bank had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) to spend the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion) coverage amounts it had spent for various purchases of financial securities to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest funds quickly to the height, stock exchanges make retractors
The risk of inflammatory debt crisis does not permanently eliminate European figures.
Despite the office of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries are constantly increasing.
The stock exchanges that are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone will also drop a little further in negative fields on Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10.4% and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions on the returns of state debts in the Eurozone in difficulties, the global stock markets continue to release some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by the press agency Reuters.
The stock exchange in Tokyo, which, on its own, suffers from the re-experienced fear of the market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a decline of 0.7%.
“Japan has focused its eyes on Europe as well as the rest of the world, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This reanimation of concerns about the future of the eurozone damages the united currency, which its bass continues on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 p.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, so it gave 0.4% off.
She has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had made a request that, in particular, provides the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's interest rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, with those of the Spanish title rising to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the concerns of investors.
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions made at the Eurozone summit on October 27 is "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the victories of the markets, as the parliamentary elections will take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest sheet ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historical high.
In expectation of growth rates in the eurozone
Statistically, France accounted for an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which was slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in the numbers of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts are worried most.
Germany, however, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first high account of the euro area is expected at 11 p.m., warning the EU Commission against the risk of a re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win about dogs
If there is a matter that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term views or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting to launch, to reflect on this topic and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will bear fruit only if it examines the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution will lead to a double demand for electricity by 2050, a huge share of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, the deficiency of fossil resources must be mild in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without forgetting the compulsory need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a issue that has been missing from the ecological debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision to find a substitutable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which is currently planning to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to call only a few countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, on its own, decided to connect another unit to its park to Fukushima by resuming the Three Mile Island work set after the atomic crash.
Although the German model, directed to renewable energy sources, is occasionally presented as a model, the reality contradicts the discussion.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a reduction in electricity price, an increased reduction in energy dependence on import gas, particularly Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable in a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason for thinking.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European board leader in terms of wind energy, from which it relates 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, in exchange for wind energy; due to this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the sustainability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill as opposed to our French households.
Since energy prices in the globalized economy represent a key role in competitiveness as well as an industry’s stability on the national ground, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong rise in the price of energy, causing the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power to illusion.
Surveys have shown that this is a price that the great majority of French are willing to pay as little as it reveals resistance to the principle of this energy source.
On the contrary, the energy policy of our country has enabled us to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings innumerable specialized small and medium-sized companies to international markets and makes them creative innumerable jobs.
If France decides to get out of nuclear power, a large portion of these SMEs would be the victim, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment assets and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly combined.
Which electrician would have been assigned to EPR designed to work for sixty years if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to resolve the energy equation, it is necessary to realize that there is just as little one as a devil's work is a miracle means for producing electricity.
Areva’s developed, CO2-poor solutions for the use of nuclear energy and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority carrying out compromised and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their teams who have made a name because of their professionalism are just occupied by the security performance.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; so he passed without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was sworn by reactor construction as well as infinite human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused by the mass that caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach, as well as cooperation by the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft that allows him to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since among the electrical technicians it is considered the desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a great gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by leaving them free trail to ride the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate emotions, dogs, and party owners of a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many corners - overload of police, courts and administrative bodies due to one of the numbers subjected to policies, compatibility of these policies with the status of a "country of human rights", as France itself had entitled.
Recently, the disturbance directed against foreign students on the official side had highlighted the weekly views, which the Interior Minister had deliberately announced (see Libération of May 23) that France "no talent, Maurer or Kellner needed from abroad."
But this policy was rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this subject.
On the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac was attacked, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, may not be a problem for a country", on the left side by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 described France, "can't take over the whole world's poverty."
The only difference is in the degree of grossness.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clampers was divided in 2005 by both right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of greatness that you want to agree with the immigrants.
In its program, Francois Hollande is limited to banality that suggests partnership development allowing us to solve our "immigration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections; however, it is economically expensive.
As Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron, the economists have discussed in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broader consensus among specialists regarding the growth of salary and the positive influence of the economy.
Limiting immigration would increase growth and harm the labour market situation.
The concerns about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to replace the local workers, especially the less qualified, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are actually significantly more complementary than local salaries, since they are exerting seriously occupied in sectors that are technically unloaded.
The low-qualified immigrants are working in sectors, the local salaries are traveling little, the more qualified among the immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Like a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthetics, this complementarity between locals and migrants also has a positive effect of immigrant admission on wages and domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that an 1% increase in immigrant flow leads to a mixed, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And these without regard to the fact that the diversity of ideas created by immigrants and economic growth is too significant (a high proportion of citizens among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a 30-year-old person emigrating to Germany spends an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to produce the missing cuts "with the teeth" at the arrival of his mandate.
However, these teeth, which should deny the immigrants, achieved precisely the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy and now remains to think about European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good, and also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember himself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had taken place all the 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal, and the ruler in Greece.
Some believed that it was rich to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy once and for all over their enemies.
It is known since Napoleon’s “the little one” that it was a characteristic of mentality.
The general right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this, and can be as well as a "repressive instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at that time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, training, education, economic and social spirit, legal practice.
The crisis in Europe in which we are present is a economic crisis, but it is as much and, first and foremost, a political and democratic crisis.
In this regard, the change in mind of the Greek-false referendum would have been double-sequent: once that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the alarming feeling of their impotence, their inability.
This ambivalence should be considered as an over-aging.
The truth is that the frontlines of democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to press on the success of the national referendum, which was organized depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A freelancer for the European sovereignty or a jump with linked eyes into the empty of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hacking, but a collective task, in full, clear and constant, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we don't know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and that rules in Europe.
It is all Europe that is due to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering under its power and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated internationally.
You are worried about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - there is a whole Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and therefore each of the nations that are joining it.
The urgency is to give people sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
Because it is in general that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and drive the future through investments.
The emergence of the crisis has made decisions at European level on condition that cannot be enjoyed without total democratic legitimacy without causing us to be completely destroyed.
After this proposal has long been fought by Jacques Delors and the socialists, today everyone is pushing the European economic leadership to it.
I agree.
But if you imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it suggests to the citizens - it would be a new madness and a further sackgase.
We need to take a new stage of European construction on us.
In order to make the Republic arise in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of the interests alone could not make enough here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the 2011 year would end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most portable segment is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or purchase settlement by simply keeping the card on a reader.
Over the 320 million uncontact cards sold a year ago, 460 million uncontact cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe has gained contactless payments on the ground after the Asia-Pacific region has long been rejected.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to cross higher speeds, it is now necessary that banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematicly deliver bank cards to their customers in the future with contactless chips," said Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile
However, this is just a first step on the way to the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
A slightly low percentage of devices has been yet equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) required to carry out these transactions.
"They're delayed."
“But at least next year they should experience a real upward development.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking initiative.
Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test course in Caen, which will expire from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are designed to be equipped with a capsule that allows contact-free payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale yesterday said to prepare the market introduction of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly via mobile.
Terrorist Front understands from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sekte.
The long suspicious relations between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Vice-Auveen Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algeria has now gained "certainty" about it.
“The way both organizations act, as well as the relationships of the secret services indicate clear cooperation,” he explained without continuing to go into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
Investigations on the deportation of two French in Niger held in January have promoted interfaces day by day.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, have been killed on the following day as well as several of their kidnappers in the event of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the trombs at the site of use.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the conducted telephone calls leads to several speakers stationed in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long stayed in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the wall of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but you have to wait for clearer evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
"It's thoughtable."
“You have been aware for years that the sect is concerned with financial and intellectual support from Auven and that it is increasingly active,” Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
Over the past few months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as Boko Harem's responses and operational modes, which now indicated the addition of suicide bombers and the use of ever more complex explosives that wear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has been pressured on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping for a long time as a community of illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Quick Success
Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the surroundings of a mosque, a school, and fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, which means in Haoussa as much as "western education is a shame" follows the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger experiences rapid successes.
She politicizes and demands strict compliance with the Sharia, while her member activists engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in visibility.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active with their reinforced attacks on the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city and counts 800 deaths.
The incarcerated Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its Hochburgers in the north.
Last Christmas she met herself for an assault in Jos, which called for 80 people’s lives, and then for another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is accused of a suicide bombing that occurred in the secured police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will prioritize international targets.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has worried all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have occupied the Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko Harem, and was ready to show him "to share substantial indications."
The World of Republican Presidency Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplifying and unknowledge about China, Iraq, as well as providing assistance for Israel.
Can a weakened America lead a complex world with simple not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates so, the voters could almost get this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their co-controvers have repeatedly made their deterrent statements as well as their statements on Auven policy, traditional Republican focus.
China, Iran and Israel’s help fall – often in no way undermined – slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course, Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to cite before the WTO and denounce them of the "currency manipulation" - leading theme in an America that is irritated by the migration of all industries to Asia at the top.
It was stupid if this would imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have a mature vision of Auven politics, has almost disturbed the air with regard to his emotions-distorting atmosphere.
He had called for a hand-resistant but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (also Obama’s current attitude).
But Huntsman is not heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion surveys.
Reagan's similar image
Romney also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions should fail to stop the nuclear program.
"If I'm going to be elected, I command Iran content," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will get the bomb.”
Moreover, he promised Israel’s strengthened military assistance and accused Obama of being guilty of commitments to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest positioned candidate, is, on the other hand, a shameful documentary ignorance.
Recently, he urged the Chinese military threat to counter as Beijing "developed a nuclear power attempt" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, insists on being willing to serve the US army in Mexico against drug cards.
The 2009 Obama banned use of torture attacks against alleged terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry, and the Michele Bachmann candidate.
You are far away from John McCain, Republican candidate in 2008, a heavyweight of Auvenpolitics.
Against the current presidential contractors, Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to drink water in his wine about the anti-terror issue.
They stand right on the failure of his naive conversation with Iran, the former withdrawal of his "young" from Iraq, his uncertainty in Libya, which also led him to the reputation of weakness.
However, this appreciation is not so unforcered.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has disabled.
Since Iraq, she has been protecting itself from military interventions that lead to relaxation.
And Obama is more reasonable by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to raise his leadership position to a new life.
North Stream, new door to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea ground and connects West Europe directly to Russia, has been operated.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gazprom wanted to do this event with glance and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four heads of state and government, have visited at the Baltic Coast last Tuesday under orchestra decommissioning and at a fine-taste buffet of the introduction of the new gas stream Nord Stream, which directly connects Russia and Germany under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolized the taxation of the valve, which brings the Russian gas into the western European network.
With the new gas transmission, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year will be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1.224 km length connecting the region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline that allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third line is already made on the route itself.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual finishing of this huge construction works like a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, avoiding any trajectory through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries lose some power: it will now be harder for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest involved in the debate, was not backed up to compare the Northern Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater supply security by supporting this Russian project.
This, however, is at the expense of European energy, as the project has beaten a breakthrough between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries with strong gas consumption and their gas agreements.
"This gas transmission is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed in the introduction of the gas transmission, pointing to the extent that the gross gas contracts are also important from political and economic sides.
All this explains the wide smile of the numerous gasprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel with concrete sealing that is intended to protect it from vessel nuclei.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m deep.
During their construction, the mining fields dated from World War II had to be balanced.
"Two hundred mins had to be removed or destroyed in the midst of the war," said Jens Müller, spokesman of North Stream.
Moreover, reinforced mappings had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The wire is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which has been interrupted over the entire length by nothing: either through valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project managers took away from it, as the Swedens were little excited to see a Russian state society permanently settling on its coastal level.
"In case of an accident, we close the gas emission in less than a minute," said Jens Müller.
Thus, in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas duct will be removed into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers as only unlikely, as the welding threads were estimated to be durable from a leak every 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by a subwater robot controlled for external observation purposes by a sea ship as well as by a device circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigarette, miβt a meter in diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moves through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the wiring at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any metal deformation when it arrives.
The gas transmission was designed to operate for fifty years, without having to be subjected to the least repair.
Gas circulation is easily guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance, 100 bar at the exit.
Five companies have united their forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, there are German companies E. ON and BASF (each of 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gassunie and the French company group GDF Suez (each of 9%).
These five companies have formed a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly affordable.
Gazprom has then rented the entire capacity of its gas transportation on an extendable 20-year contract.
"Gasprom will be paid for the total capacity, no matter how gross the actual transporter gas volume is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas transmission building was secured by 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For example, for GDF Suez, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are forced to recover their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas transmission occurs at a sandy, forested coastal cliff at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas exit speeds.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before being redirected to the German gas streams.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
It was launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, and Moleskine now wants to re-educate the writing style.
It has a flair of adventures, spent hours with writing at candlelight.
Moleskine’s notebook is easily recognisable, with its black rectangular belt, its rubber belt, the egg-colored sides, as old over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, headquartered in Milan, decided to put a distinctive design notebook on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then expert advisor of the company, is responsible for launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an elderly production technique called Mole Skin (maulwurfshaut), which is called a cotton coat, for example used for bonds of poster benches.
This type of notebook was very questioned among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has restored an old and almost forgotten object that until the 20th century was considered an icon of avantgardist artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established with a sale of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notes were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is executed in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a fantasy image of the buyer as the notebook enthusiasts both business people and students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultural and public customers.
The small, Italian company, who had 12 employees at its beginnings, employs now over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notes in book stores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and agrees to implement its identity.
"We have followed the spirit of time and his new writing needs, which exists despite the surrender of emails," Maria Sebregondi said.
This cultural drawing is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently the brand has launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notes.
In August, the company also introduced a band with leopard patterns at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural time spirit and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer helmets... The brand features the entire range of articles.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, and thus introduced a new chapter in Moleskine’s history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the ‘15th week of work for disabled people’.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average value: 19% against 9% of the total population unemployment.
Disturbance?
"No," said Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, who directs the "Work Week for Disabled."
“The progress made within 15 years is significant.”
“The unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high.”
“Not yet, there is still a lot to do.”
However, it must be said that there are still numerous obstacles to disabled unemployed people before they get a job.
More frequently, the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abiture and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education degrees.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to restart work, and that form the core of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, which helps companies to acquire disabled jobs.
So much about the real brakes.
But avoid profane and profane arguments, which are slowly and slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité reported that the investigated managers had "a weak level of knowledge about disabled persons" which "overrepresented" was "of persons in rolling chairs, mentally or intellectually minor".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a broad way to achieve the employment goal of 6% of disabled employees, as set out in a 1987 law.
These last figures, from 2008, refer to a quota of 2.6%.
“We are now at 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization responsible for making contributions from companies that violate this law.
The proof: The number of "fees paying" establishments has also decreased as the amount of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, which is amounting from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies," Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also brings true knowledge, especially in the major corporate groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the businesses employed between 20 and 49 employees with disabled employment, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Already before the Blue Friday evening (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not hidden their pleasure, which gave them the game of friendship.
It would be too widely caught to claim there was a secret agreement between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Sitting on the side of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard were able to close peace well and gladly.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgium."
"I want to look forward," the native liller assures.
With regard to the contrast between his performance in the club and Nationalelf, “It is a unit that justifies everything.”
“I’ve been in Lille all year round what’s not the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought here on Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France, to finally "to shine".
However, without leaving the note of "please".
The French national team has fired since the age of seven, leading his winning field trains between 1998 and 2000.
“I was always supported,” he confirmed.
This will necessarily contribute to further strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Matthew (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he said.
“We’ve just walked the way.”
“To be allowed to play is a big luck!”
Leekens, on the other hand, let the "Stolz" blame with goodness.
"The pride of having a galamatch."
"Stolz" also confirms - in its own characteristic as "neighbours" - that France" again has become a team at a very high level," and that a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc has done good work,” he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, the technician will probably see the plane sharing with the blue (French National Elf) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians come out groove," he stressed.
“We’re planning one thing, players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice that in the upcoming games." The game involving France.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento sees with great optimism the replay against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams had missed the facts in the game.
At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and especially a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no smaller attack of doubt that La Selecçao, his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to serve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the game (0-0) on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the worms have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party for more than an hour clearly, but the team was unable to press the matter so important that it would have taken the pressure from her.
“This is a good result, but it provides a certain risk because we haven’t achieved an external storm.”
However, at home, in its bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they are going to go through a public that is likely to be even hot on the game, even if the party was, of course, announced as "very little"," said the optimistic but clear Bento.
“We expect a very little match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the top,” the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
“We continue to have a 50% chance to participate in the 2012 European Championship,” Carlos Queiroz said.
The uncertainty in Bosnia on Friday forced the Portuguese to achieve and win a door.
An uncertainty can already be enough for the Bosnians who also need a door.
“This is a good result, but it provides a certain risk because we haven’t achieved an external storm,” Bento regrets.
"We're going to fight against a team that has high technical qualities and has a lot of individual players," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese had already predicted to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnian at the beginning to "do not give time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time it will be implemented in reality.
