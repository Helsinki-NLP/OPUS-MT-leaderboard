The Prague Stock Exchange falls against business end in minus.
After steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange could correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal day business.
The Prague Stock Exchange immediately at the beginning of Tuesday’s trades began at the rupture of Monday, when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the collapse was at Wall Street.
Also in the Czech Republic, the market's reaction to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Case of stocks in Asia
A dramatic case experienced on Tuesday the stocks on the stock markets in Asia, although the indexes could compensate for some of the losses throughout the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index in Hong Kong lost nearly four percentage points during the business day, but later could play part of the losses, thus reducing the decline to approximately 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which observed the movement of Chinese stocks at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, decreased by 3.8%, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stocks on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but then decreased the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan declined by 3.6% after the index.
“The time for the U.S. rescue action is unsafe and will affect the financial markets worldwide,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, so regardless of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should return to the negotiations table as soon as possible and approve the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the collapse.
A blood bath of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected on Monday the plan to support the financial system for spending up to $700 billion (fixed 12 billion CZK).
The legislators ignored President George Bush’s request to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the basic causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
The U.S. shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main share indexes recorded the biggest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index decreased by nearly 7 percent, a similar invasion he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had declined before the vote, but there were hardly signs that the draft would not pass through the House of Deputies, the index had experienced a free case.
Congress approves: US government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
It will be voted on the beginning of next week.
In talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid for the U.S. financial system in a range of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), the U.S. legislators reached a breakdown.
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
In fact, Congress Members have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final drafting of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the U.S. Congress on Monday.
This was said on Sunday by the President of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, according to various reports, it is likely to be voted on the plan earlier on Wednesday.
According to economists, a statement that the plan is adopted should be the first important psychological factor for promoting the financial markets.
However, afterwards, it comes to a "development" due to the complex mechanisms, how to help the markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have achieved significant progress.
“We have clarified our different views on how a market stabilization package should look,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of Bloomberg.
According to them, a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of non-sales mortgage assets from financial companies, which threatens financial companies to fall into serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
“We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must be effective in the market too.
“We need to continue the health plan, but I think we’re on the target,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Businesses
The global financial crisis is also significantly falling into the stock markets that fall strongly.
According to Nevada’s Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are striving to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
In fact, there is a desire to calm investors in front of trades on the Asian financial markets that are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could influence the trades on Monday.
However, it is still unclear when both Houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, there is also unclearness on whether the negotiations in the last minute could still fail.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will still experience some changes.
The total amount for the aid of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be prepared as soon as possible, as President George Bush said.
However, the Congress can block the expenditure of the rest of the money if it feels that the program does not fulfill its function, for another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates positive progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote for its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remains based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've developed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
The U.S. President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “approved both side-by-side efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden fall screen
The President of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the leading trader, stated that lawmakers had agreed to have a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of benefits and a schedule for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden screens for directors of societies involved in the programme and establish a committee to be under the supervision of the Fund.
This is to be led by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on it and made a big progress towards a deal that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects aid for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgage purchased by the government, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for the debtors and allowing them to maintain their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“And that’s why you don’t know through what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government will divide the losses to each other,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is to be adopted now or early next week, Marek believes it is not crucial.
“A lot more important is that Congress members agree to support the plan and say goodbye to him as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that it comes to adoption is the most important at this moment,” Marek said.
Duell on Messers Cutter: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you when you choose
While almost any mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still phone.
That’s why it looks like it’s better to buy only one phone.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of reasons why you should apply to an independent player.
The choice depends on the type of use and the claims to the future owners.
Of course, it’s hard to buy a great expensive plate player at home to listen to the latest album by Maxim Turbulenc.
Once, such musical news do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you are likely to dream of at least one such.
This is the same with music on travel, i.e. compressed music, simplifyed - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floyd fan will probably hardly push headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is widely stored.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music player can play much more than just music, but what mobiles can do doesn’t even make it clear.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calling and sims, it can play music and videos, both, it has a better one, a worse one camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communications, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill or photograph a TV.
But the universality of the phones also brings downsides.
The more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to load it.
Playing music is one of the biggest energy feeders.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-two hours, usually much less.
In this regard, Music Player (especially the easiest) is significantly more powerful.
Therefore, with cheap mobiles, you should expect that they can’t play music for more than a few hours.
If you are then calling on and on, you prefer to buy a charger for your office for safety - that is also true for more expensive devices.
In MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good keeping at least 9 hours continuous operation with one time charging.
Another problem is if you want to overplay music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small portion of the devices has a USB shutdown, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without a specific software.
Of course, you can play music directly to a memory medium, but only a few card readers will be finished with the small memory cards used on mobile phones without reducing.
For players, you don’t need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You just need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves set up a music library, arranged by the interpreter's name, the title of the album, the genre, or for example the user's review.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles can more
When choosing a concrete device, you should learn in particular about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the comfort of operation.
If music is mainly funny for you and you just listen to it every day, for example, on the street, then a mobile phone is enough to play MP3 files.
What almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t have to control differently what music formats a mobile phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most music you get will be in this format.
The format is one of the most common ones, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You just need to call the appropriate pages of a provider (or another provider) on the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for yourself about why you should apply a music towel.
Unfortunately, the provider’s offer is bad and is usually limited only to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this kind of sale of music (because it is via GSM, the Internet or the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you are carrying headphones or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can access the integrated speaker, which has almost any mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music gloves will be in price for many.
The cheapest usually costs less than 3,000 krones.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap will be for most that there are no normal headphones.
The best and technically advanced phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is in easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily the cheapest (see selection) player can really use anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity when operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
There is no collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile internet and a subsequently terrifying account for data transfers.
What device should you now catch
Also the cheapest phones (e.g., Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are worth.
But attention.
Base models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then go to Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB), you will need to put no more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the most challenging listeners, you prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3, and the user comfort comes to one single MP3 player.
The most common is here Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the single-selling MP3 player.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand krone, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will provide you with MP3 player from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to Czech Republic this year.
Or maybe
The mobile channel market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, which Czech providers offer almost all services as well as those offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe he won't wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers are working on the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported it at Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed by the telecommunications agency ČTÚ, which noted that the price of a SMS here is higher than the rest of the European Union.
According to the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming fees, it is so likely to be a paradoxal situation - for some of the Czech mobile providers, SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
Why are the prices in Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it is lacking the competition that really makes a fighting announcement.
It may sound paradox, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of much more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile providers are pleased to shine on the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past often expressed that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (although he would probably not even find any frequencies).
However, there is another possibility - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile phone market led to a significant price drop, to which the classic mobile phone providers also had to respond.
There were still similar voices in the UK before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market.
However, it has been proven that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
You don’t need to look for examples for a long time.
In February, we reported this about the launch of the virtual provider mobilking in Poland.
In just one year and a half, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country’s fifth largest provider.
Behind mobilking is the Penta financial group owned in Czech Republic, among other things U:fon.
The advantage of virtual provider is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a fairly good shake to put on a non-climbing target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say if a similar concept could be seen in Poland as well as in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav Čepický’s press speaker also doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, he is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer.”
In the Czech Republic without chances, the mobile phone providers
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile service provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobileking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
It is more likely to enter the market by mobilking in other countries of our region,” said Janna Studničková, the press spokesman of the Penta Financial Group in a telephone conversation.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile providers in the Czech Republic are not unauthorized in this regard.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that there is no potential competitor.
Your interest in starting a virtual mobile service provider has long been showing the GTS Novera group who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of company customers.
“We are very interested in providing our customers not only with fixed networks but also with mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this option with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, the press spokesman of the Group.
Maybe there are better times now.
Non-official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far, it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“Now we do not expect that there is room for a fully virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifications compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has discussed us with a complex and confident project in this area,” says Vlastimil Sršeň from Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also indicate the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová, in rare consonance with the O2 statement, added: "In the meantime, we have not yet found a viable and both-sided project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds, "In the network of T-Mobile will hardly appear by the end of the year a virtual provider.
At this moment, we should already have a concrete offer to be able to think so short-term.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: “For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
That’s what we consider from the customer’s perspective as the best.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The action of mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider calls more competition, which would lead to lower prices and thus to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor make it easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can draw on a strang, when it comes to something, also the long hin and her point to the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came at the time when U:fon came into the market, out of the company T-Mobile.
This also shows publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is right as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile phone provider.
Given the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor would put high demands on the market itself and, in particular, its services."
However, in view of this approach of the mobile providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprised.
It is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It owns exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, refers to all of this problem, to its very typical attitude.
The entry into the market would then be possible after a contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider has been concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded as the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not interesting enough for the classical providers,” said Kristián Chalupa from the UOHS Department of Foreign Relations.
Of representatives of the providers, such a formulation would not be surprised.
This is more than suspicious from an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, ensures that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the country where virtual providers work quite normally, it is necessary to observe that their market access has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market is likely not one of the interests of ÚOHS.
In this case, it is really shocking that the almost already ongoing conformity of the three mobile providers resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it really is just an accident is on hand.
As well as the absolute same gasoline price in the gasoline stations is surely only the accident and the consequence of a harsh competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of action against competition in this matter, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile phone market for virtual providers are also likely to lack the telecommunications regulatory authority,” Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by ČTÚ, that telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition are a single market.
In such a market, of course, no one of the Czech mobile service providers has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always necessary for a virtual provider to enter the market.
And the mobile service provider has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that in a particular segment he necessarily assumes a dominant position.
Even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile providers will act in a similar manner.
The complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they face very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The removal of responsibility for the ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distants itself from the whole issue.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to implement the newly adopted Telecommunications Act’s expansion of ČTÚ’s competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of professionals had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS just need to know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's going to be when no one looks
Without prejudice, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies that spend their own pricing lists for mobile telecommunications services, but are only partly public.
Normally, it is a business that operates in the field of multi-level marketing.
For example, your own mobile phone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come from selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile service providers prohibit a similar type of re-sale.
“If there are cases you describe, it can be a violation of the contractual conditions that we will then deal with, which can lead to a cessation of cooperation with the corresponding society,” Martina Kemrová said.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not occur with the operators of the mobile service providers.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator objects to such action.
Because from the activities of these companies, they do not have negligible profits, at the same time, they are not affected by actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický notes possible problems: “The law allows such speculations, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card does not run on their phone on their name, so they can’t fully have it like the normal customers of the mobile providers.”
However, at least this would have to happen strangely.
Another question is also open for the UOHS.
The mobile phone providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that ÚOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not, it does not have to agree with the statement of the providers, they would know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been emphasized several times in the text, the entry into the market of virtual providers led to a significant price drop in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers are created, the classic providers are trying to prevent their emerging virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a too small or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulators intervened right now, which in no way attempted to keep the interests of the mobile providers, but the interests of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory organs throw the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot eliminate the impression that unclearness in the competences in these cases is more than affordable.
But we do not throw the flint into the wheat.
If the background information is voiced and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon be re-entering.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (discriminating).
And then the Czechs won’t finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the day of Czech nationality, presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my home country.
The hymn was replayed by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or soft solo songs, in chorfacing and in an instrumental version.
The Gesangsfassung took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions immediately.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech radio that he had chosen for the solo-variant singers with young, representative voices that are marked and popular.
“From the beginning, I have tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well so that you can create a coherence,” the director said.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The Song Kde home my first erklang in 1834 on the stage of the stalled theatre in the original Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music derived from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first strofe of the song then became an organic part of the national hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven symbols of state remained also after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
Prague transport companies are also transported on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of Prague transport companies will be entered as a date when the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket will be entered into a subway, train or bus.
These can now be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own the chipcard Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and play it at the same time on their chip cards, namely in the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Museum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Kośby, Roztyly and Letňy.
The coupons have also been available on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the edition window at the subway stations where they had to wait regularly for their paper cards in long snakes so far.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the Open Card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places there is also a switch with trained staff available to travellers, which advises the stakeholders when purchasing the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said Martin Opatrný, spokesman of the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the open cards, which are fitted in some subways.
How do such machines look like?
They are red, reminded of ticket ratings, the passengers may have already noticed in the subway stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are now five of them in the city, but it will be eighty until the end of the year,” Opatrný added.
The coupon controls an automation instead of the driver
The operation of the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You just need to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons apply from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
Thus, on the pre-city trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region of central Böhmen reach the capital.
"In the trains integrated into Prague traffic, train trackers have readers to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," said Philip Drápal by Ropid.
The front buses have card readers at the box at the driver.
The chip card must be displayed not only to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked location on the side of the box.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the matched coupons.
"When a passenger wants to check the validity of the recorded coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not ride by buses and no longer knows when the coupon’s validity ends can go back to the self-service machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here is the information on the validity of its documents on the display of the device.
The Sudetens Request a People's Decision from the United States
In 1945, the Germans of Sudeten had asked for the englishment of the Bohmer Forest to the United States.
This is based on a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemia scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the rule of the United States of America.
With such a desire, in 1945 a number of groups of Sudeten Germans had turned to the U.S. Presidents.
This is based, among other things, on a letter contained in a private archive, which is stored today in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the US President not to allow the return of the "Sudetengus" - which was adopted on the basis of the Munich Agreement by Hitler - to the Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units enter not as oppressors and enemies of German territory but as liberators,” he said in a letter signed with the words “People for whom the fate of the Sudeten is at heart.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - informing the Czech national character - suspect that they would expect brutality, ignorance, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US Presidents, for today and forever, the protection of the Bohmer Forest.
“We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of millions of residents of this territory, you agree to a foreign state who has oppressed and tried to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allied,” the letter reads.
The reason why the writers cannot sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance of the " Czech oppressors".
If the President of the U.S. doubts about the mood of the Bohmer Forest Germans, it is enough to initiate a folk decision in the Bohmer Forest if the residents wanted to be part of the U.S. or live under the protective rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of the post-war history may sound somewhat naive, it, in the opinion of some newspapers, draws a good picture of the expectations of the Germans at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to assume that they would be negotiated about their departure from the Republic, only a few of them agreed to such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and the UK to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, originating in Budweis.
He was used in the war as Budweiser German in the navy at the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war and was taken into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czechs would pass them," Chalupa said.
None of the German war prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia had, in his opinion, expected it to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign addresses drivers
First action on the safety of the streets in Czech history.
Also, the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday was characterized.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s authority promises to take drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, internet, and also on flyers.
It is intended to take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol on the control.
And you also remember to climb yourself before travelling.
The campaign aims primarily to speak to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians, and not least to professional motorcycle drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who call on emotions.
This is also the "blood" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in big letters on a marker shield.
And in a blood vessel, the word "paying".
This means that you can pay a moment of dissatisfaction with your own life.
The spots will "shock" the spectators by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see quite normal images with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It promises that the numbers of accidents and the number of traffic threats will fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peit for the drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is subject to sugar bread and peitsche.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when you ride in red, you save time.
The pest is then the threat of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” said the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And therefore, information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, the psychologist says.
Even less effective, according to his opinion, tables that make the drivers aware of a danger.
“If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon float with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer perceive them,” says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The President of the Provisional Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, if in exchange peace can be concluded with Palestine and Syria.
He stressed this in an interview that was printed by the newspaper Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We maintain a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to drop a similarly high percentage to Palestinians (Israeli territories) because there will be no peace without that,” he added.
He agreed that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and especially do not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs as it has happened to one of my best friends will have to leave a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in a statement on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Premier, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temples and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won’t work,” he continued.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert spoke for the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Highs, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
This would also require some effort on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone and alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," said Olmert.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to give up to return the Golan Highs.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Chiitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to renounce the permanent support they have to renounce to the terrorism of the (Chiitic) Hamas movement, the terrorist network of Al-Qaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know it, in a remote bus it is not allowed to run
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus from the company Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can go and run by bus during the journey.
“If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the road traffic law,” said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which a 20-year-old Stewardess died last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at the moment in all the disasters next to the driver, where she was at least safe in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or a sharp brake at the moment, when the Steward produces coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces after the car letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, travellers must sit.
Student Agency's remote buses have no parking spaces; what the company's director Radim Jančura confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
“We talked about this with the ministry, and this did not agree to the movement of travellers first.
It was later taken back, and we have reached a consensus that allows travelers to go to the toilet when they have their seat,” he said.
The law does not know Steward
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward – no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there are also no legal provisions that prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of vehicle accompanying; however, its rights and duties do not define it," said Hanzelka’s spokesman.
On the contrary, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law subsequently covers this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has parking spaces in the product authorisation.
That’s all,” he emphasized.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are parking spaces and the maximum speed is limited, nearby buses with parking spaces and a higher permitted speed and buses without parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on traffic safety, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid driving mode, there are no many threats, the situation is comparable to the service on a plane.
It’s not sure when turbulences come, and the stewardess can hit the head.”
“But if a bus is sharp, then naturally the laws of physics also apply.
Just as in the city bus or in a railroad.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal regulations,” he says and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company that offers services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider his career to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that Steward's profession is risky, I'll delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers when they arrive.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in security, Asiana director Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of Stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We have no stewards food, but we are starting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with a deadly accident,” he had not expressed for Týden.cz a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In an accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was defeated who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably been disconnected from the stop strip and had shut down the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
That the two places had been sold for the Stewards, Jančura argued.
"These places cannot be reserved in remote connections, they are blocked."
The company will complain about truck drivers.
With compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait for the court judgment, but she expects a financial damage compensation from the blameless as well.
A law amendment?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of Stewards’ movement on a bus could bring a legal regulation in which a 30-headed team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
“This has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the highest speed on the highway and the use of mobiles when driving,” said Hořín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider Stewards’ activities to be something that could significantly endanger the safety of passengers,” said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and labour protection authorities.
Dusseldorfer Hope rests in Frankfurt
In great words, it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB Board to the employees of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf monetary institute with the Frankfurter Deka Bank, it is possible to create "the central capital market house of the Sparkasse Financial Group", according to the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB incorporated a "competence block" with sustainable yields in such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be a crucial incentive for further fusions in the national banking sector.
This is how a board wants to demonstrate actionability in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under great pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Institute, which the Northern Rhine-Western National Government has recently clarified the time to find a future solution.
A common connection between the Deka-Bank, which customers know for their investment funds, and however the WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on the side of Frankfurt.
Although Deka-Bank Chief Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the half-year numbers at the end of August, in a fusion of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he did not see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deca, which will be held by half of the national banks and savings associations, has the Board of Directors ordered to conduct conversations with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or part of it.
The talks have been, as it is said in the financial place, just started.
From the Deka Bank, which is among the most important employers at the Frankfurt Financial Square with its 3,000 employees, it is not the first time to talk about consolidation in the cash sector.
In 2003 it looked as long as the Deka Bank could merge with the National Bank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing has been made from this triangle.
When the plans had become public, the Hessian national government was opposed to the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have always been thoughts about the connection of the Deka Bank with national banks.
However, Günther Merl, the head of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, the knowledge seems to be mature that a combining of the different houses of the public-law sector does not.
After the country’s election in Bavaria is over, the BayernLB could first get closer to the Baden-Württemberg Landsbank.
This is not necessarily a good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to further fusions increases, the partners will continue to do so.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far had a much better financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A meeting with the West LB on the other hand, the Hessen-Thüringen savings- and giroverband, who participated in the Helaba, proposed a rigle at the beginning of the year.
Let's stay in the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, it is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses match each other.
In June Merl expressed the crucial question with which business model to ensure the future of national banks has not been answered by the German Savings and Giro Association.
In the end, there could also be a breakdown of the West LB, which is not self-desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the Board of Directors there is the speech about it, it will certainly be striving for a "complete solution" for the house.
How this can be put under a hat with the conjunction of individual units with the Deka Bank will still be shown.
The second week is known as "Italian Weekend"
For Elena, it’s the first, for Luca, it’s the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with her as her girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
A massively built gardener stands behind them in the five-liter beer-facing of the Kaiser brand and proves to the 200 Octoberfest travellers how deep tones can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca only a knife, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking place next to the train station Puorta Nuova, starts this evening at 23.45 p.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della bera", arrival expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, traveling in a bus only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says that is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long shirt with pelzimita food and a glass with wide silver bubbles, includes the buses.
For five years, they have been on October, three tours are alone this year.
In the evening, on the Wiesn, back at 22.30 p.m.
Staying at night would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
€75 is the cost of the trip, the welcome trip with Kaiser-Beer, devoted faithfully to the Bavarian cleaning order, the health insurance and the German-language travel guide - Marco has visited a course of language in Frankfurt - including.
And the buses already roll in the night, on the highway towards "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, travellers sleep.
Well, they will need their strengths.
It will be held in Brixen and wooden churches, where some other buses with Italian signs on the highway 8 just before Munich again.
Finally, when Marcos Group arrives plannedly at the parking lot in the early 7 p.m. near the Theresienwiese, the other 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last question, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in Fracture, along with the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “If the doors go up to the tents of beer, it is running!”, Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow moulds on the same banks, distribute in the room!"
The measure, brown Marco, cost 8.25 Euro.
Don't forget about drinking money.
“Security people show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight, find a half once again here!"
And it's going to be a bitch.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, shelters, and even to the electoral plaque of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It is the second week known as "Italian Weekend".
There is no precise information about the numbers; the speech is about 50,000 who are going through the Alps and falling into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are expected to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteer assistants support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistic, where Italians (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) have the first place with about 200 medical care.
Especially popular among Italians is the court court.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stated the Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
So good that the politician used the word "relative" and also influenced that the German banking sector would not be ignored by the crisis.
Because it was now in the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) noted in the Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to avoid turbulence in the markets.
One person familiar with the situation said on Monday that credit aids amounted to up to €35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should only pay interest to the part it uses as well.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
Background are losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a report, the state financer had refinancing himself in the extremely short term for long-term projects for which he has allocated money – which is no longer possible due to the lack of trust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve was 95 percent scattered to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate was slightly spent from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
The current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, the revenue from awards to claims and certain securities as well as the settlement of reserves in credit transactions decreased by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only due to higher revenue from refunds of post-reserved taxation costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the refund of interest in the taxation order and from the business care for companies, the income minus was still moderate by about 16 per cent.
The former state funder had first speculated with commercial real estate loans that were then divided into the Aareal Bank after privatization in 1990.
Because you were too little earned in the classical state financing, the default had then increased in infrastructure projects and the funding of Community projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now take deductions that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, which is quite uncertain.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
Since 2007, it has been cut by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure funder since the Depfa adoption.
It is more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market than other institutions because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending of the banks has been largely defeated as the banks hold their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires a short-term refinancing portfolio of the default – about €50 billion annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the funding needs of the group are covered with the loan for predictable time, and the company is "protected by the influence of the currently largely functional international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is heard that the funds have secured refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE President Georg Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the cash markets at predictable time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) assume that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s market capacity is now secured.
This is to be hoped for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the funding does not have to be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to scratch.
After late Sunday evening after the bank was still before the bank’s insolvency, at least the temporary rescue could not calm the torturers.
The share rate is 75 percent to €3.30.
However, the debt courses are well maintained.
If priority debts were hardly moving, the courses of postgraduate loans would be clearer.
The debts of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo are mainly affected and understandably the periods of life that go beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-state loans were previously a speculative investment alternative, their value must be considered as depending on the stability of the international financial system, after the significant deterioration of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only entered the house by taking the default.
As long as the banknotes, governments and less affected business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as the pensions can be deducted from a timely eradication.
Or that happens, which is currently hardly hoped for anyone - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the coming 15 months.
However, in view of the reports overwhelming with the partial government, the probability of security has now become just a legitimate hope.
This is especially likely for long-term believers to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate from their commitments.
In any case, short-lived investors may use a termination to form a loss premise for future tax payments on rate gains later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is expected to present himself on the first school day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start watching: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
“The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Before the school, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I didn’t walk.
The beginning of the lesson appears not as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students start at 8 p.m. until nine hours before a short meeting with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson began, I was in the row to present myself.
I’m not the one who likes to talk to people or to a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I wear an old rock of my guest mum, plus blues, blue knees and black leather shoes.
In this elevator, therefore, I stood in front of the pult and tried to pronounce everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, coming from Germany, and I have a week's birthday.
At the moment, I was very pleased that I had started learning the language almost two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all shaken, kicked and knocked, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew it from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I was fastened in my place.
The girl next to me has been pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange schoolgirl should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong shook, I was regularly shaken.
Everyone talked to each other and looked at me and asked me holes in my stomach - it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the pause, all of their bentos are packed out.
My guest mum also made me a lunch box - this is a bit different than the destiny German breakbread.
I had rice with herbs, small worms, salad of gourmets and algues, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofumant.
I usually don’t have a sharp smell of what I’m eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, up to the salty flowers maybe, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she will then make especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer at the break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch it here too.
"Why is Japan calculated?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it's fascinating me now."
I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and culture therein, I also started to learn a little Japanese.
So for me it was quite clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, sitting and habits.
And on that one is putting great value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not yet felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a shell run in danger mean that it also feels fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Many animals have feelings as well.
Just how can you check if they feel the same if they behave like us?
The Internet magazine "Edge" has been published by famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without me or anyone else to prove that so far, where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we should hope at least because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and draw questions of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an inevitable area because the hardware does not conform.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, flees or strikes.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
First of all, the switch circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side-frontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This broad region is much higher in humans than in the rest of the primates and appears to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature may be in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be acquired, may differ very much from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If, as an internal and subjective thing, it is not possible to analyze the specific hardware based on our own experience, our research is facing major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of the conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that would be scientifically easier to access.
You could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and that’s what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, with this approach, Christof Coch and Francis Crick, you rather rely on the neurological correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the arrival of visualisation.
What happens to the feelings?
I remind them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of their own conscious brains.
So what we call “freedom” is the mental state in which we are located when the activity of the brain-located defense system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) demonstrates work memory.
Thus, feelings are closely linked to the regions of the Cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the people.
Related with the linguistic nature, fine attitudes of sensation emerge because with the help of words and grammar, we can differentiate and categorize conditions to assign others to ourselves as well.
On the contrary, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the body sensation regions of the cortex and brain stem result similarly, Jaak Pankseep, which, however, more focuses on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can be involved in cat-transverse sensations.
Purely theoretically, I can’t oppose it, but I think it is uncertain.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably feels like this in both cases: but how can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Does a shark run in danger if it also feels scared?
In my eyes, mere behavioral equality cannot yet prove equality.
Neurological comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain stains, but shaves do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it to people: how did you want to prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other breastfeeders, perhaps even shaves (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings probably differ fundamentally from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress here wins at the neurological level, provided you measure the same in rats and people.
As I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, I don’t know if they exist.
You may think that's too short, but I'd rather go ahead than run against a wall constantly.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Mercy deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UFO’s decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there’s still much to do in both countries.”
In the timetable for the construction or rebuilding of stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
The number of EM stages may even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at the highest speed now,” Ukrainian alliance president Grigorij Surkis said.
"The UEFA will keep us in mind constantly."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by independent manager Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals.
The Commission was meeting at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is “the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several first lilies were condemned alone in the last season for manipulation for forced decline, eventually even the start of the league had to be moved in short term.
Emperor Dennis Quaid hits back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about privates - and now she has trouble with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outete her deceased Dennis Quaid as a spouse.
He shame - and hits back.
Late Rose War at the former pair Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have a beautiful fight with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan said in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has been found only after the divorce.
The cause of the soul strike was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s response to his outing as an unfaithful husband seemed clear: “It’s amazing,” the 54-year-old of the New York Daily News said that “I repeatedly recurring and contemplating the history of our relationship.”
It is also "unfortunate" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is "publicly recalled the pain and conversions that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since his divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become the father of twins.
And thus he concludes his inputs with the side hip: "My life goes on at least.
I’m glad I’ve had a wonderful family that’s going best.”
Prices for flight tickets and hotels drop down
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a recent study, flights were even 50% cheaper in Germany.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more affordable - this is the result of a study of travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after a price rise in the first quarter, observed a significant breakdown in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, many nights have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed still increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3.6 percent lower than last year.
Most obviously, the trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year before.
As a cause of this, American Express considers the weak dollar rate that has led to a “decrease travelling pleasure of American tourists”.
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices as industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices have risen by 26.3 percent even record in Europe.
Even with flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still showed up:
Due to the cerosine degradation, travellers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1% more on average than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-term flights were even 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June the price of the economy class tickets dropped by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class prices were much lower.
In Germany, prices increased even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose by 11.9%, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6%.
According to the study, prices have even decreased in German domestic flights.
The reason for price breakdown is, on the one hand, declining economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market broke.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the stressed situation are the deletion of unprofitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had signed the competition in the first half of 2008 – only 24 airlines were in Europe.
HSV hit Gladbach 1:0
With a door and simple methods, the Hamburger SV table guide becomes.
In the Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functioning elf.
Kristoffer Klein expands breakdown for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher arrived late in the game and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she convinced him about the lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second door," said Hermann Rieger at the cabinengang of the Hamburger Arena.
Much was not going on in the catacombes, the half-time break was over and most were sitting back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades physiotherapeut of the HSV, he enjoyed a higher reputation than a number of overwhelmed actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nicked and lifted the dust.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Cheftrainer Martin Jol.
Its command will be left similar: Here with door two!
The implementation remained.
“It wasn’t good to see everything today,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhardt also wanted to "deactivate".
The 1:0 (1:0) has been due to Hamburgers to Mladen Petric's headballer (11); and the fact that very weak gladbackers could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol caught together.
The Hamburger SV is 121 years old on Monday.
The spectators once celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the Arena and the flash table on the video wall, which showed their association as a class premium.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We can arrange that,” Marcell Jansen said.
He knows that the tablely intermediate certificate is more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The crew with its late access – the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric torch, and the Jansen thrown by the FC Bayern – is slow, but it is still unable to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribblings,” Jol said.
After the vote downfall
At Wall Street, fear is going to die.
First news from the failure of the rescue package promptly let the Dow Jones break by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow started something again.
By 20:30, the world’s most important stock exchange barometric score scored about 5 percent at 10,579 counts.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at more than 7 percent in minus at 1548 points.
The biggest loser was at the time in the Dow American Express, who had almost 14 per cent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 per cent.
No title could be added.
Goldman Sachs’ shares decreased by nearly 10%.
Only a few days ago, big investor Warren Buffett was involved in the company.
The rescue plan is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called faulty mortgage papers.
However, the sum is not to be paid on one strike, but gradually.
In return, the State should receive share options from financial companies that could be launched in order to reduce the burden for the State cash.
Share rates in Europe and the United States in downstream
The billion aid for banks in Europe and the United States does not solve the doubts of investors.
The stock exchange rate of the German Grand Bank Hypo Real Estate falls down and breaks down the Dax.

The Dax cleared under the psychologically important 6000-point brand and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went to the knees.
In New York, the Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion heavy rescue package could not be enough to bring the financial markets back into trouble.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hours, or 3.3% to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate voting could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially decreased by 3.2%, the CAC 40 lost 2.9% in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Leitindex Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent after initial wins to 11.743.61 counters.

Dark matter influences the flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been underpinned in research on irregularity: Dark Materie has influenced the speed of space orbits during the so-called Swing-by-Manufacturing.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
For nearly 18 years, the space sonde "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of the frozen fuel pipes soon, you are now at risk of the cold test.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has been creating confusion for years - the Swing-by-Anomalie.
The Swing-by is an air maneuver of spacecraft, where they receive additional vibration in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as Earth.
This allows the sondes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Zone Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sunset Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised for years, however, is that the aircraft do not behave 100 percent as expected under the ancient gravity law.
On the contrary, there are irregularities at speed.
The sondes will be unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicians couldn’t explain this effect.
They called him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts fear that maybe even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by a craving of space, could not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler, from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton, continues to believe that Einstein is not wrong, and attempts to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie using the so-called dark matter that astronomers made in the universe.
“Liability for anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be close to Earth,” he wrote.
From the existence of dark matter, space researchers have not known it for about ten years.
It is evident that it is an attractive force, whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, she is completely invisible, which means she sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes a fifth of the entire mass of the universe well.
Tourists captured in Egypt are free
After ten days in their deportation, the tourists who have moved to Egypt will be free again, as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had requested several million euros of redemption.
Six killers have been killed in a shooting before the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Relief negotiations are already going on.
Germans are always in the vision of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
European tourists flying in the Sahara are obviously free.
This was reported by the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabia and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports of Italian TV broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other prisoners have been released.
We’re just checking their health condition,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are safe and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
It is still unclear the background of a shooting before the prisoners were released: according to an Egyptian security officer, the kidnappers were prepared to stop the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisedly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a redemption,” the official said.
It was "just because of receiving the prisoners" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two of them were arrested.
The prisoners had requested a ransom payment of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the prisoners.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, referring to a German mediator, delaying the release of the prisoners because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female kidnappers after paying the redemption.
The men should be arrested as long as the kidnappers have a safe fool.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
The abuse of Stephen's father "leads to suicide"
The decades of abuse by her father has led to the murder of a woman, a court reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court of Truro found out that he regularly arrested his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was five to seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: “I feel responsible for her death.”
The court found that Mrs. Randle died at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her and tied her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a hospital.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked much of her time in honor for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a jealous surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and “have abandoned her life.”
In April 2007, her true father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by stirring herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the father of his daughter, who wrote a letter of approval, ending as he said, "I made it tied up and linked her eyes."
“I didn’t need them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: “They are an extremely challenging fetish, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be injured before the court if she hadn’t done that.”
He added: “I understand the impact, according to Stephanie’s father and mother’s description, had her actions on her daughter over the years.
Otherwise she would clearly have been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC reported that the cabinet official who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged according to the "public security law".
The man was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were transmitted to the BBC before they were issued to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intention.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that it would be done with the internal defense ministry and cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be named shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highest sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secretariat Committee.
The documents he issued contained classified reviews about Al-Qaida and the capacity of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B costs in eye
British housing companies could cost more than £80 million in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided £14 billion to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Societies (BSA), said it was "intolerant" that companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are paid.
However, the interest rates raised in the meantime will be calculated every year for those 700 financial companies who accept deposits.
The financial services compensation program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies are included in this number.
It’s bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions who were far less carefully.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that companies had to pay together about 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest rates for the loan will be £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to get £81 million for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Construction Companies, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted prudently during the real estate settlement will now be called to bear some of the costs of those institutions who were much less prudently.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
The interest rates that will be paid in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, interest rates will be paid for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both side organizations without partners, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk gets five pens per liter more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pens per liter from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence rise in February, and comes after investigations have been conducted by an advisory company.
Retailers should decide themselves whether they want to share the price rise to their customers.
Before the price rise in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk changed last in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh Rejects Deposit
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a deposit appeal from former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said the court refused to charge 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several sealing charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month against deposit.
Sheikh Hasina will return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, urged the military-based transitional government to first give her complete freedom.
The correspondents say that although their emergency was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is unclear, as part of their release, whether they will be able to stay free if they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers state that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's deposit requests because it says she has no need to receive a deposit since she's already on a delay to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court.”
Their lawyers claim that they need a deposit to return from abroad to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th, said a Awami-Bündnis party headquarters Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Scheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia denied all charges against themselves.
Fear of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations conducted a vaccine program in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a spokesman of the United Nations, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise of not attacking or obstructing thousands of vaccinated employees.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competitive ITV broadcaster.
The competition court ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to under 7.5%.
The Commission had previously argued that BskyB's share was distorting competition and allowed it to have an unpleasant impact on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by renaming NTL, now in Virgin Media, successfully hindering the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB made doubts on the independence of the ITV, which led the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Offcom Communications Office have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing pressure on its share of ITV was an unreasonable and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Prosecutor’s Office
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to address the termination of nine attorneys in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, which criticized the actions of administrative staff.
The report criticized the White House officials, lawmakers and former prosecutor-general Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the concerns that lawyers were suspended for political reasons.
Specialist investigator Nora Dannehy now wants to clarify whether the investigators who were interrogated during the investigation had lied the investigators to hinder justice.
Serious charges including criminal proceedings have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The calling of a specialist investigator with the power to force the witnesses to declare was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when nine US prosecutors were dismissed by the Ministry of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak employment.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, causing many observers to consider the cancellations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in court persecution of high-range Republican Congress members, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of election fraud of Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are responsible for investigating and tracking cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
Attorney-General Alberto Gonzales, then Chief of the Ministry of Justice, has been dismissed because of the dismissals and has finally settled his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also resigned.
In particular, the General Inspector’s report criticized Gonzales’ role by carrying the “Chief Responsibility” for discharges, giving up his leadership role and showing himself “exceptionally disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including President Bush’s former Chief Advisor, Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rockstar Meat Loaf will be honoured during the music award "Q Award" for his epic hymn "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, next week in London, will accept his special gold prize during the award, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which took nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the awards this year after it has come into the narrower selection in four categories.
The head editor of the Q Magazine, Paul Rees, said there would be some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genus and "Bat Out Of Hell" would certainly be one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years, one of which was a surgery in 2003 due to irregular heart attacks after he broke on stage.
In 2007, he had to cease concerts due to acute necklace inflammation.
Later, he became known that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, sideways and other roads, some of which are famous and some are only comfortable.
However, it is hard to tell even for experienced taxi drivers and long-standing locals where Extra Place is, simply because most people have never heard of it.
This small street is located in East Village and goes from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and rather looks after a dust street than after an actively used roadway.
There are no street pictures as well.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
However, this street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on the First Street.
It wants to rebuild Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
One of the other fans is the long-term neighbourhood, which says she is fascinated by the short street, simply because she is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential building and is responsible for the street, has no interest in maintaining it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have proposed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
However, the committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipal council 3.
“It’s only very little room that has been owned by the city and we want extra place to remain belonging to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that set up the small streets and seats that are intended for a cafe that the company wants to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it would not necessarily own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate these fallen streets and make them a public meeting point," she said and added that the city itself had suggested sales.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection, said that it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and emphasized that the department’s task was to develop the property rather than manage.
Compared to his colorful neighbourhood The Bowery, Extra Place has kept some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the street received its name in 1802, as a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne, divided between his many children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock memory, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is most likely known as the culisse for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of shrubs, lumps and parts of fixtures, posters, leaves and seals.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public area, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog titled "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of the complaints: a bitter nostalgic look at the devastating city"), published part of the talk about the city story about Extra Place, published in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Extra Place is a small narrow sackgase that even remains dark during the day and is characterized by rosated metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and over-week old newspapers.”
With a few exceptions, the street looked just as recently as one night.
A rat ran through the rear of the street, not far from the door, which previously led to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bundle of outstanding newspapers on the ground.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought of extra place, but suggested that the street could be somewhat polarized.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the rage of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in places that were dark, moisture and eager.
Discussion on two-language education: education in English-language environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, director of scientific staff in Caliphonic Studies and director of educational sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-writer of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school choice".
To respond to the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the probability of successfully finishing school in African American and Hispanic students is lower than in white students” - what is right.
In order to close this distance of performance, Obama’s education plan recommends, among others, a two-language transition phase in education for those who only learn English.
However, the question of Obama is whether his use of two-language training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance to school services.
Take as an example of "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most students are Spanish and come from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
However, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students completed the state exam in mathematics at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 per cent of children from the fourth year of school were assessed as well in English examination.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those that Obama prefers.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on constant control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach to training in an English-language environment, which is exactly what Obama should consider, according to school manager Linda Mikels.
This approach applies to the nearly exclusive use of the English language in the professional course.
Ms. Mikels, who refused the idea of two-language training, told me that the school had had a remarkable success with a student who had come from Mexico just a short time ago.
“It works,” she noted, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the Sixth Street Prep as a model for other schools with a large proportion of Latin American and other students learning English?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easier, but the educational positions within its own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of two-language training) and its own consistent support for two-language training make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the subject by noting that people should stop worrying about the "only English" legislation targeting.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than deny them and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of new concerns about the economy
The oil price has fallen strongly on Monday due to the fears that even the U.S. rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The crude oil terminals at the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the merchandise markets have been shocked by both the financial turbulences on the Wall Street as well as by powerful spinal storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their highest point of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel this month to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors have been worried again on Monday, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that would be the largest in history.
This message was overrated by new concerns that the financial crisis has not yet been completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is planning to purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized Fortis to the European financial groups.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tensioned negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seemed to have failed to live the mood on the markets.
Since the economic situation is further deteriorating, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decrease.
Analysts from the Deutsche Bank have written in a statement to investors that predictions for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become very uncertain.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
From the perspective of the goods markets, we are worried most about the U.S. American virus spreading around the world, especially to China.
The bank’s analysts have corrected their expectations of oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year, and their forecasts for oil and gas price for the year 2009 decreased by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought he would have seen everything after he had been in the last eight and a half years more frequently than anybody else in the Jets shirt.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that before," said Ellis.
After a slim game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to a afternoon when their evolving cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two other touchdowns, once out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
“I haven’t been particularly anxious,” Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were captured, the defending quarterback Kurt Warner separated.
External defender Darrelle Revis started a successful throw and transformed it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and took it off.
Linebacker David Bowens then made a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazyest.
The cardinal had defeated the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game when the Jets opened the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shooting to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points that the jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answer, both because the jets made 21 points in the third quarter without one one, Mangini said, "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third one.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time.”
Exercise Gebrselassie hits his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some have held him for the best long runners of all times after breaking his own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to manage the route of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the win on the flat course at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous score from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has created her 26th world record in her versatile career, where he has reached at least a world championship title on every route from a kilometer to a marathon or has set a world record.
Last month, birth loss released the Olympic marathon in Beijing, due to fear that the air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In nearly ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - the gearlassion has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railroad drivers such as Gebrselasie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long tracks, the record time for marathon has fallen over 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the score 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie reported to the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago and therefore was unable to train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back in-round.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I restarted the training a week ago and had a few concerns today, but at the end everything was great.”
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s rivals from East Africa - that he overly orchestrated his race race, met many of the world’s best marathon stars in general, rely too on racing leaders as if it were a racing race, and set a world record about the race.
However, this criticism does hardly harm the size of genderslases as long-distance runners.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route at 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had left.
A little more than three miles before finishing, Gebrselassie made his last step to get away from Kwambai, who has arrived as second at 2:05:36 and thus improved his final time for almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became third at 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a significant year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all time.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko was surprised to win the London marathon at 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She planned her race by allowing a quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners only, but overcame 30 kilometers later.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third at 2:25:01.
The pride and strapas in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the excavations of the leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the brilliant, loud and gigantic drives, is a quiet city where pride and the complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three crocket spots, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavens, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrim site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are at the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city she describes is and remains – which made her a tourist trip destination by taking her to Florida travel guides, produced by the federal writer project at the time of depression – in many ways a very special place.
Eatonville is so independent, serving and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what happens to him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidency scandal, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion on racial relations, many are still sorry to be observed by outseaders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city resident and a community member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be voted."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and battle.
It is both a historical example of black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the country’s average.
It is, on the one hand, a Hochburg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that people here are both proud and on the hat.
And so right, the concerns about Eatonville's Image actually started with Zora, as all Hurston call here.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from hearts and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in Florida’s travel guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a street leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Prayer like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston reader led Eatonville's first mayor Joe Clarke to store, and then turned into more private affairs.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "the brown-white modern school, with her careful gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and always fits in hours rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston then linked Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabeticism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described the things as they were,” said Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls, by citing the men singing songs about their beauty, full of sexual assaults.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively excentric woman who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston came into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noiseful chevrolet, smoking and dressed with shoes, in a city that is still in her own style of honor.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, while many rejected them.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while screwing in his chair, on a backward terrace looking at the lake Sabelia, where Hurston was probably baptized after.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were captured.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary daughter Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was founded in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous tomb.
There was no great memory celebration in Eatonville, no public readings in large style.
“I don’t think they’ve understood their contribution to the world or heritage in the least,” says Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The tournament came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to place a five-spirited highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-spirited main road of the municipality.
Orlando’s predecessors had already pushed the highway 4 through the west edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hate into the community.
"In this time a bunch of white boys came often and they threw oranges and goods on the people sitting away," Franklin said.
“There was once a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel to force the Supreme Court's request to integrate by designating its decision in Brown's case against the school council as "politing rather than respecting my race."
Today, residents say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group concentration in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youths.
“Black children were accustomed to becoming humble – I remember – they were humbled by his teacher in the morning and they were humbled by his teacher in the evening,” N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and the business director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't care about his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I think there's a cultural club there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
However, the citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons – black authors, actors and artists who oppose prejudice, as they did, with positive self-confidence and statements like: “How can anyone reject the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's nominated grave and began to fight for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the bookstore, and made it part of the American literature canon again.
The remote road project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbours saw them as a rescue.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-purpose remote road lived the city, accelerated the whole at high speed, awakened real citizenship," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Mrs Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
More and more train stations, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is going to church here since 1993, and locals began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new single-storey library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly decorated and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the city centre of Orlando, she can sometimes feel like a backgase in the summer rain, as small as when she was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(They are now 90% black.)
External persons looking for Eatonville’s history and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white and represented by black men in field work - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a brave, self-confidence teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her disabled community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival became larger, a higher degree of home toll was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw his entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better, and as proud, creative and vibrant, and mixed as any other race and nation group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, who is planning to return to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police that may have some help in his opinion.
And even young people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just go through here will think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said recently on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you really stop and look at his story for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
In New York, there is a fluent financial latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were distracted from the newspaper stations and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they would not even notice that they were in a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shocked offices with the glass facades, bankers and fund managers who have the Monopol in New York, every day have the worst horrific working day since the burden collapse of 1929.
The suppliers still shake the metal tea weighs along the civilian stairs and carry tablets charged with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still screw between apartments like human pack animals loaded with the 50 shirts that hang on a yoke-like belt on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for foodstuffs on the front of the citizens on their breakfast bagel and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 16 and 19 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on Thursday afternoon because of all the world’s decline.
Although I decided to put my duty on time on the calm late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branch, about 20 people were already standing with a snake.
Not to the money switches to withdraw or deposit money, but to the customer service switch where customers order checkbooks, tourists ask the way to Macy's shop and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I learned later from Starr, my "personal banking staff with license", were for the same reason as I was.
However, unlike me, they had already picked up their expenses from smaller banks, in places where they went from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had collected money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar to a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that have only one state branches and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks were silent and quiet.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, in competition administration over and as the last Friday of New Yorker went home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion savings in search of a rescue buyer.
In fear of another crash, the office and store employees who stood before me brought their bars to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have had a flowing financial latin over the past few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribal supermarket, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite bank, and Dick Fuld, whose excited Chairman looks like she was talking about a fake colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniform concierge of my home block, came from our usual entertainment themes about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after I visited the bank.
“I have changed, I don’t take any risk anymore.”
Muslim graves damaged during lawsuit in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left judge of the Austrian Right Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams Belak, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They wear paintings in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, passing through a red line.
Police accuse extremists of grave damage at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, recording significant gains in the country's parliamentary election on the same weekend.
In the night of Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun at Linz, according to police.
The criminals scattered Jewish symbols such as David Star on some of the tombs, but criminal officials believe this is a attempt to shake the motive of extremists driven by hate against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" about the news of the graveyard that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country has left right in the last parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the alliance for the future of Austria, which the two large-right parties received nearly 30% of the votes, joined in their election struggle for a strict anti-immigrant law, and some of their voting rights were criticized by opponents as aliens.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, pleaded for a ban on head towels and Burkas and even announced his rejection of food that is commonly linked to Islam.
At his last visit in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these political symbols are a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections and claim that the extreme rights of the country’s political most powerful block indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
External travel locks for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star, who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, has been forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
The judges made a six-month block after informing the controllers that he wanted to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent were granted on Thursday to suspend a foreign travel shutdown after submitting evidence to the judges of Glitter's prosecution for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman of the Court reported: "On Thursday, September 25, police Kent requested the permission at the Ashford Office to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from traveling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not present in person.”
According to the Registry for Sexual Criminals, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
A negligence of the notification of the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or possible location of glitters in the country.
A spokeswoman at Kent Police Unit said, “The Kent police will do everything they need to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“We believe it is easier to control someone who is located in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is a great concern for the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual offenders in the country to minimise any risk that could be resistant to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he wasn’t comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport control and he flew to some and Her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he would return to the UK.
Lastly, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22, and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Officer Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been arrested in the UK for 4 months in 1999 for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is calm and satisfied that Glitter has been dismissed to travel to France and Spain.
‘I welcome the master behind the scene to hold his character’, Günter Brauer, photographer.
No sections, no washing, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flame tanners who abandon the concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxing look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or the expression strength of the hands that are worried because they are not going to enter the scene.
In his project ‘Flamenco-people’, the German photographer Günter Bauer presents theatrely some of the scenes with singers, dancers, and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flame code representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of the photography of Flamenco, `reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is increasing from day to day', explains the artist and makes it clear that 'Flamenco-people' can be 'everyone', 'but if you look at the photos,' the viewer notices that there are no typical images of the pictures.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to communicate passion, sadness, joy, and thus move the audience.
In order to maintain the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the biggest flame comeders with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', made a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image location function of the camera and the existing material, images that remind us of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: ‘Music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day’.
These are not only the dance, the singing, or the instrumental game itself, but the character of the artist, his character, who leads the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous characters in Flamenco include Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became anthology of Flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to take this idea again two years ago and realize it as ‘portraits of the veterans of sport’ (‘SportART project’).
Although the concepts of the project 'Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer's 'it is very nice to photograph people, know them, and put me in their life condition, for a short moment or a longer time.
I think the portrait in the field of photography is the most difficult species.
You meet or hit people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to implement my ideas."
The collection of today’s portraits of Flamenco, entitled ‘Flamenco-people’, is displayed in the gallery of El Fotómata, located on the street called la calle de la Mata, parallel to the street of la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa believes that the Roma, which he just writes, is 'a greatness'.
He still does not know where the act of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project with which he was engaged is ‘a tollfulness’ and ‘all indicates that he should not write the novel.’
‘If I had been confessed, I wouldn’t have done it, but I’m going to do it, and I hope to end the novel, so he concluded his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the best personalities on the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival premium and gives its voice to most attendants, is compared to the old edition of ‘Our mutual friend’ and is seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noted that he had a audience in front of him, which noticed that the Peruvian who had a wonderful memory and great sense of humor was not given enough time to pass everything once again: how his calling to his literacy came to be true, how his work came to be, how his work came to be, how his work came to be, how his work came to be, how his work came to be, how his work came to be, how his work came to be.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that there is 'no way' to measure and where to know if books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a flying experience', emphasized Vargas Llosa, who claims 'overtakes' responsibility for 'better calling' and 'better calling' for the writer'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather didn't seem to be a bit of a sharp crash.
After the announced poultry fighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the poultry poultry feast, with which the feast should be completed in Pozoblanco, was placed on yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the poultry fighter.
Thus, the feast of the constant weather was suspended, so two out of three feasts could not take place.
It rained on Saturday, therefore, that the second intended poultry feast could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore was composed of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who participated in the livelihoods.
There was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same night, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the cow, which he had managed more by galoppy than by his cow fighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but even without fame.
After he had fought so badly, most of the audience responded to his second battle with Buh-ruffs.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was charged with two thousand kilos of Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes 10 years ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the municipality of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen urged the drivers to stop the car, after which they took the escape.
It seemed to have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilograms of hashish.
The police traced her and captured one of the drivers, the 28-year-old, known as A. A. J., as the Baskian Ministry of Interior reported.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and fake documentation.
The incident occurred when the traffic police officers of the Álava region had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape the control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge, and at the moment the drivers climbed out of the car to fly through a country road into a forest area.
The police in the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two, in a car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was captured by the police.
The front of the car was loaded with hashish bands, which were later directed to other police stations for precise laboratory analysis and resignation of the band.
In addition, the officials found that the 'double' marker was not consistent with the marker indicated in the Kfz papers, so an additional arrest was made for fake official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to conduct the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs taken.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., arrested, was brought to a police office and will be presented to the detained judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A Witness has observed how she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, California's traffic police spokesman told the magazine 'People'.
The Witness explained in detail that Locklear ‘by 16:30 he pressed gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking lot, and when she ran back, she caught her sunglasses a few times.’
Something later, the Witness, who initially probably hadn't known the actress, saw Locklear hanging on a nearby road and climbing the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the emergency service because she had 'anxiety to live for Locklears'.
When the police strike arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street, blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials to follow, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug', the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an uncertain substance that could not be determined and brought to a local investigation arrest at 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic, where it was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Lefts will be responsible for the case Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, Chief Coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after being accused of making businesses with families.
In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take responsibility for this,” Llamazares pointed out in what way the party has to do with the one who has been sitting in the municipal council of Sevilla until now.
However, the President of the VL defended the necessity of ‘transparency’ in the possible investigations of the infringements that Silva could have started: ‘The VL always insisted that such cases be maintained maximum transparency.’
With regard to this issue, he emphasized that education has ‘a stringent ethical code for all public officials’.
'Sangre de mayo': Hero book by Garci
Inspired by ‘Episodios Nacionales’ by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in ‘Sangre de mayo’ represents the revised version of the famous Spanish rebellion against the French.
In this way, the Cineast has attempted to represent a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci said in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the actors.
'Songre de mayo' with a film length of more than two hours and a half, will be presented in cinema this Friday and later displayed on the broadcast Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of Galdós’ literature, assures that thanks to this tournament his ‘kindness stream’ went into fulfilment. This is what he owe Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the Autonomous Community Madrid to turn a memory film for the second century celebration on November 2 in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for rotational work, offers Garci, as he added, the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of 'confused Spain', which sought the false leader for the struggle, because the people were made by the struggle for independence and under the guard of the reign of Ferdinand VII.
However, the Cineast regrets that you could not expect financing such as 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as 'Songre de Mayo'), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all of his career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also director of films in Volver a Beginn, contributed to his usual work: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you must first try before you start to turn and for those who did not casting, he appeared to be a help in what the industry had done, he was 'humble' and he was respected in the film director' in the profession, 'a part of the film.
Many actors, whom he faces in 'Songre de Mayo', have to repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assures that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
"Initially, you believe you are working for the offspring, later you notice that it is only for the work, and now you are satisfied if you have produced a film yet," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back to the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Sevilla worships a dancer, also originating from Sevilla.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for woman's emanzipation, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and sat down for the removal of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who has left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe during the time between wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role that I couldn’t see.”
"We don't try to tell about her life without keeping her spirit," the flame-cottender said.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, 'The Smotterling Dance' came to me like Guajira, or 'The Dragon Dance' like Tango.
Their dance was meaningful and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she claimed.
The inscension expects two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabel once again in one of her ideas, as he did in La puerta open; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who had an exceptional desire to work with one of her ex-schoolgirls.
‘Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature person.
I’m happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very respected.”
The inscension is also expected with musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singing by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and cooperation with the actress Juanfra Júarez, he always assumes the role of the 'company' of the artists.
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, which has been known in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and in addition all over Europe, although she has usually lived in London.
“I wanted to recall them in remembrance, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain era and whose works no longer today and therefore knows less about them,” Bayón said.
The presentation will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book ‘Diario de un poeta recién casado’ also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture Prize, to celebrate the 'Triennium of Genobia' and the 'Juan Ramón' is the aim of the two'.
Thus, 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be concluded with the new edition of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia House Museum and the international exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez' will be presented differently: 'Aquel chopo de luz', now being opened in New York in May.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, which aims to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more famous.
The U.S. can imagine badly without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensions Reporter', and from the then-governmental concept of the American cinema, which was left behind, from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Now look what it cost him to give the Oscar.
When he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, it was a big hit for everyone.
“What someone sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the greatest comforts of his life.”
No one was afraid to make themselves ridiculous or overwhelming.
As the father of the cinema and the country, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and the collapse of the market, where the low self-esteem of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If only a few people can be admired in this hard time without virtue, then you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost incorporated a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered like various losses: from the foundation, which has been prescribed for the fight against drugs and in honor of his son’s first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded until his own home-made and organic products brand.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him much effort to pursue against a deadly nutritional culture.
A wide wave of admiration suggests home to Hollywood without taking into account nationalities and citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The English film director Sam Mendes and Oscar winner said that working with Newman was no longer or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, was awaiting to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the greatest of all of us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who trusted to try to live today as Paul Newman lived: obtaining high demands for justice, leading a responsibly conscious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always simple or not even possible in today’s media.
But there’s someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who was faithful, although there were certainly many ways to not be.
"Why should I eat a hamburger on the street if I have a filet at home?" he often joke himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
"From all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the careful oppas, and the philosopher," they say.
The streets in Madrid are lacking for the Olympics.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure of 2012, maybe it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we ready for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called a perfect street, and according to my assessment, she was the worst street with everything that was there.
Of course, this is a lot of insanity if you would consider the review and I could check it, so something obviously would not have happened.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The madness begins with the tickets, which allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chips to avoid stomach on the streets).
Well, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first stupidity that consists of just for the reason to go there) and (after an infinite snake) there is a surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second stupidity because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis just decided to buy small, much cheaper shirts from less fabrics?
Well, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, there is already a waiting wing of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
It took more than 35 minutes to wait, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the street started and we hadn’t let our backpacks go before it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be harder to get them back.
In addition, it seemed to look after rain in these 40 minutes, so it came to the temptation to organize a people’s rebellion and attack the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will have lung inflammation and some like me will not appear even in time in the classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the output has been wrongly stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never fall into me.
So I think we're going to dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympics for a long time.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the 'Emerging Technology Conference', organized by MIT, Microsoft has introduced the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as a taxi, for example, ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it is a subplaner to run on the campus.
Thanks to a camera and a form and facial detection system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also assign the participants to the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, ‘the receptionist’ notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not part of the group that leads to her conversation, and that no company employee is either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon be listening.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week, we talked very well about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many related programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster.
Everything is only a fix if you consider that Microsoft has added one or more feature and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Sending many suggest that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary to enable hardware and software to work simultaneously.
The operating system fulfills the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to telling his grandmother something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of his ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People always pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and we spend more time surfing every day than in the surroundings of the window.
What is half of the existing applications on the computer?
Less is more
Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so overwhelmed, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need it, without a doubt. I'll give a little example of it.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing beverage machine, a shield is attached: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own online search tool.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft’s employees used Google for network research.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the end of 2009, but at the end of 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility of launching Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 simultaneously.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in ‘Blood Diamond’ by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in ‘The Pate’ by Francis Ford Coppola.
When we start to count the countless stars, we can return to the image of a very powerful man, with a top bar that had raised heavy weights in a walker circle.
Basically, this is a typical male shirt made of cotton, handless and tailled.
The English languages call it 'tank' but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First, because of his great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle. The legend tells that the name development is associated with sport and is derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' overrides all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cutting, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (to be recognized) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neck cutting.
And attention, the Belgian company focuses not only on the production of tanks.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Casmire, Cotton shirts, T-Shirts with strips, Babyies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use them as a underwear.
They are very charming.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is funny, but full of life joy.
Currently, the brothers Gruz takes their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocated her residence and also made the presentation of the main awards in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shameful, winner on the short tracks.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/hiver season that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango, and also visited the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and took part in the dinner at Valentinos honor.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister and I both are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I would like to go through a city and observe women how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do that often.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but finally, everything happens in one, and these areas have many joints.
Since I was a kid, I was excited about clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to walk around in the dress cabinets of my aunt and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a leisure park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we like dancers so much to have our own style in teaching and at the samples to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so much respect for the costume designers and their professionalism.
Recently you've been 30, have you been in crisis?
Oh, was.
I feel better than ever, I feel better than thirty years old.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less errors.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a child, and that has given me much inner joy.
So, you think of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I know that I will become a mother because this requires my body and also wants to be a young mother; I will not let it escape.
As for the candidate, I don't worry.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate them with much love.
With regard to film art, you will keep in mind the works you’ve participated in and played last year.
This is exactly what I want to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and discouraged and I want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I wish La última hora and En busca de la tumba de Cristo were listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's good, say something not.
It’s not like I went to the race to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know two clothes from our Mango collection were stirred to collect money for Naomi NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
Many things will be told about them, as I would tell you those who know them that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to participate in the parade for this great thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stop, I will do that too.
To support women in the third world, whatever is necessary.
The car drivers that can be delayed due to the alcohol level will need to install the ‘alcolock’.
The Authority orders that the driver who had three official penalties due to the alcohol level installs this system in his car, which prohibits him from launching the car in a drunk state.
The initiative was announced in June last month and is now part of the report by the Attorney-General, according to its information, a pilot project, which will last for a year.
The purpose is to resosialize the driver, which is why he receives a course for the transformation of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the State Attorney General, according to experience, the Ministry of Transport and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the car drivers who were shown more than once due to driving under alcoholic influence were taxed again.
The ‘alcolock’ would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents auto-start when the driver has made the alcohol test; or when a concentration of alcohol is determined higher than permitted.
It costs more than EUR 1,000, the costs are charged by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevented up to 65% of the infringements already in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, 115 people could be rescued annually.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual manner, and yet a reform of the fundamental law is required for the legal process.
The device is still available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been incorporated into some utility vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
Tomorrow, the House of Deputies will be voted for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force landed next to the Bento Juárez de México airport’s presidency hall, with the Prince and Prince of Asturias traveling.
The sun went down, but their radiations were still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal couple that came out of the plane.
Directly at Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago, I had asked a taxi driver on the road whether he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturias visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Oh, very good, so you can't take people at the airport about this time you're from here or so.
No, she's the Spanish, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar airport and on the red tape, including military protection of 27 Navy soldiers, giving honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long-winded hair, without the usual 'peep-toes', may have been told her that it is expected to be a wind in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, waiting for the official follow-up.
At the door of the hotel, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter who likes to make a joke.
The Best Premium of Fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there were probably no significantly excellent fashion designers and bonvivans than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a cash price of €300,000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, has seen her drawings in the Mango branch show window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
There are so many events that are associated with that you would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chair at the competition. All of this ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the severe heart that was broken by pain because his brother recently died, collapsed together. He dressed the fashion house and had some jewelry bags of ELAH, which were stunning. He stood on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters large and has Valentino at dinner, to his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, welcomed the guests and was a cavalry so that he ended with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, because jackets have borrowed the lady.
Mónica Cruz, who went to the business and had a shirt and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she weared a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was advised 'a way, she remembered the time
Inés Sastre, he did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning, we were able to rejoice over Oliver Martínez’ presence, a personality that always causes a storm enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) at Hotel Internacional in Paris, in advance asked for a room without smells.
The stars under the star sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's how life is.
1001 Tips Against Stress
There is no 1000, but one more way to forget our chaotic fast everyday life.
And even if there are few, they are all gathered in a book in which it says how to get relaxed. The book comes into the book shops on September 30.
The Awaker is a punishment when he sounds at 7 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of entering the hectic rhythm that the current life requires.
The office is the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one and no two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems as to how to disable the world of work.
However, the number is rising, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of options adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress means “1001 ways to relax” and so comes the rest that the book gives to the books by publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this guide rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or to suggest the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If adrenaline in your vein no longer rises to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, then the time has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speak in sleep
Some children talk at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called talking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you has been told that you have spoken at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, such as during high fever), or regularly (each day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason to cause this phenomenon.
Often, relationships with other phenomena in the sleep are searched for, such as alps, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bed dishes at night), talking in the sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have already mentioned, it can be of very high fiber, stress situations or overload.
Anyway, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, flush or it may be quite the opposite (crowding, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist to verify whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it will not be treated whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, sleep apnoe or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to push the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrifying and somewhat too wild.
In nervous children whose relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some internal relaxation.
This helps the child to sleep calmly.
When speech occurs once in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing about what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will get rid of it from sleep.
Although the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if after a pair of phenomena appears anxious, it is recommended to advise or find out why the child has anxious.
If they understand what it says (what is not so common), the child does not press to perform an understanding and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything, because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can’t think about it.
In addition, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it says and why it says that, therefore be careful with the interpretation of information and the conclusions it draws from.
Maybe, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that takes just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhouses on the game field are finally back on success course.
Without great effort, the Yellow Blacks played numerous turnovers and managed to implement one of them, and thus to win the game.
The pace of this meeting, in which the attackers had an effort to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shots are near the angle, Illhouses should easily dominate the game, and it has succeeded alternately only the funderflick with a remote shot, then the brain with a high pass, and the Romain with a shot with the foothead, to defeat Denemarks.
The enemy team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the living Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two torchances fighting by Riahi and temporary, and immediately after the first door for the Illhouses by Marais, who stood exactly right to take back a ball that was rejected in a first attempt of Diebold.
However, the illusionary Torschot should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, which had to keep his team cameras underlying numbers.
However, Denmark could not take advantage of this and faced no major problems with an illahian elf, which just a little back to their defence, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball was very close to the latte after a large breakthrough.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flys to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another destiny to Britain.
Given the decisive attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet in the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’, and hope that he will come with ‘concrete suggestions’.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee established by the Bretonian fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme rise of the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of EUR 1.14 per liter.
According to the press spokesman of the Elysée Palace David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to ensure the working conditions and the payout of the seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted protest drugs in Morbihan and Calvados, causing a stomach of nearly ten kilometers of length.
The seaport of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
Quiberon peninsula was restricted by a block.
Already on Monday, the seafarers expressed their determination by burning tires and palets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the army channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuvers of trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolve the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The members of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting on Wednesday in the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not be defeated at any point' and 'do not want to go to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents, but they believe the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from 'Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes greeted themselves by the filmmaker and engaged actor Paul Newman who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft with a size range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insured American International Group, financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, takes into account more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was paid to him.
AIG is willing to tax the sale of a large portion of its businesses, beyond their international life insurance and their pensions in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG Sunday evening met to check possible sales.
AIG could not be confirmed.
Assets from which AIG might be separated include its Airline Rental branch International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings back-insured, as well as its real estate and private equity investments, FT further explains.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was made, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make sales to repay the loans she has granted the Federal Reserve, even at the risk that the US authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost in the same manner.
Historical analysis Paris of the session Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks, a historical case of the courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a never-enabled loss of nearly 800 points, and Wednesday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
With regard to the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline after the 11 September terrorist attacks.
According to the final scores, the Nasdag Index, mainly in terms of technology, decreased by 199,61 points to 1,983,73, and the widely used Index Standard&Poors 500 by 8,81% (106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the House of Deputies, which once again should allow some stability on the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been struck at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against, and 205 votes for it, the deputy refused to finance secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected their plan.
"A bad image will be put in circulation here, which represents Congress as unable to adopt a plan," Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial said.
‘This shows how much the market counted on this plan,’ she added, and fears that a project, adopted in several days, will come too late.
“If the project is actually condemned to fail, it will be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, etc.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would limit the loan conditions even more,” said Brian Bethune, Economic Chief of Global Insight.
And Mrs. Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day spreads the ruin of a financial company' in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual competition on Friday, the U.S. authorities plan to purchase the banking stores of Wachovia by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, in Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets face ‘not only an American but a global crisis’, the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic assets has grown strongly.
The revenue of the state cash in the last ten years fell from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827%, and the revenue in the last 30 years from 4.161% on Friday evening to 4.357%.
Obama, winner for points in the first TV double
On Friday's first debate of the two candidates for the White House followed another to find out who was the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this TV duel, which should be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparently, wasn't 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in election surveys five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which published an opinion survey on Saturday, according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
For the uncertain voters, that is, those to whom it is now arriving, Obama came out as a winner of 39% from the surveys, while 25% of them see McCain as a winner, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should confirm his predecessor on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
McCain, seventy-year-old, did not stop putting his uncontroversial experience in the field of foreign policy to the priority, clearly highlighting his opponent's "naïveness" regarding these issues, which constituted the focus of this first television duel.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...," he emphasized several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he added.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican election spot since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself shortly and accurately without allowing himself to be removed.
He turned his ability to make good decisions and renew the image that the world has from the United States.
"McCain still hasn't understood, on the contrary," Obama said on this weekend a democratic election campaign, which made the Republicans assert not to have captured the full extent of the crisis that was burdened on the 'American from the street'.
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama urged 20,000 people who had gathered in a rainfall election event in North Carolina yesterday.
He didn't even mention the words 'median' or 'employers'.' The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage that the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the ground.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton government, compared Obama's 'good economic instincts' with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For democratic candidates, the current crisis is "the final judgment of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
After he reaffirmed that he would even make it possible to reduce the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois stressed that the creation of potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, is best for him.
McCain, however, wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant by 2030.
The two candidates were critical of the issues that came up on the $700 billion (470 billion) financial market plan, which was welcomed by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Have you noticed that a election was held in Minsk?”
Youth and opposition demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections already in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the election rooms on the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result has been announced yet, many youths came to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko’s power: ‘The dictator should resign’.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen, 'What is it useful if they do what they want with my voice?' says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been shown to foreign observers in the best light to restart negotiations with the European Union is willing to carry out a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the non-disambiguation of visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the dismissal of certain assets, could be repealed if these choices were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
"We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the reporting," said Juri Potemkin, a press spokesman of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stressed Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-European movement, because it is important for who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If Members of the Opposition enter parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition is therefore responsible for interfering in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we are at risk to become a protector of Russia.
“We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the election transition, does not recognize the election as valid.
She emphasizes that the numbers of election participation appear to be too high and that the enlargement of voting payments in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has opened the way for any type of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that a election took place?” asked the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the elections.
And there will be up to five members of the opposition in parliament, namely those who are mostly in line with the idea of the government.
The silence of the night goes down again over the October square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission are congratulated on their success.
Interview - From Blood that Re-Safe
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all the reason to be delighted because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has gained the confidence of the public, which was severely shocked by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the donor service of the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
Due to this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada introduced a public investigation led by the judge Horace Cancer in February 1994 aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and developing guidelines to prevent a re-disambiguation of this kind.
While Justice Cancer was still arguing to issue his report, several provinces at that time set a committee on their legs, with the aim of developing a new system for the management of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to Gélineau and cancer reports, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started their work, 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers.
The situation was depressed.
By the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservation and by working in this area over the next few years, we have regained the public’s confidence, she said, before she proudly emphasized that early 2008 almost 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec today.
However, Dr. Décary maintains consciousness that ‘confidence is something extremely fragile’.
Since its founding on September 28, 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted according to the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of cow mind in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said this woman, who has been in charge since the foundation of 1998.
“And we didn’t have the least idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we refer to one of the main guidelines of the cancer reports and Gélineau, according to which excluding measures are applied if you don't know this and if a disease only slowly progresses, as it is obviously the case in the case of Crutzfeldt-Jacob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which is inevitable to.
In April 1999, there was no blood from people who had been staying in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, it was proven without any doubt that this disease will be transmitted over the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we have applied has absolutely a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: Nucleic Acid Tests (NST), which enabled the donor’s blood to demonstrate the occurrence of the virus itself, and not that of the antibodies against the virus as it was in the case of tests used so far.
The NSTs allowed to shorten the time of incubation, which occurs between the time the person was infected and when the first virus can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week.
Thus, the risk of some donors being infected without knowing it was significantly reduced, and you could not recognize this.
These improvements allowed to reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS through a blood transfusion to a significant extent.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you should distribute 12 million blood preservatives before someone infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conserves every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transferred through a blood conserve.
I think you can feel comfortable today when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe to restore your health,” says Hema-Quebec’s director.
‘Our challenge for the next 10 years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogens can enter the system.
Only last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, as well as the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects through blood.
We have to monitor continuously, Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec has to provide adequate supply in addition to a safe supply.
“The need increases because the population ages.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood plates.
The overaging of the population also affects the blood donation network, among which on average only 3% of Quebec’s blood donations are suitable.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the equality criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not assumed because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who travel to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded from blood donations for a year.
With this 3%, we achieve an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew members of this donor chain when they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but especially to keep them and make them become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour in donations of blood,” Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservation, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye caps and skin, which is almost exclusively used for severe fire injuries.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which is also managed by the only public nabel screw blood bank of Quebec.
In the nozzle line, which was previously seen as biomedical waste, there are stem cells rich blood that can serve to treat severe diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousands of navel screw blood samples, and we plan to take more than a thousand per year.
"We probably should start by providing it for transplants at the beginning of next year," Dr. Décary further explains, describing this program as a very popular Navel Screw Blood Reduction program.
Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it, because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-final
Montreal’s Impact, thanks to a 3 to 1 win (4 to 3 with all gates) against the Seattle Sounders at the second game and decide the game of the quarterfinals at the Saputo Stadium, in which the total tower ratio was counted, qualified for the semi-finals of the first USL league’s semi-finals.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the crucial gate in the nineteenth minute.
After a first half-time without a door for both the one side and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan on the way for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the pre- and back-game series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila had introduced a 2 to a 1 niche position in a Seattle neighborhood.
In the semi-final, Impact will be measured with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Thunder was able to balance a 3 to 1 deficit in the back game in Minnesota by a 4 to 3 win, but the white caps went with a total tower ratio of 5 to 4 yet into the semi-final round.
Impact will probably have to face the White Caps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are set today.
In short - Victor by Kovalev
The Canadian team's number 1 trio is ready to attack the season.
Last night, Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec, and Andrej Kostitsyn, led the attack on the Florida Panther with a storm fire, leading to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a door, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I still need a game to feel comfortable.”
"He's been too fixed in the first half," Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a storm aid."
Charest puts on the north
The Prime Minister will not end up launching elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) tried to be elected in the today’s partial election.
'This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.'
During his lecture, a kind of picture mushroom was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of water power plants, mining plants, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', land maps, etc.
Large resources like during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he left his schedule to be very full.
The 'Nord Plan' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' alleged to have for Quebec, namely the one of a 'new economic space', which provides for an agreement with France on labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Although it has been mentioned frequently in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th wide-range - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North is a "jewelry with huge potential", but no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At least some outlook on what could be done more: particularly in water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests’ list, the north has ‘nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds’.
This `area twice as large as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us," he emphasized to clearly show that he's looking for a national founder's dream to be fulfilled.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection to the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecs technique, the James-Bucht.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put a theatre break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador with which Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments persecuted.
"There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to re-examine our vision from the north,” he said and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to ice melting.
In this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, and the inhabitants of the land, and the Invites?
The Prime Minister said Quebec’s government would be very busy dealing with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-peccalist deputies of Ungava) have already launched consultations at about thirty communities.
A minister committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and land values) takes an important place, has included the work.
The Prime Minister does not close a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the North will, in addition, be deprived of the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be ‘discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly’, he promised.
Jean Charest described this ‘Vision’ as if it was a continuation of the Liberal Prime Minister who had been in office before him.
“As the Liberals who were in our office before us, we have been thinking about transforming the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was, for example, one of the repeatedly emphasized themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the overcoming of the party’s leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides for renaming the power plant of Beauharnois into Adélard-Godbout stauda powder.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading about the quiet revolution and the state-run of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James-Bucht, our party always knew to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
The press addressed him to another, this time, conservative project, namely, to the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Eastmain1a-Ruper water power dust, Mr. Charest, whose operation is intended for 2012.
'It remains among us, but I am willing to be there,' he trusted his party members, what exhibited in those accidents.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and, of course, in 2009, has, in fact, the opportunity to hold a election this autumn, which it is possible for him by law, has not yet been excluded.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, especially due to a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided to the Liberal Party Chief a platform of nationalistic plans, particularly from the 'constitutional objectives' which were adopted without furthermore: the PLQ particularly requires the recognition of the 'Quebec' particularity in the Constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council, and that they have a veto on the decisions made in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the directions of the North Plan were included with skepsis.
Pauline Marois, head of the Québécois Party, has reaffirmed the policy for the development of North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government has introduced in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If she had done it, we would have been much further today, Mrs. Marois judged with her candidate in Jean-Talon (which is the election today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has pledged to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
“But what we want is that this will not only be a big idea,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx in a representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - A whole country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-Justice Minister (which irony) at Harper’s cabinet was the one who allowed himself to say last summer about Louise Arbour that she was a ‘shame’ for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending struggle for justice and deserves to cover all our admirations, so with shame, says the same thing about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this here with a government that, as the only one in all the countries concerned, has not brought her Landsman captured in the concentration camp of Guantanamo home.
A government that doesn’t even consider that Omar Khadr was still a youth when things that were happening were thrown down to him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier in unhuman conditions get back to it.
The only one who goes down to a judicial parish to assess the blame of the accused.
Remind us that above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers Association are demanding to bring Omar Khadr home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada.
This government also closes the eyes of torture: it is little interested in that a young adult after so many years of suffering will certainly be mentally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but here we are just experienced a native circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our ‘democracy’, that word, which Harper constantly bears as a flag in front of us, and that sounds so inexcusable from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be arbitrarily misconducted, tortured and detained, according to the minds of a government leader who is supported by only the minority until today (may be entirely part of the minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party, preaching the virtue, law, and order, but they do not see that this government has denied the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this rejection, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwell Speech of Barrick Gold
In its edition of September 17, Le Devoir published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms and follows an Orwell logic that the world’s largest golden production company sought a complaint over six million against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house to open a ‘publicly transparent debate’.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of deception, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely dismissed by Mr. Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate is to put everybody in ruin, who cares to represent one of their opposed opinions.
No matter how the process goes, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defense and fight with very inequalities of weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexpensive pockets of gold mines.
The tactics of these inequalities are often to ruin the defenders in order to force an agreed arrangement that causes the opponent to default and, in addition, disturbs anyone who is afraid to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have to present her view of things in public opinion.
Unlike what is going and going in many countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted by the exchange of ideas rather than by the bulbs.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had disclosed its books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications, and financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light into this issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have confidence in the public and wipes the petitions and letters to support Noir Canada’s authors with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a "public" debate at the same time and yet miss the views of this public?
It appears that this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very dreadful view of the concept.
In a democracy, the opponents themselves have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this mainly because she refuses the brutal attitude of the gold mines.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a knebel complaint (in the course of the 'public debate' Barrick Gold has just made use of a request to the authors of Noir Canada, in which she no longer requires this approach from them.
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and truth findings that are essential for every democratic society.
It completely refuses the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has the right to answer.
The university environment in which we belong has long been able to deal with debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate complaint clearly shows that, unlike what she suggests, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world as well as for the public debate, and it is time for governments to take measures to restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
The administration of Bush and the leaders of Congress, Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been shattering Wall Street for months, has to be adopted by the two Congress Chambers.
The main contents are: Better control of the Members' practical application of the Plan, new mechanisms to ensure the refund of the public funds used, new arrangements to reduce the number of homes found due to payment residues, as well as the right to monitor the wages supported by the leading employees of companies.
U.S. Finance Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the House of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the representative of the Republican, Senator Judd Gregg, in the negotiations, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards a deal that will be market-efficient,” said Bush’s representative, Henry Paulson.
“It happened all to protect the real economy and the American people from the short crisis on Wall Street,” the Democratic Party said.
“This is the basic point: if we do not, the trauma, chaos, and the disturbances in American daily life will be huge,” said Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, because of the fear of the effect that a new failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two U.S. presidential candidates, who only participated in the negotiations later, showed themselves rather than supporters of the agreement, without failing to express their disagreement with the need to meet them in this extreme manner.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements for the agreement, especially those that would allow the owners to maintain their homes, and those that concern the wages of the leading employees of the state-saved companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibleness of certain persons, that is not what you could wish to be happy.
“But these measures are necessary,” he explained to the U.S. television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another broadcaster if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: ‘I would like to know the details first, but I hope.
The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we must all digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
He comes 14 months after a crisis caused by the placement of a real estate blade that initially led to the collapse of risk-rich mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more widespread debt (PCAA), and eventually to freeze financial power and to the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican MPs had failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that some ‘toxic’ assets of societies should only be secured and not purchased by the government, it is believed that the sackgase has escaped.
In order to surround the angle of views for everyone in Congress, it has also been added a provision that says that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it can raise new taxes to retain its capital.
The new plan plan plans to pay the first 250 billion amount, which can be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
A further 350 billion payment must be adopted in a re-vote by the Congress.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares from the supported companies that bring him in the case of gains of dividend, which can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to maintain the settlement procedures relating to the housing related to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the repayment and funding paid to the leading employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is still unsure that their plan will get green light.
Yesterday, further votes against this project were raised, both by the Republicans and Democrats.
‘Obviously, Washington does not understand us,’ said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those in it to ask taxpayers for cash."
Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress, called the "Caucasus of the Sceptics", represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel laureates, wrote us to inform us: we ask Congress not to be put under pressure, and to carefully consider the way to take place," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we again gained proof in Europe that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency assembly, the three Benelux countries announced the partial state settlement of the Fortis Bank Group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Bank BNP Paribas announced that it would resign from purchasing its competitor in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not a lost money,” Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In order to compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savings and households appreciate, now that unsafe times are announced.
During that time, on the other hand, the British government was just planning to regain another bank in trouble from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would purchase the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley, according to Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the British government has to rule since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the Azur blue eyes was his Trumpf for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor get rid of the narzist mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sense of sense, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have also kept him away from a position of power that brings the really terrible monster into the world.
What a great duration runer!
Paul Newman, aged 83, who died on his ranch in Connecticut on Friday, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, for which he looked and for a long time he was a kind of rival on the wall, more careful in his play, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and of the explosion of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the rich faces of the American dream should emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristics.
Because in him, a whole country in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied stage art in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in theatre, television and soon in cinema.
Just like this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became a 24-hour race of Man's Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a preview relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrainable, engaged and oversensitive star, whose mystery will never be completely resolved.
A decent man, in the clearest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the movie lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all his major roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century American film art is constantly changing with him.
Then the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) retreats into memory, and the young man who returns to his sensitive wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat on the hot roof, filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter recurring memory (1990) is called to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfil all of his promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in the course of history.
This criminal, stormful, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean after his death was taken back and made the Newman in 1956 well known.
This sympathetic Ganove in The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and rosary billard player in the wonderful Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
It's still there.
In his curriculum, times unite.
The youth knows him primarily from the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of an Eishockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle ended.
Unlike several filmmakers who have withdrawn from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the seat for a long time, while giving up Hollywood, his wealth, his punk, and his concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the ‘Underplaying’ as he judged his very powerful performance.
The metier was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles were just flying so long.
However, he played rarely sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, fishermen, or despairs, with a perfect representation he reflected his distraction and excitement.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitive sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, drawed a fine-minded women's portrait full of melancholie.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, devoted to this 1984 his film Harry and Son, a work full of feelings and sadness.
At the flood of honors, which were held over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former army companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: ‘His present has improved my life and this country.’
generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the dead actor.
In addition to his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema is now going to Hollywood, an opponent of Hollywood’s drive.
We probably have often seen him with the foot full of vinegarettes, in sauces, cakes or other foods, and this was considered quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
However, the profits from his turnovers went into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed to shooting.
He left his five daughters a letter with these words: "Everything, and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honor to be allowed to pursue the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An excellent citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of addup &amp; Co.?
On October 8th, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János addition and its complications begin.
In particular, the accused is accused of participating in organised crime, as well as serious harm and business fraud, and other criminal acts - including document misconduct.
According to the prosecutor, the funds locked out of the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often dealt with fake invoices.
State funds and subsidies from self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - should be partly entered into the funds of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly entered into the private funds of individuals.
As the investigative authorities reported, fictional bills were submitted in the case of tender funds, and the associations should not meet their duties.
According to the prosecutor, most of the bills have been fake.
The bill blocks were purchased on the market by Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the bills was decided on that round trip north of the Platten Lake, to which István Lados was sent by János.
During this "exploring tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He requested invoices on the consumption to be able to issue invoices later based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These bills were mostly manipulated by István Lados and his complex, András Őri, and the latter, according to our information, were responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploring tour" was a beer local.
As to two invoices issued by addons and Co in 2003, the gastronomy operation is intended to have held the ninety-fige group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But now, the head of the company says, such a large group would not have entered the local at once.
Another bill, issued in summer 2002 to the Job Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and cannot accommodate more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests have been stayed.
The imagination of accounting counterparts seemed not to be the same as the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation, in which the accounting documents of the customers Job Jövőért and Hoppá appear, according to the prosecutor’s authority.
As CEO Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he immediately understood that it was fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the Prosecutor’s Office during an inquiry.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly installed on the stamp."
And further: In addition to form errors, it was also wrong that the operation should have lodged hundreds of people, after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to provide as many people with space.
It has also been mentioned on the invoice, with the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The invoice counterparts have also failed to verify that the Budapest Travel Agency, taken by them, offers travel to abroad exclusively, and so they have indicated Hungarian travel on the cash payment account, which also contradicts the company’s accounting practice.
As it has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also indicated VAT on the bills, although travel agency services that refer to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The amount of VAT was totally wrong on four bills issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Job Jövőért Foundation, as the company was charged by 25 instead of only 15 percent VAT, and the employees were issued exclusively by machine bills, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that took place in the "accounting investors" was that in a case of "the goods transport" they had indicated the performance provided, although this was not offered by the company specialized in investment advisory, the prosecutor reported.
Further form errors - false bill format, false stamp - were due to the facts issued to the Unit a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, as well as to the XXI Century Cultural Association and Biztos Pont as fake bills.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose executives have never issued the bills.
Another "error" is the fake at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was at the time (2001) just in resolution when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület had to eat there - accordingly, the mass manager stated that they did not issue the bills themselves.
consciously falsified
The other group of accountants are people who were quite aware that they had to make fictional bills.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Stiftung Esély Budapestért A Foundation has issued bills for the Stiftung Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, at an amount of about HUF 4 million.
According to the prosecutor, the CEO of Collab Kft. was convicted by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional bills.
The Biogate Kft. is also currently involved in Liquidation: in 2003 the GmbH will have worked with the Job Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Vereine Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület, with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million, which did not carry out its performance.
However, there was just as little payment traffic as the invoices were cancelled immediately after their exhibit, but what the concerned had forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons directly linked to the accused.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postal boat of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trade company based in Budapest, but not found there.
The company is expected to issue several bills on the sale of PC components in the period from October to December 2005, in total of about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigative authority, Cash Investment Kft., located in liquidation from Kiskunhalas, has served as buyer of these bills since 14 September 2005.
The company’s director was a Romanian, to whom the company documents should also be submitted by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, during the investigations, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Vereine Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and has cashed its own value.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos Investment Bt. will be founded by Romanian Maurers on the express desire of Iván Kubatov.
However, in fact, none of these companies were active, which was accused of lack of contracts.
However, he could benefit from the companies: at the request of his compilation, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who had been entrusted with the preparation of the founding documents, has issued bills on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the aid, such as Atlasz and Y-Generación.
In total, Kubatov has issued 15 bills of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov could have cancelled 10% of the invoice sum as well as VAT.
Kubatov has even misused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional bills - in this case, the bills were submitted to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generation and Federation for Modern Hungary submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, the Dancsics Mihály Foundation ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints per year, but these amounts were intended to be used.
In order to do so, they submitted five fictional bills of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
In addition, these bills were secured in the investigation of the office by Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused are now accounted for by a confession on the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been filed before the Prosecutor’s office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János added to a comprehensive consent.
His previous statements were less detailed, and although he had already pledged to report in full about everything several times, his consent remains.
Therefore, the question remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the recovery of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the addition is willing to take responsibility in return.
However, it is quite possible that the addition now plays the "leased" after his search for mildness of the detention and home arrest was hit on dumb ears.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage to economic offenders and have not compensated for them, are on foot, or at least under house arrest, the addition remains denied this possibility.
The psychology of the transfer - or why we are ready to pay more
In case of decoctions, the buyers tend to spend more and therefore overestimate the wrong order.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neuro-economic foundations of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as an increase on eBay, want to not beat and are therefore willing to pay even over-priced.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were studied using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to earn money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain, was measured in losers of the auction in which the opponent's transfer plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-award" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that price rises could be explained by avoiding a overreaction of the Striat.
In order to underestimate their thesis, economists in the research group have employed additional investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the real value of the product, then they made their bets.
Another group also promised a prize of $15 in the event that they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was only that the emphasis on one was on the win, while the other was on the loss.
As evidence for the hypothesis expressed by neuroologists, however, the members of the "confront with losing" group were willing to make higher bets than those in the control or "win" group.
“These results cannot be disclosed from any previous economic theory.
These have just justified the behavior observed at auctions so far with the joy of winning or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the imaginative neurological processes, so we have now prepared a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economics.
Hepatitis: When to visit the doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collection term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowing are common, but the stimulants and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the stimulant, hepatitis viruses spread to two different types: Hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated foods or water), Hepatitis B, C and D viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, separation secret or spice).
Travellers are advised to vaccinate against the viruses A and B, no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear approximately two to three weeks after consuming contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, stomach pain and breakthrough.
Then the yellowness appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine is dark, and the recovery can take up to two to three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from those caused by hepatitis B, much more severe diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only every tenth infected is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people don’t even know about their disease, as the stimulant secretly destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have suffered from blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C diseases worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor with the first signs of unknown origin.
In time, the disease is recoverable, the virus can be eliminated, causing the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
The 30th of September is the World Hepatitis Day, which is held for the first time in 2004 by patients.
The aim of the action is to strengthen the consciousness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their emergence and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results demonstrate that religious faith acts like a kind of "pain remedy" that would already facilitate the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has been investigated how much faith in God affects human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
During the rather strange study, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while studying a painting of God’s Mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it was even possible to prove that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulation.
The research was the first in a research project, in addition to scientists, including philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the testing, the sampling was attached to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: one image of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary among the believers would cause a kind of religious trance while they chose the image of da Vinci because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt calming.
The individuals spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and at this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either watch the religious or other painting.
The Catholics reported that they had felt “safe” when they saw God’s mother, as if they were “carefully” and felt “calm and peace.”
During viewing the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of their eyes.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the trial, thought that you could cause similar effects with other, strongly-effective images, even with the Atheists, you just had to find the right photo.
“We have to find an image that causes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
English bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing faith should change our personality, and in many cases it also does," Wright said.
According to these excellent results, only the question remains what the effect of a Madonna image Leonardos or another similar painting would have on the pain-regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Maria have even better results?
You're what you're telling about yourself
In the event of their tenth birthday, Google can claim with fug and right: it is found in the pockets of people as well as over their heads in the sky: it knows where people have spent their holidays, what specialists they go to, and what they move.
And that is still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google’s CEOs.
In the direction of skeptics, which are blamed by Orwells Horrorvisions, he lets them go: these would just overlooke the essentials of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently stated that Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus to get closer to the company’s original goal, which they wanted to “arrange all the information of this world”.
Schmidt said Google is still changing world work after ten years at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are still unable to know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that during their Internet research, the terms of search would be recorded, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later use it, so that the hits can be generated much more accurate later, and based on the same logic also the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services due to previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data abuse - "When you look at what I am doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that acts exciting fear, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, striving for freedom, or rejecting the power that affects many Internet users to reject.
However, it is proven that the search terms are not only stored, but also transmitted to third parties in the event, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, during which Google the Brazilian government provided information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled identification of pedophilia.
For personal rights, however, users were still able to resign in May when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully appealed to the FBI: Google could not be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future.
(In addition, the Federal Government successfully achieved the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it had re-evaluated the list of individual users, their web and search terms list for two months.)
Google’s Image remains therefore controversial: Those who dismiss their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere through the use of Google services are deprived of the company with which the conservatively representing companies are responsible.
Nevertheless, the American Geek Culture, which is present in many countries and unite enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cooled entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that Google does not require its users identification codes unlike Microsoft, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appear to be much more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geeks look at the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet-measurement - a relationship that has been focused, particularly in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In Web 2.0, it is nothing more than collaborating, talking to users who deliberately leave traces and benefit from the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely publicly.
An average youth can at the same time manage his profile on several community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, they can connect with other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually include all of this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm.
And a number of other examples prove: when looking at the party photos last night, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed with, or the employee will be released because in his blog he just makes his too honest concern about corporate leadership - one is certain: the term "privacy has become centrally" interpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he rewards himself - in such a way, you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to avoid the Google monopoly, can do this - like Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google’s search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Not a few people will not deliberately register on community sites so that they are not found, but also Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can deal with alternative versions that are linked to no giant server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
However, public opinion is waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even in front of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster-introduced services provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers.
However, critical viewers find also the worrying counterparts: For example, the group’s leadership has completely rejected a protest of employees after the duplication of the fees of the company’s own children’s garden, in addition, the management meant that it would be too costly, the repeated treatment of employees would have been a regimetic, but it all encouraged to be quite contrary to the government, even to be contrary to the Ktoach in 2006.
The company's internal regulation is that no new service will be promoted in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could turn a lot stronger again: while some think, because of your problem setting, Google's health profile, or archiving projects are now taking the fullest measure of one, and the company will soon be able to get a lot out of the court.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in the best orwell way a future in which a person is scaryly nearby thanks to Google-related data.
Two youths help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate trace
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, police have now interrogated two youths suspected of helping to eliminate traces, police Commissioner Borsod said Tuesday.
Youths were confident, they are currently charged with the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who are defending themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened with a punishment of up to five years of freedom.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspected that he has deliberately killed several people from paying money.
According to the investigations, the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he threw his creditors on Wednesday to a field in Ózd where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long-hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden on the scene.
Together with experts, the police now investigate the facts and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers sales for Prague Stock Exchange
Around €200 million, or 5 billion Czech krones, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100 percent purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports of the Czech newspaper "E15", the offers of Poland include the highest purchase price ever offered to the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have made offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that from all the stakeholders, Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion kroons.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves have already spoken from the "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster we owe to the President of the United States, for example, La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to make his own party for the bill behind one that should bring some relief into the alarming situation.
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be easier to talk about a "second September 11".
The press in Madrid is also part of the sinbock in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the edge of the collapse.
The U.S. financial system is increasingly threatening to break together, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan wasn’t perfect, but now, after the Congress vote, it threatens that Washington hasn’t prepared any political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer ignore the threat, such as the Geneva "Dages Indicator".
However, some countries could still provide their money-saving institutions with money-saving packages and save the banks with the money of the taxpayers from the bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are spreading, no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU Member States must jump over their shadows and centralise control over the monetary markets.
Only on Monday, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna-based "The Standard" reminds us, and the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers now have to go somewhat deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU hasn't seriously addressed the crisis that is now like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "savers" should not immediately "wed" with several hundred billions of euros, it would be advisable to determine in which case it would be reasonable to take the money of the taxpayers to spend even greater damage.
Intelligent Car Imitates the Flight of Hummel
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At the CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was introduced in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by Hummeln to create new systems that prevent accidents.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built a BR23C-type biomimetic system controlled by automotives, a mini-car equipped with the bees’ properties, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In flight, each bees form their own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bees, which can be seen in any direction and in an angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to monitor the function of the composite eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates its distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board that immediately initiates the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is recorded in second breaks, and the author’s robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If not so, the author's robot couldn't react fast enough to avoid obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the author's robot project said.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the inner and most vulnerable part of the protective sheet - a layer that is currently considered inevitable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees if they deviate from other bees.
And that has to end in a fraction of a second.
However, the deviation, unlike the bees, can not occur up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the reversibility of the tyres.
While the bees here are infinitely open many ways to depart from other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotary movement, the relative acceleration and braking at the author.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer lifetime than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it concerns the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on data processing, and even less on the ability to store them.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond to them accordingly.
It doesn’t have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manipulations, so it’s constantly only a handful of KB Memory.
There is no Gigabyte and Megabyte hard memory.
This is the first step in developing the immediate collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates will be in production in the next 10 years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver around obstacles and leading it to the target.
A Name for the Syndicate Child
Now, the written version of the $700 billion heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages, is aimed at purchasing the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local coastline, Congress deputies after several days of debate had passed a heavy rescue package of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have achieved significant progress," Nancy Pelosi, a democratic president in the U.S. House, said, and said the agreement should only be put on paper.
The compromise on the rescue package was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said the result: the program will show effect and it will be effective, but we have to do even more, according to Pelosi, it was not about the rescue of Wall Street, but about the rise of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 p.m. (median European time Monday 2 p.m.), but has not launched an elevation flight on the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Deputies first voted on the draft legislation to stabilize the economy of 2008, then the Senate was on the row.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy,” said Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House.
However, the program differs from the Bush administration’s original recommendation, which means that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of loans loaded securities.
In a first tranche, maximum half of the 700 billion amount will be spent, 250 billion will be available immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount will be spent on the purchase of loan burdened bad securities, and the next $100 billion will be decided by the president.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission itself, which also belongs to the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by the Congress.
Under the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and securities loaded with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As the officials of the ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the appropriate fees for the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to $700 billion can be provided as an immediate aid to the U.S. financial system, whether it is for the largely invested purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in difficulty and now relying on state aid can expect that their deductions, called salopp "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, will be shortened by the government.
There will be a reduction in wages only in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The shortening essentially means that if the ministry purchases under an auction, then the "Golden Handshake" will be taxed unless the issued bank manager will be deferred to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of faulty loans, the government will be aggressively disabled to ensure that the managers will not be overloaded.
The image also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that more people will participate in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that cuts are regulated by law on manager wages, Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, commented on the measure.
The State gains participation rights to the participating banks, so that the risk of taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and the rescued bank get better.
The bill provides that the President must submit to Congress in the next five years a proposal on how taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who had expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers, Californian Republican Darrell Issa said.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price rise was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the major domestic sales markets of the industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the rise in gas prices introduced on July 1.
Considering the domestic markets of the manufacturing industry in comparison with the year, the prices of raw oil processing have increased the most (32.4%).
In the metal processing sector, a 13.2% increase was observed, while the increase in the production of food, beverages, and tobacco was 11 percent.

There is no visa in the United States since 2009.
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian Visa Agreement to enter into force on 12 January, as the Foreign Minister said before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Its view is that "all depends on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in time overseas."
She also stressed that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists had to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy conducts negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will convey her to the "Mediterranean Star-Warting Cross" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, have pledged their support for the $700 billion heavy rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Congress and government representatives have announced that after many days of marathon meetings on Sunday they have reached an agreement on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became the main issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his progression thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s High, which gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidentship candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican convention, is at the same time collapsed.
At a election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly adopt the law on the $700 billion heavy package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We have to act now, and it is responsible (...) – your jobs, your savings, the whole industry, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened,” he said.
He has not forgotten to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete”.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We will all have difficulty to find out about this (...) but nothing is certainly no alternative.”
The Republican Senator said the plan also requires the establishment of a control committee for the finance minister, as well as the limitation of the completion for top managers - something he had to do.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the spokeswoman of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House is likely to vote on the bill on Monday.
Press view of the German-language space
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more self-confidence within the camp - so comments "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and Co are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror ( mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for CSU’s dramatic defeat in his article “Bayern’s Revolution destroys her fathers”.
According to the renowned polyologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his officials.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
At the same time, the breakthrough is a problem of Christian democracy as well as for Angela Merkel.
The CSU’s disaster was not surprising, but on Sunday something ended, which was already quite precisely ten years ago: the undeniable hegemony of a state party.
Since 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell to 47.7 percent, and so for the first time since the fifty-fifty-percent mark fell below
This occurred three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the most cited Stoiber era.
The CSU’s consistent modernization in the Bundesland has ultimately destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but it increased significantly at the rate, but without any impact, the secularization, the educational order, the flow of East and North Germany to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU exchangers.
Modernization is always accompanied by optional multiplication, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and voluntary.
It is noticeable that in recent weeks, the classical groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship, and voters with Abiture as a college degree.
This is where CSU’s support decreased to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener daily newspaper reports in its article "Who are the heads of the party in coalition issues" on the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the VP.
The SPÖ prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not want to establish themselves with respect to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the heads of the party failed to look at their cards.
SPÖ chief Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very likely - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question whether he could then imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, to whom the current VP chief as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Shissel-Molterer course.
There is no question of repeating this direction.
Molterer has responded carefully to red offers.
Co-operation could not be fertile, he said when Faymann tried to interfere with internal concerns of the OVP.
Whether his party is going to opposition or to the coalition is at the moment fully open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ chief Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to take government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European summit for equality has begun in Paris, which will be addressed by the EU Council Presidency France.
In its speech addressed to the Plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of Fidesz of the European People's Party, notably the educational segregation, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that Roma children face, is also the biggest obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Chances Equality.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civilian organizations in the field of equality of chances.
As the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz reported, Járóka noted that, in addition to discrimination in job search, Roma would primarily be deprived of the labour market due to its low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths have no high school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small portion of them can reach a high school degree."
Yaróka further emphasized that education is a fundamental human right to be a key role in the establishment of other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
In the opinion of the Members, it is important that these relationships become aware of the broadest possible circle - that is, Roma and non-Roma -.
For the sooner a Roma student begins school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market are increased; and by income tax and revenue they contribute to national expenditure.
“As EU citizens, Roma must ensure the right to high quality education – bad and segregated lessons must be suspended,” said Lívia Járóka.
As the Member stated, a common, target-oriented and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation process in the education sector, which is essential for the correct compliance of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break the devil circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully authorized citizen," Járóka said.
Since the conference in Berlin last year, the summit will be held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the European Year of equal opportunities.
CSU: Grace in time
Duos Huber-Beckstein's fate will be decided at the end of October
Despite the election debacle, sometimes no heads have been rolled, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were held.
Partide Chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace will last.
The fate of the Tandem after the disastrous 17 percent vote loss was decided at the extraordinary party party last October.
But a lot of duo has already made it look out that it doesn’t want to stick to their chairs.
They want to deal with the angry group and the partyibasis, which one day after the "Bayer tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority demanded personal consequences.
Five years ago - admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career point - the Christian Social Union still reached 60.7 per cent, but now, one year after the puppet against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 per cent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a "alleager" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
While conservatives remain the determinant force in the southern federal country that is also important for the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of partial internal restructuring, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team that leads with the liberal FDP, as well as the right-range "Free voters" survey talks about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of the fate is the same that with the list of "Free Voters" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-staybers first used the Huber-Beckstein Duo to serve the targeted politician without mercy.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far dragged the flies out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSU called on September 28 "the best day of his political race".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic observations towards CDU - according to his opinion, the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and therefore Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, is not rebuilt with a common force act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who hasn’t made a mistake about her disappointment in the Fiasko, believes that CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the major coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6%, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
At the elections on Sunday, no deputy of the opposition has succeeded in the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
The Legislature of the 10 million resident state has come out for decades without an opposition. However, the opposition party assembled under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukaschenko, who had already voted in the unclean elections, would have voted for some of the parliamentary positions in 2006, "thank you for the fourfold of the constitution"
This is why the ODS even took away from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine becomes increasingly economically dependent on natural gas imports from Russia. For the relief of price increases, even loans were included, and the country has also received the sale of Beltrans gas, the owner of the leading gas pipeline by the country, the EU has fully agreed to the Russians because of opposition systems. In the background of the expectations of the opposition, the EU stood high in the hope of Ukraine to have their relationship.
For a temporary relaxation, the evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the disadvantages - such as the shutdown of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday, which is why oppositionists may not appear in the press, and in particular the fact that the opposition would not be present in counting the votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners were approximately set on foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to reject the recognition of the independence of the devastated Georgian provinces of Southern Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia has been a member of the country, with which the Ukraine has been independent.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkewitch said.
According to the 2006 presidential election opposition candidate, a continuation is desirable, although "the powers have been afraid to leave only one opposition in parliament".
The opposition does not plan protests in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to deal with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us on the way when selling stones, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even the older," Milinkewitsch said, claiming that not even the most supported layer of social security of the pensionists is the only layer of social security.
"Due to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time until the "social security" that causes the silence of a cemetery begins to break," Milinkewitsch said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratically.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in the deeds, not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the mature Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “Now we have breakfast before work”
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entry and exit of officials.
As of today, the measure will enter into force against those slams that only distill and then go to coffee drinks during the working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Dressable doors are a means to increase work efficiency through a higher rate of presence and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the presidency of the Council of Ministers.
Masi meant this: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance from officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
Now there is no breakfast at work; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracles at 7 pm."
During a meeting of the High Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
From Rome, the minister announced that "the absents of officials have decreased to 50% within three months, i.e. 60,000 more people are present at work per year."
It added that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy.
"the salary dynamics - according to the minister - were twice as large as the private area in the last 8-10 years and far above the rate of inflation."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have gathered together to counter the Brunetta Decree as part of the call supported by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service profiles with numbers of less absentities in the work,” the consumers say, “the people of active faulpels are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have gathered together to declare war to the illegal standards of the decree.”
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) will fight for additional financial compensation for labour-related diseases, as well as the planned extension of the mandatory home arrest of the sick employer, during which inspection visits can be made, and further aspects of the Minister's innovations will be contested.
Napolitano: "Prevention of work accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain living in disabled.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto Nacional Contra Gli Infortuni sul Trabajo) confirmed that the deadly work accidents were about 1,200.
These figures demonstrate the severity of a phenomenon, which is almost twice as many deaths as caused by murder.
Today, the Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will take place in all provinces of Italy on the 58th National Day for the victims of labour accidents in order to draw the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data, spread by Anmil, and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial is the issue of prevention at work," the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in his statement to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del trabajo) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its “great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, the protection of injured workers, the support for the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion.”
“A scared “susta” has risen up to this; understandably, in tragedy that, measured by their size, trigger some spins in the media and public participation, but the daily reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that “there is definitely a resource problem: it must be invested crucially in education and information.”
The number of initiatives for a more direct awareness in schools by young people feeding the world of labour is particularly important.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to draw away from its social seriousness, a legislative standard must be implemented and improved.
The President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "as the phenomenon of labour-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which offends all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at ending the problem".
"The data of the work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," Anmil's president Pietro Mercandelli said.
"We don't want this "positive trend" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you are actually taking too little to face the phenomenon of the accidents. You can fight with various actions.
We believe that more controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli; but also more measures to clarify the workers who are already starting at school.”
“A further effort is necessary, he adds, in terms of communication and sensitivity of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility by the employers is asked for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli also addressed "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the victims of labour accidents" and urged the "abolition of the social system we are fighting in recent years".
Therefore, the aim is to give the employer a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident will not be dependent on voluntary or random donations that a lawyer decides from time to time."
Mp3-player in charge: risk of hearing damage
Listening to music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee) in a report today published in Brussels on the current and recently identified health risks of the EU.
According to the report, it is clear that 5-10 percent of those who hear sound music for at least five years a week longer than an hour a day with portable music devices risk the lasting loss of their hearing.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of youths that typically put portable music devices and mobile phones on a high volume will harm their hearings without knowing it inevitablely,” Meglena Kuneva said.
According to the scientific findings – it is said by the Eu – there is a clear risk that is pushing to act too quickly.
What really matters is to sensibilize consumers and make this information common.
We need to review the existing control systems once again in order to be fully effective and to keep a step with the new technology.”
Brussels had been responsible for the independent Scientific Committee in view of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
“Scientists – concludes the EU Communication – confirm that you are too concerned and that the EU Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents better from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices.”
There is already a European standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damages that could be caused by too high noise.
These damages can be very limited to solutions such as reducing the volume and length of the noise.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union pointed out that when users of portable music devices only listen to five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) music so that the legal limits are already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who make music beyond this boundary risk the total loss of hearing within five years.
This affects 5-10% of users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We'll start today, it's going to be over in March, the balance will be drawn in June.
This is the scope set by the chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which the Commission took place in the new seat behind the Caracalla therms this morning.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analysis and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," said Alemanno. "The Commission will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the City Council and the Municipal Council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place to develop a large project for Rome.
Its task will be completed in March and the Commission will re-enter, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June, as the Mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission.”
Those who question the Commission's competence as they insist on their commitment, responded to Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will provide and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission provides quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics is dealing with the daily problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to have a longer period of time in mind to work so seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective.”
The Mayor of Rome highlights the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wrack: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us into consideration. It will occupy the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to maintain quality - which it really needs - and thus to make a common step towards the future.”
A future, according to the Mayor of Rome, which “will limit itself not only to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further,” not only as regards the role of Rome as the metropolitan and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to be regarded as independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who through his decisions deceived the U.S. economy and cared for relationships with the enemy Islam (and this is what he does today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are becoming increasingly harsh, right now, where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very dirty: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total."
In fact, these attacks don’t have much to say; it’s racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are also surveys; everyone says Obama will win with a great predecessor.
In this case, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election cabin we will know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hiding until the last time.
“Tell what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to do for, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – just now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his office? 89% responded to the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a trit in the back.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush’s weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves his traces for journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many accuse the Internet, the "marter" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not declare the information about officials to whom they were really concerned about the general credibility.
You don't feel as lonely as before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arising from the cuts of the newsroom, namely the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – the interviewed journalists say – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from being significantly crushed.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press press believe that journalism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in what direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "Killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, hoping "they will bring something good for journalism".
The biggest rise in American journalism is today between the head editors of the newsroom and the journalists who work for them.
56% of the chief editors at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while they are only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security at work".
The operators who are afraid of losing their work within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", namely Red.) is always an up-to-date theme in the United States.
Only 13 percent of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation such as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasters and internet operators, employers offer as they are popular and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The chief editors often get very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get €10,000 a month, including pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, it is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often become sick over the course of the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: GERICHT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate broker, which therefore had requested Grottaferrata to be moved to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the anti-contract investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bn.
During the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, were asked to allow the real estate broker to move from the province to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such arguments (which the prosecutor had proclaimed) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to access evidence against him.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already been revealed a few days ago when the House of Deputies voted against the $700 billion package of the White House: a large portion of Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms yesterday’s edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the Republican party is evolving, increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast seas, which always favours the government institutions and business community and those neoconservatives, which “the ones in Washington” and the financial world chooses in the south and faces the enemy.
This part of the party is due to its rise v.a. the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example is only a small part of the major changes that announce or even already represent the current economic earthquake: not only in the United States, in the entire west, and perhaps beyond, will be affected by them.
Both in the countries and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-term feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unaudited state renaissance in connection with a kind of renaissance of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions that have close connections to abroad and at the same time manage an unprecedented amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: how to behave with the affected families, which are also a huge voter mass.
The crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost national.
Political internationalism seems to have lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects with the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, etc. Distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became increasingly serious, only the United States has been rescued in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use these: thus two non-overvaluing conditions – under certain circumstances – in which otherwise no international organization or market will be able to apply in a similar manner.
The new emphasis on the state-national element is, in addition, perfectly in line with the increasing importance that has been linked recently to a closest related sector in the economy: territoriality.
The paradoxal way is now that we have been so convinced that we have long entered a networked general empire into a empire of constantly differentiated technologies, of immaterials, that we must at once determine how our future will depend on the essential matters: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, they are still connected to an extreme part of Earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one possessing such a territory is in the benefit of another who lives in a harvest-free, water-free or oil-free area.
Now I come to the second newness, which requires a short inspiration.
Who is the territory, who is the government, who is the politician, calls leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disturbance over the existing guidelines, including those of the economy, which have been dismissed as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, a deeper and in some sense even more worrying aspect comes: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of unnecessaryness, a feeling of distantness, which all focuses on a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
In this way, the conviction among many parts of the population seems to be the way that not only the acts of social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose wages represent the majority as increasingly alien and overcome.
Thus, the demand for leadership feeds undergroundly a distorted but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and the traditional political establishments. This manifests itself in unpredictable "revolts" of voters and in the unmeditated revolt of Italy to the ruling of the ruling of the ruling of the last time, you may have a consequence of the U.S.
It is the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems, and therefore less representative value in relation to what is now moving in the lower social layers of the West.
In the face of all of this, it would be simply overwhelming to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping your eyes open is certainly not.
The super clamp that leaves the walls up
The strengths of gravity to beat thanks to a leather and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which is now apparently focused on the target.
With a sticker placed on a surface of only 2.5 sq.m., the researchers managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a stretched wall.
The STUDIO – has an American journal, has published the results of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives that use a special carbon structure called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the sticker can be imagined as a series of pipes arranged by a stack of spaghetti," Zhong Lin Wang, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, explains.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, covered by microscopic harvests that give the animal a perfect stand.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and sliding paper have shown that the new sticker is ten times stronger than the durability of the reptiles’ feet and at the same time “heatlessly remove from the wall,” said Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering Sciences.
"This material could be used as a perishable adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps it is, but researchers think more about a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, as nano tubes are also the conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within the space space area.
For the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
The other Art of Research – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article from the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfiber adhesive that cleans themselves like hair by moving on a surface from the dust itself and thus always keeps a perfect responsibility.
Drugs: Never take fruit juice
Caution against grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, etc. in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken with certain vital drugs, as they can extremely affect their intake by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. As part of the 236. meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reiterated the alert: There is enough glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juices to eliminate the health of patients, making the absorption of certain medicines so vital.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents to toxic levels.
The same medicine agency had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mixture two years ago in a report, emphasizing what is being used in connection with means such as diazepan or metadon.
It is NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that the drugs can inhibit.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
According to Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano, “These results are usually immediately transmitted to the various international producers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still unclearities, to ask a pharmacist or physician,” the Ansa Agency’s expert emphasizes.
The Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a headline article from the New York Times that this second event was more crucial for the history of the United States than the attack.
A prediction that received little polemics as a response and was preserved to the economist years later, but today is proven to be completely correct.
“I’m surprised and also shocked how quickly the remembrance of the scandals has disappeared as part of Enron’s or Worldcom’s collapse from the public view field,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "big value economist", but also a "very aggressive style analyst, particularly targeting the excessive liberalism of the Bush government."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release has come; the Open Source Software wins an increasing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft Office, both at home and in the office, both in the open-source and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by voluntary developers, supervised by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents the audience with some news: in addition to a revised and now Spartan-designed start menu, now a document is finally given on the basis of 1.2-based compatibility with Apple’s operating system, so the new format, Mac OS x, as well as the new ISO support.
Beware of the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, which can be read by OpenOffice new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting are some new features, such as those that allow you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, e.g., making it easier to send via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules while retaining the original image of the page.
So now you can also generate "hybrid" PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed with multiple hands by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is awarded a fraction to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are just about to publish different features of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. So it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, if cost-freeness can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program into private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed: in the end, various public administration and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, it does not even lack a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding texting program; Calc, the table program, which aims to discharge Excel; Impress, to create presentations such as Powerpoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the known Access; and lastly a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also positively tested and thus the fourth doping case
It opens up a new doping case to me in the framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-classist and winner of the best climbing trikot.
The message published the newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who has been tested positively on Cera, the third-generation Epo, which has already happened to the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as German Stefan Schumacher.
The tests from the blood samples of Kohls include those carried out in the last weeks by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay Malabry.
Now that the counter samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission, Pierre Bordry, confirmed the positive epotest, and the Austrian officials, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans and also claimed the best climbing trikot for himself.
THEMA INTRODUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGT: IS ITALIAN RASSIST?
Italy, "the only country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken with opposition.
The New York Times asks in a long article dedicated to the theme of racism in Italy and comes from the case of the youth from Burkina Faso, Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he crashed a package of cakes.
The case is witnessed by what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and employment opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest level of anti-immigration sentiments and the largest support of the Lega Nord".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation imposed by the Lega against immigration and for the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also indicated as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that also highlights the Pope and the President of the State: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope to meet at the Quirinal for a cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism.”
Students victims of up to €900 per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students is not aware of crises.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the tenant trade unions, a single room can cost up to €900 in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“This phenomenon has already taken very serious trains. So many students lose their right to study as their families are unable to support them at this level,” says Sunia’s official Laura Mariani, “in these cities, the great demand of students has led to a deformation of the market, which has also caused the other people.
In addition, most rental offers include a series of infringements: free contracts, lack of registrations, without rental price limits, unauthorized rentals.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures that lead to lower lease prices by revising taxation.
In a more detailed review of the investigation, it shows that a bedroom in Milan is needed in the vicinity of Brianza of about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the vicinity of Bande Nere) and ends at 800 euros in the vicinity of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, an average sleeping area costs EUR 350/400, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods of the university, are €250/280 for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods of the university are about €600 for a single room, 450 for a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rentals in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outside districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping space and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighbourhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, a single room of at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of rental to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rental that is 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Bye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historical cinemas are closed due to the beneficial multiplex cinemas.
A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes.
This image of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes what is currently happening in the large urban centres of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complexes in the periphery, means, in the long term, the death of the single-sale cinema in the center. A process that appears not only irrevocable and irrevocable, but also bears the trains of a cultural crime.
Most of these are historical places full of memories, "it's like losing a friend with whom you've put a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who introduced him 20 years ago the Oscar and the great prize of Cannes. It's always the story of a pre-city cinema and nostalgia, which consists of a well-living film.
The numbers provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the unforeseen amount of 316 traditional cinemas had to be closed; these zeches mostly paid the cinemas in major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardia with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because there are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been recorded: with 195 in the last five years, Lombardia leads the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational manner," said Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "although it is useful to create new structures, but first of all the retention of the existing, because it closes a hall in the city, not all of its tribal customers are ready to visit an old multiplex cinema in the periphery.
And here, the lack of state for the Trade Association Fund remains out of sight: the debt burden recorded by the State is about €10 million.
It is a shame from the ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, there would be between 16 and 18 million euros per year of need.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The foreseen measures include tax benefits for cinema operators as well as public transport benefits: it will be possible to drive into the limited areas of the centre and park at cheaper parking fees.
“It’s a joyful initiative,” said Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will join our example and, in addition, develop new concepts.
But we certainly also need better audio and video equipment to be able to directed against the superpower of the multiplex halls somewhat, because the audience of today is more challenging.
The defence of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closing of Baghiera's "supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that made me start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even though I had played with the thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass through the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so I don’t have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and Ndrangheta lead to arrest of Mayor Gioia Tauro
“Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia Group.
The charges of the lawyers of the anti-mafia officials of Kalabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for involvement in mafia businesses, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer whose name is the same as the boss of the clan, was already sentenced to compensation for the criminal associations of the Mafia at the time.
“All kinds of moral and legal norm misconsidered,” the lawyers wrote, “the two local administrations had decided to pay Piromalli’s lawyer funds for consulting activities.”
“So the mafia group was made possible on the official way to enter the council houses and co-determine the policy of public administration.”
The President of the Regional Committee of Kalabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in its region "all other than an exception is to face connections of local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in other places where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the Ndrangheta: heroes who get a white west.”
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which the police of the Piromalli Clan were arrested.
Since the end of April, the Municipal Council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and then also due to alleged ties between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians of their municipal offices have been addressed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the Middle Right Coalition in May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in Deputy Minister Marco Minniti, whom he loved to have invented for political and strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with the arrest order this morning that the Piromalli clan had even expected to apply for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an interview with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the desires of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making public administration measures identical to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes out of the waves, the great ones suddenly run on
It is a non-defective source of money that covers over 70% of the surface of the planet, and only now it seems to be understood by the world’s big energy companies.
Waves, streams and times are the new renewable energy sources that all look at now, and are also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the sea movements has been considered and investigated for 70 years; these studies have not randomly intensified since the first earthquake.
When the price of oil in 1980 broke, the idea of sea energy was lost, but now environmental organizations and the increase in oil prices are pressing on new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This is the duplication of the current energy produced by nuclear power plants.
There are also currents and timelines.
Giants at the attack.
The first company now putting on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now putting on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesman of one of the U.S. giant companies in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the opportunity to work with us.”
This is about the acquisition of an authorisation by the U.S. Energy Commission necessary to launch a project on the coast of Alaska.
This is an unprecedented sign, for example, when considering that oil is still being promoted in Alaska by the United States and that President Bush has recently put in place the plans for new drillings.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are also unknown, observers say of increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the outbreak, which is not the last, since the last doubts have not been clarified by environmentalists.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of rather small dimensions and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy at a large scale, technology with a much greater impact on the environment requires.
There are several options: Ocean Power is using a system of interconnected bows.
The movement of the waves, which move the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer through coils and cylinders.
This drives a turbine which, in turn, operates a generator.
The electricity will be sent to the coast through subwater lines.
Until now, there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval, and part of the energy obtained could also serve military bodies.
Verdant Power is already producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the period drive the turbines that feed the generator through the rotary movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake from potential customers is already waiting for the necessary authorisations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the times.
According to the Institute for Electricity Research, a particular interest is earned instantly the potential that is in time.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
Current energy is what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – for 2009, it is planned to reach up to 35 million.
