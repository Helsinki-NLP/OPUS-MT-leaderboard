"Welsh Assembli's members are concerned about being 'like a mantle'"
A few members of the MWP are concerned about the change of their membership in the MWP (Member of the Valley Parliament).
As a result of this fear, we propose to change the name of the Assembly.
Assembli members of the various political groups are afraid to focus on the change of the name.
Assembli, a member of the Lebanese team, said his team was worried that "confronted with the new Twp and Pwp."
For outside readers of Wales: in Wales language, Twp's meanings are stupid and Pwp's meanings are stupid.
A played assembli member said that as a team, they have advised the alternatives "not Indians" and as a team.
A member of the Welsh Concervev Party said that the group's name change was seen as "open" but noted that the difference between MWP and the measure is slight.
In this sense, the expression of the Waesh Bern W.B. is like the expression of Yorkshire English U Bern.
The Assembli Committee, which is currently adopting legislation for the beginning of the name change process, said: "The members of Assembli will definitely take the final decision on what will be the description of the members of the Assembli members."
The Department of Wales Act of 2017 grants the right to change their names.
In June, the Commission will publish the results of a population where the proposals for waves parliament to change the name of the assembly will be supported by a large number of people.
As regards members of the Assembly, the committee is supporting the Wallish parliamentary memory or WMP, but MWP has received the most popular support.
Assuming, members of the Assembly are advised to have different options, but it will be difficult to reach the task for the Prize Officer, Elin Jones, whose bill expenses are to be paid within a few weeks.
This amendment will include various changes in the action of the Assembly, which include the ineligibleness of the members of the Assembly and the design of the system of the Committee.
Following the debate on this bill, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to finalize the vote on what their candidates should be.
Macedonians vote in the country's vote on the change of the country's name
"Whether the Republic of North Macedonia is going to be changed, the voters will vote on Sunday.
The neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia, is organized in order to avoid a decade-long opposition.
Athens has long pledged that its neighbourhood name is the point of establishing claims on their region, and for this reason the country has repeatedly opposed each application of members of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the vote on name change, said he would oppose the vote.
Although the supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Joey, believe that the change of name is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's Hours of the Church of Harlem is silent
"I have spoken to those people who have spoken to me, they say that in every corner there was a church and a panshah," said Mr. Adams.
"There's no one today."
He said that it's obvious that it's going to be a problem.
Currently, there are "social communications" in different ways.
"Panshalls are no longer a house of residence where everyone is based on a regular basis."
In the case of the Church, he is concerned that the money sold by the assets will not last as long as the leaders think, "And no matter today and tomorrow, they will return where they started."
He also said that the church could build apartment buildings and condoms where all people will live who will not help the rest of the temples of the region.
"The majority of those who buy Condominium will be in these buildings," he said, "and so they will speed up the day that these churches are terminated because people who come to this Condominium are likely to become members of the Church."
The Harlem was founded by the Church of Shebatang – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and a decade later in St. Martin.
The Mull Shbetang Methadist Church left the church in 1930.
In the nearby worship, a clergy is the owner of the building.
Under Reverend John Howard Johnson, a cravings church of St. Martins takes over, who refuses to give jobs to cravings workers and is a debtor for a debtor of the debtor and debtor – a dealer against salesmen on the streets of the cravings.
In 1939, the building was damaged in a fire accident, but the residents of Paris in Fadar Johnson planned to rebuild it, then they arranged the Carillon to build it.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Fadar Johnson, and the protesters in St. Martins are proud to play "the clock of the poor people."
In July, Caroline, who was a member of the expert, called it a few different names: "A Historical Resources" and "A Complete Historical News."
The University of Michigan, Tiffany Nong, also said it was the world's Arithm Carrilon, a wildlife environment. That was the Bazan DIO A. Lind, who was the largest Carrilon of the Reversed Church occupied 18 years ago.
Mr. Mariander said that St. Martin hasn't replaced him.
What happened in St. Martins in recent months is a complicated event of the founders and advisors, which are hired by general leaders of the Church or the Episople Diocesers.
Vestri – the Paris Governing Body, which is composed of general leaders – reports on their concerns in July last year that they believe that Diocese will "move the cost" of the Vestri, although they were not sent by Diocese.
Some members of Paris accused of lack of transparency in the work of Diocese.
In California, a 13-year-old Gulda is injured by Hungarian attacks after the arrest of chickens.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured in the attack of Hanger after the first day of the Gulda Chiang Rai season to capture Gulda Chiang Rai, officials said.
The incident of the attack occurred next to the NCIS in the morning.
Chad Hamel San Diego told KSWB TV that he helped him to get him out of water with his friends on Saturday morning when he was shouting for the boy's help for about half an hour.
Hemal said, "He first thought the boy was snorking for the joy of catching a buld shingle, but then he "can understand that the boy said, 'I'm ruined!'"
“I’ve been kidnapping!”
"The voice of her hair was broken," Hamal said, and he saw the boy coming to him.
"I'm calling for all to come out of the water to say, 'There's a hammer in the water!'" he added.
The boy was sent to San Diego's Daddy Childrens Hospital where he was in a serious situation.
The species of the attacker was not known.
Lifgard Captain Larry Gyels said in a press release, a crash appears to be present in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a dangerous species.
Jails also said that the person who was injured has been seriously injured in the upper part of his wound.
Employees have banned entry to the coast of NCIS for 48 hours, starting from the Pento Beach of Cassabad.
Jails said that more than 133 species of hanger are seen in the area, most of which are not dangerous.

In addition, the Perfume Seller of the Fragrance Shops will launch a test of the distribution of the products through the two Sanbers stores, which was first launched in South London's credit in the past week, and the second will be launched in the Barmingham Oak in the next part of this year.
Buying small amounts of food in the online shopping and local muddy stores means trying to increase the supermarkets for the customer's integration.
Mike Cup, Chief Executive Officer of Sanbery, said outlets should look like a department store because the supermarket chain is competing with a shop like Aldi and Lidal, and there will be more services and other products.
Since the purchase of the two Argos and Habitats Chain two years ago, Sanberis has been selling hundreds of Argos outlets in stores and opening several habitates, which has now increased sales of the products and have gained more profits.

There is a furniture in the marketplace that is manufactured for sale."
Experts believe the representative of Dais Merning, who is currently one of the most reliable stars in the UK, can be a million pounds damage to the farm due to its presentation because they are already going to start from the cushion, starting from the growth and getting rise from this, clothing, and household items like clothing.
And that can lead to a long-term abstinence of friendship.
The mother of three children, Viloby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been closer to John and his wife, Tara, for a decade.
Wiloby began trolling with Cap in 2016 and joined John as chairman in March 25, 2016.
Jogladba has 40 percent of Jones' shares on the Baldwin TV farm, together with the holidays of Katna and Boldwin.

Why did President Trump leave so much?
Trump said in a voice, his Macy's "News Representative."
"I didn't leave."
He said he was interested in meeting Kim for the second time after their first meeting in Singapour in June. Trump claimed their first meeting as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, the nuclear weapons system has been contacted.
After more than three months of the Singapore Conference, North Korea's Top Cultural Rei Yong Ho on Saturday told the world leader at the UN General Meeting that North Korea's previous anti-armed action is not being seen in the United States' "compromising action."
However, he said the U.S. has left the ban for the purpose of applying pressure.
Trump expressed more positive views during his speeches.
"We're in good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were facing the war with North Korea.
Ten people could have been killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He claims that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have produced positive results – which has resulted in the completion of the rocket test, the release of prisoners and the re-release of the remaining American employees to the country.
And he supported the unusual phenomenon to talk about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to behave President-in-law, but it's just 200 people who are standing here instead of trying to get out of this one of the 100,000 people in Janakir Erin," Trump said.

The natural disadvantages make the communication system more pronounced.
A vessel is going to Palu to the hospital, but it takes at least three days to reach the new situation.
President Joko Vidodo has put the development of the Indonesian Jarzier infrastructure in the centre of his election campaign and has invested a huge amount of money in building roads and railroads.
However, the lack of investment before the re-election of the next year has attracted the government of Zhaab Joko.
Zoco also feels pressure from the long-term social excitement of Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have taken more sustainable lifestyles in their religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed among Christians and Muslims, and more than tens of thousands have been homeless. These are the two sides of the streets with the arms of the arms, the arms of the thighs, and the other arms of the Russians.

A great performance and results for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, they kept all the expectations to go beyond their superior speed.
Their kinds of games and players have changed very little since they came back to the top, but they have to go to the Gratitude Holt since they came to him for the way he gathered the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
The captain was great, created a greatly organized defense, and always put the golden and Joe Warell on the ground.
Although Ranger's inspiration was low.
As good as they were under Jerry, their values fell down.
Their finals were missing - only once they opened the fans - and it's a warning for Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.

The U.S. should be doubled in artificial intelligence.
As China has become more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. and should double the amount of expenditure in research in this field has been made for researchers and investors of Artificial Intelligence, who has worked for Google and Microsoft.
The statement came from various parts of the government, the U.S. declared that there is an official strategic threat to the U.S. artificial intelligence.
China has already launched its new plan last year: its goal is to achieve 1st place in the Artificial Intelligence initiative in 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence research will be a good start in a good new way, where most countries are behind a lot in this field and we are looking for further steps to advance in artificial intelligence."
The chances of the next major artificial intelligence in the United States can double, Lea said in an interview this week.
Li, whose book "Al Superwaters: 'China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order' is Hutton Millennium Harcourt, the chief elector of the Synography Venture, which is one of China's+ top-range artistic institutions.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Meln University worked on a artificial intelligence system that was defeated by the highest-ranking American players and defeated him. He was the leader of Microsoft Research and the leader of China.
Li has recognized the previous U.S. government's competition for advanced research projects such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Defence.
The government has often to work hard for researchers in the United States to win grants, Li said.
"China doesn't take away academic leaders; the corporations give them," Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired students from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in the immigration policy could help to increase the U.S. IA's efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered to PHD automatically to artificial intelligence," he said. The efforts of SAI increased.
In July 2017, the State Council of China launched its next generation artificial intelligence development plans.

Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name
Whether the Republic of North Macedonia voted in a vote on it on Sunday changing the name of the population of Macedonia, it was a step that solved the old conflict with Greece for several decades.
Greece, where it has a province called Macedonia, represents a claim of its land and has denied the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments have signed an agreement on the basis of a new name in June, but the nationalist opponents believe that this change will reduce the national familiarity of the majority of the population of Slovenia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and he's worried whether the tournament out at least 50 percent needed to be legal in the campaign.
The question was: "You have a treaty with Greece, including the recognition of NATO and members of the European Union."
Prime Minister Jordan Jayv, supporters of the name change have revealed a reason for granting the price to the European Union and NATO organization for one of the most developed countries from the start of Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote today for the future of the country, to make youths in Macedonia so that they can survive in the EU's destruction because it means safe life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska Skopez.
Although it is not legally mandatory, sufficient parliamentary Members say they will comply with the results of the vote through decision-making.
In order to change the name, two-thirds of the parliament requires a majority.
The government's election committee said there was no news of an irregular period in the afternoon.
However, only 16 percent voted against 44% of the national parliamentary election in 2016, while 66% of the registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," a voter from the capital Scoop said in a statement.
Macedonian Prime Minister Joran Jaev, his wife Jorika and his son Dusco Macedonia voted on the change of the country's name, which will take part in the NATO and the European Union's 20th century.
The 45-year-old Vladimir Kavadharkv had prepared a small square in front of the parliament in Scope, and the chair was placed in front of the building of the tent for those who would be elected.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to add our heads, not with the door of the service," Kavadarov said.
"We're a poor country, but we're a poor country.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and become part of the continent of Europe-Asia."
Prime Minister Jaev said NATO membership will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe it's going to be a huge majority because more than 80% of our citizens are in the European Union and NATO," he said.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
The Macedonian Institute for Political Research, published last Monday, said it will take part in a vote of 30 to 43% of the votes required for the tournament out.
Another report conducted by Macedonian oil television has been seen, 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote.
More than 50% of the votes are required to be successful.
The failed vote will be the first injury in the policy of the Western government since the last month's adoption of power.

Trump's meeting in Western Virginia
While talking about the importance of the Republican voting during the midterm elections, the president, Brett Kavana, who was elected to the Supreme Court, strongly pointed out the surrounding situation.
"What we have done is at risk in November.
One of the most important elections in our lifetime is within five weeks.
"It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running because I've been around all the places to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You're seeing this terrifying, terrifying medical group of Democrates, you're seeing it happening now.
And they strongly believe in recovering energy by using any means, you see this principle, competence.
"They're injuring those who are injuring, they're going to follow them to get power and control, they don't give them anything, they just want power and control, we don't give them it."
He said the Democrats are in the "refusing and obstacle" mission.
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, exciting the Democrates as "Ground and down and witch and incredible."
He called Diane Finestine by the Senate Court of Justice of the Department of Democratic Senate, which was received by the visitors by the highest level.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you find a devil?
Oh, oh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for - it was really bad body languize - the worst body languize I've seen."
Lebanon is no longer a free organization.
They don't have to be patient with what they think.
When the members of the Monumental Party in my area blamed me, it wasn't surprising.
Because, I don't welcome your mind to talk about here - I was the last MP on the list to tell you this.
My parliamentary co-worker Johann Ryan was treated the same because he was firmly opposed to Jews.
In my case, I was accused of being doubled with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
On Friday, it was noted that "we want to bring meetings inclusive and productive."
As a local leather MP in my eight years, the GCC meeting was similar to this Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, it's not that summit, and the promise of the "divine, dead" policy has been forgotten to go long, if it really ever begins.
It has been increasingly prescribed that the party is not tolerated in different ways and that it is acceptable for the party's leadership to be judged in each opinion.
It began after Jeremy became the leader, I thought with colleagues that I was aware of the same kind of political perspective they began to expect to take the U-Turn for me and to take a position that I wouldn't be a politician or in any situation. It was a national security.
When I speak publicly – and although nothing happens about it – there is a call for a retreat in the social media, a call for a retreat, a call for a central policy, and it is said to me that I should not be at the party of my lips.
It's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because my comments are also political.
I am surprised that all of the co-workers face the storm of gender-based distortion or barbaric destruction every day, nevertheless they won't be ashamed of their professionalism and project.
The most disappointing point in politics in this time is how Galagali's independence has become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labar Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization, and the change in the rules of each "noun" vote or elections defines the party.
For the past two years, many have advised me to keep my head down, I haven't been so busy, and so I'm going to be "going up."
I haven't come to politics to do this.
When I joined me as a school school in Lebanon 32 years ago, the Teacher was given to us by the government's ahela, which was devastating our extensive school classrooms as a destruction, and I was trying to provide all the necessary public services.
I've never hid my politics with the last elections.
Nobody in the East of Natingham has been confused about my position and fields of opposition with the current leadership.
For those who announced this movement on Friday, I will only tell them that when the country goes forward to a Brexit that will harm the family, business organizations and our communities, I will not be afraid to see the leader of the Lebar Party. I want to show up time and get my power
But I really don't have any message for the Nottingham Momentam, it's to my election centres, or members of Lebanon: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that you will not find any threats or political justice to me in any way.

Ayour 38-17: Ayour was raised at the top of the unexpected Ayour
The late two attempts could reduce the need for the final results, but there is no doubt that the day's amazing amusing Tent Premiership match was eligible to win.
They're the only team at the top of the table, in the 10th.
Finally, it was their best defence, just as good their ability to take the opportunity, which helped the natural team win and was the right reason to be happy with Koch Peter Murch.
"We've been tested every game so far, and we're still lost, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie said: "They have to give Ayro credits, they have worked better than we do."

Climho grew up in the panel with Ayer's lead, just before it was, during the hafttime, he grew alone and became a break of 17-5.

The game was closed for a long time for a serious injury in the nightmare, which had become streaked and the game was restarted, and the game was a lot more advanced through Stephen McDonald's attempt, which was transformed.
The overwhelming officer Blair MacFarson then got the yellow card and again gave the additional player of the year's Bros Colvin attempt at the end of a spell of martial pressure.

"We are the sea": the court hopes to open its way to the Pacific Ocean again
Nabikers have deployed a recruiting class at La Paige.
Public buildings are flying a blue-sea flag.

It is a duty to recover."
In the eighteenth-century conflict of bloody resources in Bolivia, the memory of the coast of Chile is still clear – just as it is the turn of traveling again to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the highest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the night of the International Court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"We have the speed, consciousness and construction, and of course we expect results with a positive perspective," Bolivia's political Roberto Calzadila said.
Many Bolivian ICJs will see large rounds across the country, they hope that Heager’s Trinity will be able to face this claim - after a few decades of appropriate negotiations - for the Chilean Bolivian Sea.
Ivo Morales, Bolivia's Indian President Carismmatic - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - also depends on the night of Saturday.
"We are very close to returning to the peaceful ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court has no chance to make a decision on Bolivia - and if so, it will change a little.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the power to provide earthquake to Chile and has not stated that they will not determine the results of the possible negotiations.
The ICJ's report indicates that the final hearing of justification came only six months later that the case was "not complicated," the Chilean International Law expert said in a statement.
And it may have been back again in the past four years than Bolivia's cause.
"The issue of sea entry is currently being deployed by the administration of Bolivia," Jeretta said.
The Maral's anti-war speech has given a congratulation to Chili, he said.
Bolivia and Chile can be talked up to a stage, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries haven't exchanged the government since 1962.
Representative of the Hague Bolivia, former President Adward Rdrigges, has rejected the issue that the decision of the Court of Justice would be incredibly rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "a great opportunity for the new age about Chili" and "to take away 139 years of opposition with mutual advantages," he said.
Calçadilla also rejected that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - uses the Maritime issue as a political discovery.
"Libya will never leave the right to enter the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to cut the past."
North Korea said that nuclear weapons would not be allowed to trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Yong said that if he couldn't believe Washington, his nation wouldn't first defeat nuclear weapons.
He said this on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the U.S. opponent leaders to comply with the promise he made at a summit in Singapore.
His comments are coming when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompey also appears to be on the way to restart original nuclear policy with North Korean Kim Jong-un after more than three months.
It is a "pipe drink" that continues the prohibitions and risks North Korea's opposition to the U.S. report on the end of the Korean war.

Paris Fashion Shows Releases the latest line of the big headquarters on your nearby high street
If you want to increase your top collection or block the entire sun, you don't need to see anymore.
The designers opened a concept of oversized head gear for their collection of SS19 in Valentino and Thomas Brown's Ranway, which gave the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a very unreliable top is left in Instagram, and these designers have sent their eyes to create the footsteps of Kattawa.
Valentino's first creation was an over-the-sized top beige tope that was equipped with a wide-ranging belt like a pallet that held the heads of the models in.
Along with other oversized accessories, a wizard's top includes even a donkey - but it's not designed to keep your head warm.
Theme Brown also released a selection of an amazing face - and the same for Halloween at the right time.
Many colorful faces were sealed and seen like Hannibal Lector as a terrifying fun.
A creation with a snorkeling and google looks similar to any other glaciated ice cream with a full scooby drilling gear.
And if you're running a great fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylish observers have predicted that big banners can go to the high street near you.
The outsized trophies are competing for "La Bomba", a two-foot wide-ranging trophie that has been seen by each of them from Riana to Emily Rataskovsky.
The Kalt Label has sent another major creation to Katwa, a string beech bag that is almost the same as the swim cutting clothing models behind the extremely intoxicated tope.
Paris Fashion Wike was one of the brand-burning raffia bags in the collection of La Reverer SS19 of Jakmas, with a white leather handheld to the top of the raffia freezing.
Stylist Luke Architect Fimiel said: "I hope that in the summer, large larger sizes and beach bags will come to the high streets - because the designer will have so much impact.
John Edward: Language skills are required for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintained a track record of academic excellence, and it continued another exceptional test results in 2018, which is only a result of the success of individuals, industry, music and other communities.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independence School (SCIS) strive to provide their students and parents with the best level of service.
Self-governmental schools aim to prepare for their place as elected professions and as world citizens for more and higher education to their students.
As a educational field that can design and apply a special school course, we continue to view modern language as a popular and preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, it's on his head.
If you talk to him in your own language, it's in your heart."
It is a strong reminder that if we want to make relationships and beliefs with people of other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
From the recent results of this year's testing, we see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest rates in the automotive school.
A total of foreign-language students gained 68% higher grade.
According to data from the SCIS’s seventeen-member schools, 72% of students have gained the highest degree in management, while 72% have German studies, 66% and 66%.
This proves that Scotland's autonomous schools support foreign languages as an imperative skill that will certainly be required in the future of children and young people.
The language now, as a matter of choice, is the same as the texture of the Autonomous School and elsewhere of STM matters (science, technology, engineering and geography).
The U.K. Commission for Planning and Scoles has shown in an investigation in 2014 that employers have given the reason to fight in order to fill the shadows, 17 percent of them are responsible for their linguistic skills loss.
More than that, young people are becoming unnecessary to prepare language skills for their future careers.
These skills are required in the world for more potential work opportunities.
Anyone who chooses a career, if they learn second language, will be the real advantage of gaining their lifetime skills in the future.
It automatically allows a multilingual person to be able to communicate directly with foreigners before competing.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults of the United States: According to the survey, 75% of the interviews were not able to speak well in any foreign language, and only 15% of the French were ten-five, and only one language.
This is why investment in language education is now important for today's children.
Multilingual languages, especially the language of the developed economy, will provide a better opportunity for children to find financial jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in their learning languages.
Several schools will be referred to in more classical modern languages, on the other hand, when it comes to play by 2020, others will be considered to learn languages that are most important to you, such as Manderin or Japan.
Whatever your child's interest, you will always have many languages to choose in autonomous schools, with experts in the field of education.
Scotland's autonomous schools are dedicated to providing a educational environment that will prepare children and make them with the necessary skills to succeed in the future, no matter why.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "the ability of international communication."
Automotive schools will provide this choice, diversity and excitement for young people in Scotland.
It is necessary to do it.
John Edward was the director of the Scottish Council of Independent School

Trump's West Virginia's Warrior Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump made a storm of campaigns tonight in West Virginia's Wheeling.
It is the first of the five friendly meetings of Trump in the next week, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The Supreme Court's votes are suspended for its elections to be completed, and Trump is aimed at providing support for the next medium-term elections, as the public is focused on being voted in November after the votes are being made.
What's the time of Trump's Western Virginia meeting tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia's meeting was set at night at 7:00 p.m. It is Saturday, September 29, 2018, tonight.
You can see West Virginia's meetings through the live stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably make a statement on the hearing of the candidate nominated by the Supreme Court, Bret Cavanane, which has risen up due to the complaints of sexual abuse with a expected Senate voting during the FBI investigation.
However, the primary goal of opening these meetings is to help the Republicans face the election of November to achieve some speed.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the following five goals were "to strengthen volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are informed of their majority under the Senate and Representative Councils," trying to protect and expand their majority.
"The Congress' control is as important for its agency that we will travel as much as possible to the state with the entry of the busy campaign season," Trump's spokesman Roythers said.
Today's meeting "may bring supporters from Ohoo and Pennsylvania and may bring coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to Western Virginia Metro News.
Trump has visited West Virginia for the second time since last month, which he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginia Republican Senate's candidate Patrick Maricy, who is behind the mountain.
The politician of Western Virginia University, Simon Header, said, "It is not a very good sign for Marisci that the president should try to encourage him in the field of elections."
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team is hungry in hopes to survive the fight on Sunday
At the end of the three unitary sessions, the forum needed this rider cup on Saturday afternoon.
The role of the Montam Pendulam is a fully developed sports concept, but players really believe it, and the most in this national competition.
So, where's Mohammed going to say?
"They had a six-point lead and it's now four, so I think we've got a little moment now," Jordan Speath said to go on walking for that day.
Europe has the advantages of, of course, the remaining twelve games have four points forward.
As Speaker said, Americans believe there is some help in their way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the forms of Speaker and Justin Thomas who play together every day and both have taken three to four points.
He was very friendly from the beginning to the end and was leading from the front.
With his round running, the shouts were even worse, and when he and Thomas were back on two points after scored two, he played an important role like taking the full square match of four points.
His match won them in 15 was the same kind of shouting, which tells you a lot that he believes that he is not outside the American team.
"You really need to go deeper and think about your own game," Spit said.
This is what every player has now.
It's eighteen for a brand.
In the past two days, the players have gained more points than SPITH and TOMAS, just Francesco Monarchy and Tommy Fletwood, the story of the rider Cup.
It's strange in Europe, but it can't make any mistakes from four to four.
"Moliwood" was the only jacket that didn't smoke any papers on Saturday afternoon, but they escaped the papers on Saturday morning, Friday morning and Friday morning at nine.
The rain, and their power, saw how this excitement was driven to and from the population, seemed to be lost on Sunday, and the Le Golf National with the sun remaining, there was no way to deal with Fletwood or Malinary.
It's good if both are different at the same time.
Although the European honour has come from time to time.
When Alex Nareen was injured, Bob Watson and Web Simpson had some problems with the football hero Sergio Georgia in the morning.
In the first nine years, a boog and two double spaniards and Sweden were thrown into a bush where they could never get up.
On Sunday, though, no one is going to get you out of your body.
The mutual interactions between the footwear, which they advise, which does not recommend and that the strategy can change immediately, is very interesting because it is the fact that it is in the sport and near the forum.
Europe has played well as a team so far and has taken an important lead on the final day, but this forum session has further proved that there is a team of USS hunger for the fight, which has suspicioned something, especially state-state.
Europe won 10-6 leads on the final day of the Rider Cup
On the last day of the Rider Cup, Europe will benefit health benefits from the 10-6-leading leads against the U.S. from the football and forum match on Saturday.
Encouraging Jutty Tommy Flitued and Francesco Molinari have now brought their top four points in the golf course with two leads against the Tiger Woods, which remained smoking.
Thomas Jordan's European team is fighting to rescue the traffic lost in Hazeltin two years ago, winning the series in the 3-1 strike, spreading the wrong Americans in the morning's football.
The U.S. has proposed further resistance to two matches in the forum, but they couldn't fill the game.
The team takes eight points from 12 single matches to recover the traffic on Sunday.
Tanna was the first four-point winner of Flitwood, and he and Malinary, together "Mliud" a wonderful week after the radar's history of the first four-point winner of the first four-point matches in the second match.
When Woods and Patrick Ridge were thrown down in the Forum, they subsequently imprisoned a lost Woods and American Ruki Brain's Decambue more forcefully to lose by 5 and 4.
On Saturday, the two matches that took herself to the ten were sometimes blowing light, but now he has lost 19 matches and ten seven between his football and the 29th of the forum.
Justin Roosevelt returns to partner Henry Stanson at the forum to take a rest for the morning football, Justin Roosevelt, in the 2nd and 1st parade of Brooks Copecker, the world's number one and three.
It is a notorious to the south-west of Paris, although in the day of wind Europe it was not on its own.
The three-time winner Jordan Speath and Justin Thomas set a measurement for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They won 2 and 1 strong wins against Spain's Zon Ram and Yaan Polter in the Force, and the two openings in the Force were lost at 4 and 3 by Harry Polter and Riy McClaughter.
In the history of the rider's cup, only two times a team came back from the four-point loss, although it is only necessary to restore the Phoebe's side troop as now.
After being the second best for two days, however, it appears to be spreading to see Sunday's assaults.
North Korea said it wouldn't be forced to be defeated without 'what' faith.
The North Korean foreign minister said on Saturday that the existing ban is deepening the infidelity of the United States and that there is no chance that the country will leave their nuclear weapons at the same time in the national situation.
According to the World Organization's annual general meeting, North Korea promised last year to close nuclear and nuclear weapons tests, break the nuclear test, and to make it possible to not increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons details."
"We haven't seen any similar reactions in the United States," he said.
"If we have no trust in the United States, we will have no trust in our national protection, and there is no way to unite our arms from the country in this situation."
Although Rei Permanbic described the North Korean accusation against Washington's "resistent" procedure that he was awarded award-winning award in the same way that he was awarded award-winning in North Korea due to slowly taking action, his statement was the same as the reason he was awarded award-winning in the same way that he was awarded award-winning award.
Re 12 June, U.S. President and North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, mentioned a joint statement at the first conference, when he was confronted with the rap rapture when he was confronted with the rapture of the "South Korean rivals."
North Korea is searching for the official end of the war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Beijing must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for strict international bans on North Korea.
"The U.S. has forced the first "weapons" on it and has increased pressure by prohibitions to achieve their purpose, even" they also oppose the announcement of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The idea of action can be at risk on our grounds is an incredible dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the constant ban is deepening our unbelief."
There was no comment on the plan of the second summit between Ri Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Prime Minister took to the United Nations for the first week of the week.
In the past five months instead of Minister Mohodai, the leader of South Korea, Moun Ja-in, said in three meetings: “If the issue of violence was not in the United States, it would be in South Korea.”
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was notably different from last year, when he told the U.S. General Council to target the U.S.'s original earthquake with the North Korean rocket when he called "Miss Evil President" Trump "suicide" Kim.
In the United Nations, Trump threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year, he praised Kim for his courage to take action in the field of defence, but he said that he still has to do a lot of work and the prohibitions must continue.
Trump said there was no time limit for it, he said, "If it took two, three or five months to do so, it wouldn't happen."
China and Russia have argued that Beijing should be awarded for the action taken by the UN Security Council
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey also reported to Americans. On Thursday the Security Council said: "The prohibitions of the Defense Council should not be effectively maintained. As long as we take the most effective measures."
The Security Council has increased prohibitions on North Korea from 2006 to close the supply of funds in Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic weapons operations.
Pompeu also met with the United Nations General Council in Istanbul and said he would visit Beijing again in the next month to prepare the second conference.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't good.
When he left Beijing in July, he said that some progress has happened, only for North Korea to "require" him for a few hours until it comes!
North Korea has promised to break a missile site and a New Zealand complex this month if the United States accepts "a different system."
He said that Kim had said he was looking for "coherent steps," that was Trump's security warranty in Singapour and his security warranty to normalize relationships with Washington.
Students in Harvard are taking sufficient rest courses.
This year, a new course of caffeine-gathering at Harvard University, which was completed in the night of the Awakening of the Nights, is giving all of its artists a way to sleep more to tackle the growing culture of the night of the Awakening of the Nights.
A teacher has discovered that students of the world's number one university are often confused about how they will take care of themselves.
Harvard Medical School's doctor and medical professional athlete Charles Sigler created this course, which he believes is the first in the United States.
After giving a speech on what had impacted the lack of sleep on the educational field, he inspired to start the course.
At the end of this, a girl came to me and said, 'Why did you tell me this time, that I came to Zion?'
She said, "No one ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told Telegraph.
This course, such as the first time this year, explains how the best habits of sleep help students in academic and athletic performance, and as well as the need to improve their general health.
Paul Barrera, Head of the Department of Health of the Harvard Medical School, said the students were seriously discharged from sleep in the week after the school began the course.
There are a few post-accounts in the course for an hour.
A department has an image of a student cake, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and lighting by clicking on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books and how athletic performance will be affected by sleep loss.
In other sections, participants are told how long-term sleep baking can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, disappointment and cancer
A map of the campus with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
However, we believe that they have the right to know - such as taking your decision to eat cigarettes, they also have the right to know the effects on health," the President added.
“Waking up at night” is still a growing problem of sleeping because of the rising pressure on modern technology and students.
A student should be a 'secret weapon' to fight your enough quality sleep to ensure stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even making sleeping pain the brain harmless, increasing their constant hunger."
The 19-year-old Remond So, Professor Ciglar, at the University of California in Chemical and Physical Sciences, helped design the course, also took a class at his first year in Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes to ask all students to complete a study program before joining the competitive foundation.
Attorney Ciglar recommended that students should go to bed and also consider the issue of an alert installation for it when to go to bed and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" displayed by the electric screen and LED light.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The loss of the hunters of Mangar Golgor Gerard.
Deli Mengar Gole, Stephen Gerard's Elomélo team won another Aoe match because of the loss of 1 to 10 goals at Levington.
In St. John's 4-1 game, Ebrox's team was watching another victory, but Gary Holt's team won Gerard's second victory as manager of the 18th match.
Menga was injured seven minutes ago, but hopefully the Rangers line-up could never stop them.
Rangers is now going down to sixth, Livingston is rising up to third, and behind the hibernation in the gap difference.
And there may be further problems for the Rangers because of any objects that were cut to the Aoe's edge, Linsman Cam had to be treated for head damage to Spain.
The team has changed eight, which has raised the top to the Beethoven Cup semi-final.
On the other hand, Holt went to the same Livy 11 which took a point from the Hearts last week and was proud of her being excited about how the opponent was breathing.
Ranger's balls may have power, but Livingston has done more with their balls.
When Mengar first sent Scott Patman to Le-Of McGregor's goal, they had to be scored in only two minutes, but Midfielder had lost his great opportunity.
A long free-cock officer of Kagan Jacobs received Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Litho was able to kill the ball only in the backpost.
Rangers' control had restarted, but they had more hope of playing at the final stadium than their beliefs.
Alfredo Morlos felt that he and Stephen Lales were supposed to have his panel in Quarter-Awair due to the conflict, but Ref. Stephen Thomson was rejecting the application of Columbus.
Rangers could only score two shots in the first half, but the former Ebrox Guillermo, Liam Kelly, was a little troubled by the head of Culivalir and the Ov Airer's shots.
The Livy's 34-minute opening goal might have been against the slot, but no one can deny that they're the only one to play this designer.
Rangers has failed to fight the dep set-ps of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react because of the release of Dean Galgarer's Scott Robinson ball, he kept the head cold to take the menu for general fineshing.
Gerard took a break with Ryan Cant to change the club and the change was about to work with him because Wingar was in Morals, but great Kelly left him from the line to block.
However, Livingston observers began to play exactly what kind of game they enjoy, sending a long ball after Litgo and Halkect long.
Holt's team could also take their final lide stages, but rushed to destroy McGreeger's attempts to defeat Jacobs before heading from Litho Corona.
The sub-section of Ranger's sub-section of Leto Panel with Jacobs, with a whit drink, resigned again in the claim of Glen Middleton.

And now a page of our "Sanday Marning" in Albania: 30 September, 1822, today from 136 years ago ... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany in the future.
The guitar has created a method for detecting and measuring gravity, it is a discovery that is known to the end as the guitar calculator.
Since then, a fundamental foundation of science, Gaigar Counter has also become the fundamental foundation of a pope culture, in 1950 in the film "Beles of the Coronado", the potential in the film: Kupock scientist Ray Racers and Del Eve.
"What is it again?"
"It is used to identify electrical minerals such as uranium, a guitar computer.
When you give these iphones, you can hear the nuclear effects caused by tension among minerals. "

The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify devastated coils.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify and kill devastated coils.
The vaccine is taught to identify immune systems in the form of the treatment of the immune system.
The method includes the removal of antibodies from the patient and the modification of them in the lab.
Then they can see a common protein for many cancers and then re-infiltrate.
A test vaccine has shown hopeful results with cancer patients at different levels.
A woman who is treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to detect devastating coils, has seen her cancer in the vagina become invisible for more than 18 months.
In the procedure, the anti-corrosive coils are removed from the patient, they are changed in the test so that they can "see" the common proteins of many cancers called HER2 and then involve re-infiltration of the coils.
J. Berzowski, CEO of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very desperate vaccine."
"Her2" explains the increase in various types of cancers, including Breast, Dembash, Fosfox and Colloretal Cancer, Professor Barzafsky explains.
Disease prevention of disease outside patients and "how can be targeted by cancer" has also worked the same kind of methods to treat them for "teaching" leukemia.
Kane's western NSA has joined the pro-Trump campaign after a MAGA series
It wasn't good.
Kanie West was released in the studio after a devastating performance during the nightlife in Seattle, where he praised President Donald Trump. He said he remained self-sufficiency in 2020.
After serving his third song on the night of the Ghost Town, where he received a Mac America Great Cap, he complained against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white man, they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a barbarian.'"
Well, if I were worried about barbaric, I would have gone out of the United States a long time ago," he said.
The Snl Matt D.D. started a show with a sketch where Hollywood's star Christian Blagie Ford enjoyed witnessing the Senate's audiovisual committee on the claim of sexual injury by Christine Blagie Ford.
Although it wasn't published, western actor Chris Rock uploaded in social media.
It wasn't clear if he tried to give the West to the post.
He also accused Western audiences of having to face backpack problems with his head as well.
"They took me on the back of my back.
They said, "You won't go out later."
They gave me a shit!
And then they say that I'm in a dough, according to the source of Washington Xamina.
West also said, "Do you want to see the place?" He said, "You'll read the Superman Cup, because that means you can't tell me what you're going to do." "Do you want to see the world to be awarded?
Try with love."
His comments have been busted at least twice since the visitor, and the members of the S.N.Kast felt confused, the warranty said, where a person told the publication: "The old studio had a quiet paint."
West was introduced as an alternative to the musician Iran Grand, whose ex-lover, Laper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
The Western I.L.W. is confusing many in the performance of the song, decorating a pair like a bottle.
The Western conservative group TPUSA has received support from the chief commander of the TPUSA, who tweeted: "Thank you for standing in front of the destructors one of the seventh spirits: thank you for standing in front of the destructors."
However, Tocoso's representative Karen Hunter tweeted that the West was "what was so and he was absolutely great."
"When I chose not to be awarded to anyone (buy his music or clothing or his" industry "supporting") who are linking and spreading to the harmful ideals for my community.
He is independent.
And we also said, "He added.
Before the show, this reporter announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
D is not the first artist who has changed his name and has followed his path to a DVD, known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and P DVD.
Another similar lap, Snow Dog's name was Snow Leon and, of course, the music princess, who had changed her name to a prince who was previously known as the prince.

The game of the Thrones star Kitt Harington attacked the toxic masculine or toxic humanity.
Kit Harington is known for the role of the assaulting medieval fantasy series Game of the Thrones in Zone Snow.
But this 31-year-old actress Macho Hero's stereotype said that playing a national role in Perth means that young boys would have to think that if they receive their respect, it would be hard.
When Kit talked to Sande's Times, he believed that something was wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of #MeToo's toxic maskline.
Kit, who recently married Rog of Thrones' supporter at the age of 31, admitted that he felt strong about the problem.
"I personally, I feel very thorough, at this moment - where are we doing wrong in human beings?"
"When we were older, what did we teach them that we are facing this problem?"
Kit believes that the television toxic masculine can be partially responsible for its extremely masculine characters.
He also said, "What are we learning and what are we learning?
What is taught on TV and streets that children think they should follow this specific path if they are men?
I really think it's one of the most important questions in this time - how do we change it?
Because it's obvious that some major mistakes have happened to young people.'
In an interview, he further admitted that when the series will be new in the next summer, he won't play any game of Thrones prejudice or secular, he said he finished the life of 'war and horses'.
From November to November, Kit Sam Shappar will play in the rebuild of the western Triumph, which tells a filmmaker and his brother-in-law.

Rose Emma won the Fantasy Series in Egypt, the character of John Snowy.
The couple married Lazleri in Scotland in June 2018 at the family's estate.
HIV/AIDS: China has revealed a 14% increase in new events.
China has announced a 14% increase in HIV and HIV infections.
There are more than 82,000 people in the country, health officials said.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, nearly 40,000 new events have been reported.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual infection, which has changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly to various parts of China for bloodstreaming.
However, the number of HIV-infected people has been dropped on the road, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yunan province.
Although every year, the number of living people, including HIV and AIDS, is rising to 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV infection is a serious problem in the LGBTI community in China.
In 1997, homosexuality was legalized in China, but the LGBTI is still considered to be a violation of the legitimacy against the people.
Due to the country's sustainability assessment, the research estimates that 70-90% of men engaged in sex with men, marrying women later.
Many disease infections come from inadequate sexual protection in the case of this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged public entry to the HIV medicine as part of the challenge of this problem.
Maxine Waters rejects information from GOP Senators, "Dangerous Lies" and "Mediatric Theories"
The U.S. Republican Maxin Waters on Saturday rejected the complaint that one of its employees has posted on the Wikipedia page of personal data lawmakers of three Republican U.S. Senators.
The Los Angeles Democrates insisted that these claims are being promoted by "Alternative Rings" and websites.
"Myths, lies, and more hate lies," said Walters on Twitter.
The U.S. Senators' home addresses and telephone numbers have been reported in the published information. The Senate. The South Carolina Line, and Mike Lee and Orin Hacks, are both users.
This information was published online on Thursday, an unknown person was posted as the capital of the Senate panel during the hearing of the Senate panel's accusations of sexual abuse against Bret Cavanana, appointed by the Supreme Court.
A few minutes later, after the three Senators had questioned the Cavanate.
Protective sites like Gateway and Redstate have reported that the source identification of the post was associated with the IP address "Waters" office and disclosed any information from the employees, Hill reported.
"This is an undisputed lie and a perfect lie," Walters continued.
"My employees - whose knowledge, personal information and protection have been accused of this fraud and false accusations - were in no way responsible for the arrest of this information.
This is an unfair allegation and a perfect lie."
The White House's early press conference at the White House's White House has been criticized by many on the internet.
"This is a denial," Flishar wrote.
"It says that Congress does not have a tendency to become a member.
When anyone is accused of what they haven't done, they won't be angry.
They will certainly not be opposed.
They should not be asked about the purpose of the accused.
They must be calm and quiet."
Flishar compared the reaction of Walters with the criticism of Democrates on the case of the judge's canon, and critics on Thursday said that he was very unfair.
The Republican candidate Omar Navuro, who is electing to show who was going to water in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It's big," he tweeted.
In his statement, Walters said that his office has warned the upcoming authorities and law enforcement agencies about these alleged claims.
"We will make sure that the criminals will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my employees and all of them."
Johnny English Strikes Again's Review - Poor Royan Atkinson's Secrets
It is now traditional and seems to have been applied to revive in life in any new pictures including the British turkeys to see the Brexit value and it has begun to revive Johnny's English Action-Camedy SpongeBox in life - which came back with Johnny's English in 2003 and began with 20
How much will we be able to do with this self-sacrifice?
Any rate, pop-cut, rubber-fashioned Johnny has a license to create new things for the second time to England - his name indicates that he is designed for a smaller range of other languages than the English film world.
He is of course a foolish secret representative who, despite the tendency of Modern Jackmack, was somewhat old, a dance and a drop-off of Mr. Binn in London, a opening of the Olympics in 2012.
He was basically based on Traveller and acted in the forgotten Barclaycard TV ads of international mystery Atkinsone once forgotten, spreading widespread knowledge.
This is one or two great moments at the end of the day.
I liked to see Johnny's English come to a helicopter in a slight helicopter with the rotary blades after the medieval brass dress.
The gift of Atkinsone for physical characters is shown, but the risk has been felt very low and strangely over-the-counter, especially the "Syria" movies like 070 and the mission impeccable. The brand is now a component of self-confidence.
The risk seems to have been targeted to adults, and I think that the accidents in the strange english of Benny's personality are not such an innovative and centrifugal as the Atkins' quiet-kine clutcher.
Over the years, the topical basis is a serious problem in the UK.
A cyber hacker entered the super-secret web network of Britain's secrets, for the publicity of all British agents in the field, for the disappointment of the responsible agent - a misfortune for Kevin Elddon.
It is a prime minister's ultimate trust that has already suffered a total disruption of political opposition, he's a bitter and obsessed personality: Emma Thompson has played her best in this half-time character, but there's not much more than to work on the script.
His Goianda advisors told him that every active secretary has been accused, so he has to remove someone from the retreat.
And it means to book the English, which is now established as a school teacher in a number of institutions, but how to learn outside the record about it as a teacher: there are some good characters here, because the English is a Goeundagi's Rank-Rack.
The British returns to Whitehall for emergency briefing, and Ben Miller's actress again has been reconnected with his former long-lived side-by-budge.
Bue is now a married person, married to a sub-American commander, the role of a jelly-haki-stack whose Vicky-paperdine has been deprived of some.
So the interest rate was faced by Batman and Robin once again in the act of misleading at the Secret Service of the Majesty, Olga Koreanko's wife, Ophelia Boulevard.
At the same time, Prime Minister Carismetic has been dangerously detected in the magic of Billionaire, who claims to be able to solve the problems of British computers: Jack Lace's guilty actor Jason Volta.
The English and the Bue starts the strange sound of their remote high-gen: they fire in a flash French restaurant in the waters; they push the vessel into the vessels with the use of the vessels in the valley and the vessels in the valley; they start to crawl themselves and run out of the vessels in the waters.
All stops of course have been taken to the end, but it's just as bad and upsetting, there are a lot of children's TV thoughts on the whole issue.
It's a very medium staff.
And I couldn't think, like other English films, that British filmmaker Ryan Atkinson couldn't play a role that really justifies his role?
Labar refuses to make plans to work four days a week for the UK, but it will be paid for five days.
Jeremy's labour party will consider a major plan that the British will work for four days a week - but it's getting paid for five days.
According to the report, the company's owners want to share the money saved by employees with an additional day holiday through the revolution.
It will be able to enjoy the three-day holidays of employees - but it will still be in the same home.
According to the source, this concept will be 'fit' with the group'' economic workout and there is a plan to move the country to workers.
The Trade Union Congress has allowed workers to transfer a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
"A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year, according to a senator's source, Sande's Times.
"This night won't happen, but four-day workdays are an aspiration that is worried by the team's methods of maintaining balance in the economy for the overall industry as well as the workers."
The first non-Lab party to support this national idea, the Green Party promised four-day workdays during their general election campaign in 2017.
It is currently not supported by the Libra party, although it is not supported.
A spokesman from Labar Party said: "This is not a four-day party policy and it is not considered a team leader."
Shado Chancellor John McDonald's last week's Labour Conference used his views for a social revolution in the economy.
Zhanab McDonald's said he was strongly selective to give power to "unknown managers" and "winners" in eligible companies.
The current shareholders of the Shado Chancellor's finance plan may not return their entire part because the labour government may give something 'left' because of the misconceptions that the labour government is supposed to do.
He also planned to hold employees at the board for 10 per cent of private layer companies to provide justice to employees, with an annual amount of $50 per cent standing.
According to Graham, John Kennedy said "60 minutes" that the investigation into the FBI could change their minds.
The FBI's Supreme Court's investigation into the complaint against Bret Kavanah has delayed its final vote on the nomination for at least a week, and the business investigations have caused any Republicans to turn their support to the Senate.
In an interview announced on Sunday, reporter Scott Peli asked the Republican Senators if the FBI could discover something that they could change their minds in John Kennedy and Linda.
He was more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
"Man, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you.
After the incident, I called him, and the accusation came out, and I said, "What did you do?"
He was strong and unfair."
The vote of Graham, of course, seems irreversible.
"My brethren's mind has been created and a very important charge will need to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Bret has strongly denied it," Christian Blake Ford added.
"And whose name he said he couldn't check.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see any new changes."
What is the Global Cities Festival and what does it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Cities Festival in New York, an annual musical event that has a great line-up of star performance and a equally curative mission; the removal of world poverty.
In the seventh year of this year, the Global Cities Federation will only see thousands of people turning to the Central Park's Greater Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shan Mendes. This is not the fact that it is not the most important event in the year 2030, but the most important event in the year 2030.
The Global Cities Festival, described in 2012, is an expansion of the global poverty project, which is an internationally active campaigning team of increasing the number of people fighting actively.
To get a free ticket for the event (if you don't want to pay for the VIP tickets), concertors have multiple tasks or "activity" such as volunteer work, e-mailing a way to help others, calling a phone or any other disadvantages.
But how many years have been successful in achieving the Global Cities?
The idea of rewarding people through what kind of concert is the real step in order to encourage people to take action, or another case of so-called "cliquity" - where people think they are getting an application on the internet
Since 2011, the Global City is saying it has recorded more than 19 million "access" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says that these measures have helped world leaders declare an equal promise and policy of over $37 billion, which will affect the lives of 22.2 billion people in 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the team gave 393 promises and announcements, which began with its activity, including at least $10 billion already being distributed or collected.
According to the team, the Protected Tehbil has had a direct impact on nearly 464 million people around the world.
A few of the main promises are the power supply, the UK-based investors and the partnership of implementers "aids children to increase their full chances." Over the next three-hour goals of gaining up to four, seventy-five global cities.
"With the help of the British government, the Dad, the National Government, and the Global Cities, we can become a part of the social crimes of Austin as a part of history," Trump said in April of London.
The team also said that after taking more than 5,000 steps in the United States to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced the payment of money for a project, which will take the power off-news.
The answer to the frequently asked question on its website: "Who do you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
The Global City said, "This will be a long and strong path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights and anti-barbarism movement before us, we will be successful, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shan Mendes, Cardi B, Genève Moni is one of those who will perform this year's event to New York, one of which will be executed by Deborah-Li-Frances and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use naval forces to prevent fuel refueling
Washington can take refuge in its naval forces to prevent Russian fuel from coming in the Middle East countries, according to the US' internal Chief Ryan Gink, according to Washington's exhibit's description.
Genek accused the involvement of Russia in Syria - notably, where it is working in the invitation of the legal government - of seeing the new fuel market.
"I believe that the cause of their location in the Middle East is because they want to deploy electricity like the Southern Central Europe," he said.
And there are ways and means of adopting this according to the lawyer.
"The U.S. and our Navy have the power to free the sea, and if it is necessary, prevent their fuel from going to the market," he said.
Zenke spoke to participants in an event organized by an unprofitable group of Conjumar Energy Allens, which recognizes the "fuel customers' voices" in the United States.
He compared the use of Washington to Russia and Iran in real matters.
"The tax to keep Russia in custody with the dependent economy of Jibashm fuel," he said, "is linked to the benefit and replacement of Iran and Russia's financial alternatives from less fuel," he said.
Trump's administration in return to Russia, such statements have been made to European customers in Europe with a view to keeping natural gas shipping in many ways.
This is the fact that U.S. President Donald Trump himself is trying to bring the German "unconnected" Nord Stream 2 from pipeline project. It is being pushed back to, like Trump's
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the US$11 billion stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the current pipeline capacity, is ready to take 110 billion cubic meters - it is totally financially savings.
Cremlin's reason is that the cause of Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financially and it is an example of an uncomfortable competition.
"I believe we agree that it is not possible to be used as a means of supplying fuel and that the supplier should have the power to choose," said the Russian fuel department's minister, Alexander Nowack, in Moscow after September.
The U.S. situation has resulted in a negative reaction from Germany, and Germany has reaffirmed that the project is inadequate.
In the industrial case, Germany's leading company Federation of German Industry (BDI) has stated that the U.S. remains far from the bilateral agreement between the European Union's fuel policy and Berlin and Moscow.
"After the recent meeting held between Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Federation of Germany's Industry (BDI) - is one of the main problems of our major reporters, says our fuel management.
Elisabeth Warren "will see the candidates for the president's 2020 paid," the Senate of Massachusetts said.
Elisabeth Warren, senator of Masachusetts, said on Saturday that he would "see the candidate for the candidates for the presidential elections after the incoming elections."
When a town of Holey's in Mascusette, Warren assures that he's in the contest.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up the government to read against us, including the arrival of women in top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I'll be elected to the president's competition."
The Warren Town was on the move as President Donald Trump said, "Trump is driving the country on the wrong path.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing about our democracy," he said.
Warren Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominated Bret Kavanagh's criticism.
Warren said in a tweet on Friday, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before voting."
In an investigation published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters don't think they should fight in their 2020 elections.
The Center for Political Research of the University of Saffok/Boston Globe has been investigated by Mascusette's "potential" votes, saying that the Senate should not fight.
The thirty percent of the fight supported it.
According to the ex-Government's Devall Patrick's votes, 38 percent supported potential battles and 48% did not support.
Other potentially discussed high profile democracy names include former Vice-President John Biden and Barney Sanders, the Senate of Varmington.
The Associated Press said Biden would officially make a decision in January.

The 26-year-old trailer Palin has spent a year in Iraq after his listing in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in an internal violence case.

18 Kingdoms, DC support the challenges of new asylum policy
The Eighth District of Colombia supports the legal challenge against the new U.S. policy, which rejects refugees who escaped from gang or family violence.

He said that his companion "And his violent gay members" gave him a rape, but the U.S. officials rejected his application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
As a country facing the problems of gay and family violence, the supporting government actors give examples of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemallar, from which a large number of refugees are being applied to the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy issued an appeal board's 2014 decision to allow unregistered immigrants who fled for family violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement by the District of Columbia, General Carlo Rezin said the new policy "has implemented the rule, federal and international law for decades."
The Friend-Ab-De-Court Brif said, "The application of all refugees under this federal law should be judged according to specific information and situation and violate the main purpose of the national prohibition."
In the statement, the actors further argued that the denial of immigrants' entry policy has been damaged to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become an entrepreneur and they "provide the necessary job."
Attori General Jeff's immigration sessions orders judges not to refrain from abuse of family violence and gay violence in June.
"Religious people, religion, nationality, or a particular social group can be granted refuge for members or political views or for fears that have to leave their own country," the session said in a statement on June 11.

The number of deaths between the attempts to rescue lives doubled and the attempts to rescue Maria in Palu
The situation was scary for the survivors.
"The 35-year-old Resa Kusuma said it was very worried to comfort her burning child in the city asylum centre," he said.
"There's a dead body every minute in ambulances.

U.S. government accused China of "gagagali" through propaganda advertising
A week after a government Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper, the U.S. government has pushed the U.S. government to use targeted campaigns against the Beaging State.
U.S. President Donald Trump has mentioned the largest Chinese Daily Dace Mins Record Supplement last Wednesday and has participated in the U.S. Congress election on November 6, China. China's intervention attempt
Trump is accused of attempting to interfere in the US elections, which US officials say is a new attempt in Washington to push China.
It is a normal event that the foreign government will advertise for the promotion of trade, but it is currently undergoing a trade war in Beijing and Washington, which has led to an increase in the amount of sales in each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that this trade war first was built to damage republicans in the UK, such as Iwa, who supported the Trump Republican party.
The U.S. government and the long-term former governor of Iowa, Terry Branded, a major farmer in agriculture in China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
According to a Sunday's Dead Mins register, China "is now doubled the report by using our own self-governmental advertising."
"In promoting money payments in the Daisy Mines Register, the Chinese government is taking the unrealistic advantages of the red-based history of the American freedom and free media," he said.
"On the other hand, on the street of Beijing, you will find a limited opposition in Newcastle, and you will not see its real opposition to the Chinese people on what kind of anxiety they may have about the economic path of China.
He further said that his writing "refuted to print a prominent journalist in China," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
The Republicans want to keep the women's voters away before the mediatorm, analysts warned
Many of the top Republicans have been warned by the Supreme Court's Namini Bret Kavanaf to stand next to several accusations of sexual assault, and the analysts have warned that they will be active in the coming midterm elections, especially from women.
It is evident that the feelings of this issue have been finally increased and most Republicans have already publicly wanted to move forward by voting.
In an article published on Saturday, Syracuse's Maxwell School of State Director Grant Rehar, said, "These can't come back in any way."
Rehar said that the pressure of Senator Jeff Fleck (Ar Arizona) in the last moment for the FIB investigation would calm the poor voters, he doubted.
According to Washington D.C.'s Progressive Movenon Group Advisor and National Women's Speaker, Karin Jean-Pay, said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and November."
Despite the testimony of Dr. Christin Blagi Ford on the nomination of Kavanaf, the Judgment Committee of the Controllers of the Republicans has decided to move forward on Friday morning. "The protesters are on Friday morning.
"Normal political analyst Stew Rheinbarg has said this news site," he said he will be past as a democratic excitement and inspiration.
"They say that there's already much more; that's true.
However, this may be more, especially among the city's popular female voters and among young voters aged 18 to 29 years old, who do not vote because they don't like the president."
Even before the Supreme Court appointed a candidate, analysts also advised that if the Republicans progress with permission, it could be a distorted reaction.
"This has become a complicated issue for the GOP," former chairman Michael Steel NBC news told the Republican National Committee last week.
"It's just going to be backed by the committee's votes or final votes or the Caffè, it doesn't matter whether the Republicans have taken the matter and how it has been used with it" Prioritys said in the Group of the United States of America.
Nevertheless, who should believe about the evidence of Ford and Kavanaf, the Americans seemed to be somewhat dubious about it, the opinion of the next person was severe.
A new study in Yugoslavia has shown that 41 percent of respondents believe or possibly the testimony of the Ford, where 35 percent say they believe of course or possibly Kafanf.
It has also been found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaf had probably or of course lied at the time of accepting his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about the Ford.
Following Fleck's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and the newest other prosecutor, Debora Ramirez, according to the Guardian report.
Ford swore to the court in front of the Department of Justice last week that he was sentenced to death at the age of 17 in Kavanaf Ness.
Ramirez accuses him of showing his own sexual relations in the 1980s during the Icelandic schooling.
The developer of the World Wide Web for youth with Google and Facebook has planned to launch a new Internet.
World Wide Web's innovative team is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technology's latest project, Infrapt, is a company that will create a solid platform for Barners-Lira open-source.
Solidarity users are entitled to choose where their data will be stored and to have permission to access people in any information.
In a single interview with the Fast Company, Barners-Li said that the actual purpose of Infrapt was "universal power."
"We have to do that now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
This app allows everyone to create a "private online data store" using solid technology.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browsers and simultaneously.
The unique about the personal data store is that it will fully depend on the user - who can access any kind of information.
The company called the name "personal power through data."
According to CIO John Bruce, the company will help to gain all the resources, processes and appropriate capabilities for the idea of Input.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased from Barners-Ley, Bros, IBM, a team of contracted non-staff developers and volunteer codeders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own centralized applications using the existing tools on the Internet site.
Bernard Lee said he and his team wouldn't be talking about "whether there is a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models will be completely changed at night."
"We don't want to allow them."
In a press release published on Saturday, Burner-Lie wrote that "Input's point is to provide commercial fuel and an inventory to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Barners-Li Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded the World Wide Web Consortium and changed the Internet.
Over the past few months, the network has emerged as a strong voice voice against Barners-Li.
This will also be the founder and director of the Barners-Li World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute during the run.
"I am unexpectedly hoping about the future of the web," Barners-Ley added.
Bernard Van: Victory Cross Class of the First Explosion War
The city's centuries celebrate the Church of England's only priest who won the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior.
He won the Bernard Van's award at the time of the attack on 29 September 1918 in Belengles and Lehancott.
Anyway, he was killed four days later in the hands of a suspect and he never knew he had received the highest respect for the British military.
On Saturday, his two grandmothers opened his memory in a knife in russian Northamptonshaer.
His grandmother Michael Van said it was "excellent worthwhile" that the opening of this memory was just 100 years later of his grandfather's cartoon.
According to the London Gate on September 29, 1918, Lefthant Canal Van "leaded his Bethelian among the vast holes of the Gulf Coach and Field and Machinegane" was led by D'Sent-Coantin Canal Perorna's time.
Then he goes to the fire line and leads the line along with "Serbotch's courage" and only brings a field song along with him and gives three enemies a break.
Colonel Leftmann Van was killed in the hands of a German warrior on October 4, 1918 - only a month ago the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's work was "one thing I could never do and that's a great respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchawaz, completed the cleansing of the young band, who was led by the Bruned Imperial Young Band.
Michael Van said, "I feel greatly respected for the part of the Parade," and further said, "A real breast rigidity is demonstrated in support of many people."
The MM's followers woke up to visit 206 ballots all night, but instead they got Pepa Pig.
Remember that you've spent the whole night watching a great ballot 206 and haven't been shown to be the main event.
The main bill card received from San Hose was sixty-two feet, and the channel was shown live throughout the night in U K.
In the morning, when Gagard Mosachi and Riy McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage was changed to Pepa Peggy and surprised the British visitors.
Especially because of this night they were awake until yesterday, so some people were hungry.
A follower on Twitter describes the cartoon of children as "like naked risks."
"They were forced to show children's cartoons at 6:00 a.m.," Belatore's co-president Dave Shawarz said in response to the broadcast.
"Daddy, yes, yes."
Belato's president Scott Koker said he would work on preparing a timeline to discuss the future of the UK's visitors.
"We'll probably be able to solve it in the time of the revolt."
"We will not be able to do this until Sunday morning at 6:00 p.m. and we will not be able to do this until Sunday.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when it's switched, there's a lot of messages coming later and they weren't very friendly.
We tried to correct it, we thought it might be a technical mistake.
No, it was the government.
I promise that this won't happen the next time.
We will reduce it to five lights instead of six - as we usually stay - that's what has happened in an extra effort to give fans more.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Disc: Tom Delly was "infinite" due to sexuality.
The Olympic driver, Tom Deli, said that when he grew up, he was imminently defeated due to sexuality, but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand that "everybody wasn't like me" before he went to school.
When Lauren Lavarn introduced the first radio on the Iceland 4 Dessert disc, he said he spoke about homosexual rights in giving others a "hope" to them.
He also said that after the birth of his son, his thoughts on his Olympic victory have decreased.
The representative of Christie Ying has been on holiday for a long period of time due to the disease.
When Lavarn's first event was present as a society, Deli said he felt "small" than everyone else, because "the choice of children-girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, "To this day, it has been real to think of the little thing and to feel different, which has given me strength and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove himself as "something" so that when everyone can know about his sexuality, they won't be disappointed.
The winner of the two-bar Olympics, Bronze Padk, has become the pro-Profil LGBTI, and has worked to apply for more countries in Australia to recognize homosexuality in the Companionwalt Games this year.
He said he opened his mouth, because he thought he was lucky to be able to survive publicly without complexity and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world championship said that reading a man's love – American filmmaker Dennis Lance Black, with whom she was seen in 2013 - "which surprised me."
Deli married this Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her. He said there was no problem with the age.
"When you were so young," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died in cancer after three years, he said that it was difficult to find someone like that in his life that he saw so fast.
The couple had born a son named Robert Ra Black-Deli in June, saying that his "old view" has changed.
He said, "If you asked me last year, I would say, 'I have to win a gold medal', that's my mind.
"Truly, there are more things than the Olympics.
"Rabbi is my Olympic golden man."
His son's name is his father Robert, who died of brain cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Dale said her father had never admitted that she was going to die, and she had finally asked if London had been sure their tickets for 2012 - because she wanted to stay in the first series.
"I could never say, 'You will not be sitting in the first series anymore'," he said.
"When she breathed, I caught her hand and left her last confidence and died, and I didn't admit she was in oppression," he said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronzepick.
He said, "This was a dream of my whole life - given the Olympics to its visitors, there's nothing better than it."
It also encouraged her first song - the puddle of Hida Smel - which was accompanied by her in the preparation of the Olympics and which still lets her crash in her head.

Michaelson will be sitting in a cup of rider on Saturday.
U.S. film Michaelson won a record in his 47th team rider Cup match on Sunday, but if he doesn't want to make it unfortunate, he'll have to return to his form.
Michaelson, who played 12 times this double-year event, was sitting on the bank in exchange for Captain Jim Furrick on Saturday.
Instead of staying in the center of Halshal, which he was playing in the United States, this five-year-old winner has cut off the day of the Chiaralidar working and busy playing his own game in Range.
Even in the top of Kerry drivers, this 48-year-old Tit is not suitable for the National Golf Course, where the long raff is often struggling with long shots.
And if the course isn't bad enough, Michaelson, the 9th match, is faced with the British Open Championship Francesco Molinoir, who plays with Ruki Tommy Flywood, taking their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have four points below at the beginning of the 12 Singles Match, can start well, Michael's match can be proven important.
Furrick has shown her confidence, although there wasn't much to say.
"Today, he has fully understood his role, put his hand on my neck and said he's made for tomorrow."
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's been a member of the team and has given him a lot over the past few weeks.
I probably didn't think they would play two games.
I was hoping that, but that's what we've been thinking about, and that's how we've been thinking about.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Michaelson will be recorded in the most rider Cup matches in the game on Sunday.
It can take the rider's cup to the carriage, which can't even be taken into account by his personal record.
Michaelson's win has 18 wins, 20 rates, and seven hafs, although Furic said his presence is enchanting the team.
"Of course, a funny man, a smart man, a man likes to be in the field, like being in a team room, and a great man," he said.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him, too, this week, which I really liked to see.
It's more than just playing."
Capt. Thomas Burrn knows that the great Ledo can be invisible
Thomas Burn, the European captain, knows from the experience that in the last day of the rider's cup, the grandfather Lead could also create an irregular situation in Single.
Dean's first release was held in 1997 in a lovely match, where the leading team of Savi Ballesteros had won five points to Americans, but only in the most complicated margin, the final line was at some point in 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-132<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2
"You remember that our great goods were our great leader; our great leader was in Brooklyn, where we lost, and our great leader, where we lost, but the names were winning," Burn said in the 10th and 6th of the year.
The story will show me and all of the team that it hasn't finished yet.
Tomorrow is the name of the full source.
Name and do the right job in the field.
There is no point at the board until it's over.
We have a goal, that's to try to win Trophy, and that's to keep our birds' eyes.
I've always been saying that I'm looking at 12 players in my team, but we're very conscious of who he is, the best players in the world."
I'm glad that our players have worked so hard at the hard golf course. "I'll never be too confident about this.
Tomorrow is a different battle.
Tomorrow it will be a personal performance, and it's a different thing.
When everything goes well, it's great to stay with the partner, but when you're alone in the field, it's a full test of your ability as a golfer.
This message needs to be reached by all players, which everyone has to do the best tomorrow.
This time, you have to get your partner back and get the best of it."
On the contrary, the opponent of Jimmy Furrick will be watched so that players as a team that played personally better, except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who brought three points in between four points.
The "Marvelous Events on the Day" in Europe, as part of the rate and the winning team in Brunei, also gained the second-party experience of the match-to-family on the last day.
In the last day of 1999, she said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of starting quickly like Brunei and Maman.
When the game is at risk, there is a lot of pressure on the middle sides of the game.
"We'll make a line according to it and we'll do what we think we're going to do with the kids, actually we're going to make some magic tomorrow."
Paul C.C., Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Poulter have been given the obligation to lead the top orders against the Europeans. He will be faced with the first match.
"I've made this team more and more, because I think it'll cover it all," Burn said on the election of his singles.
Germany's new warship has been suspended again
According to the local news media, Germany's most prophecy for replacing the previous Cold War-war warships was to be launched with this team in 2014, but it will not be at least until the next year due to the costs of the wrong system and snowballing.
The military spokesman said that the first vessel of the new Budden-Wertemberg-Shrain "Reinland-Flaze" launched was arrested until the first half of 2019.
The ship was involved in joining the Navy in 2014, but the high-speed project has been in trouble due to the future shipping problems.
In 2007, the navy, which ordered the four Budden-Wertemberg-Shrainer ships, will take the place of the Bremen-Class Frigate, which became old.
It is known that it will contain strong bulbs, anti-aircraft and anti-shipping weapons as well as some steel technology, such as reduction radar, infrared and acoustic signaling.
Other important features include the long-term maintenance range - new freights for the most two years from the port of the country will be possible.
Anyway, the meaning of delay is that modern warships - which are talking about helping Germany to exhibit energy abroad - will become old at the time of watering, says Jayt's news.
Last year, the F-125 F-Freight came to the headquarters, when the German Navy refused to launch the vessel, rejecting Hambarg's blue and boss shipyard.
For the first time, the ship was sent back to ShipBlader after the ship was delivered.
It is very little known about the reasons for the return, but the German media indicates a few important "software and hardware errors" that will cause the ship to be obstructed in the war.
The software's bulbs are particularly important, because the navy of Budden-Wertemberg-Shrainer will be run by around 120 nabis crosses - which is half of the people of the old bramen-class freights.
It also showed that the vessel was a large scale of gravity that would reduce its performance and prevent the future of the navy's advancement.
These 7,000 tonnes of "Reinland-Flaught" are considered to be more heavy than the Germans used in the same class ship during World War II.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the cost of the entire project with cruise training is also a problem.
The initial level of 2.2 billion pounds was surprisingly reached at 3.1 billion pounds ($3.6 billion).
The new budgets that have been challenged by the German Navy-Force have become more important for the recent prosecution of the warrior.
At the beginning of this year, the German Parliament Defence Committee's Chief Hans-Peter Bertels admitted that "a suitable ship of Motein is flying to the navy."
The official said that the problem was overwhelmed with time, because the old vessels were cancelled had no substitute vessels.
He regrets the fact that no naval vessels were able to join the naval army of Baden-Wertemberg-Shrainer.
It's not to be heard of the National Trust in the Secret Life of the Army
A new study is being carried out in a set of Scottish regions in order to know how the farmer uses the landscape in the search of food.
The research can be expected to reflect new on the behaviour of this unique flying breeding animal and to assist in future conservation activities.
The research of scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be conducted on general and soprano pipelines, as well as on the Invaryus Gardens of Western Russell, Denton.
In the entire season, the special records will be placed in an important place around the area to track the activity of the barbers.
NHS employees and volunteers will also run the ongoing records using a portable detector.
Analyzing the sound of all recordings by an expert will be made up of the companion of the bulb caller and it will be heard of what kind of species is doing.
Then a landscaped map and reporting will be created to create a large-scale landscaped image of their behavior.
NTS's natural conservation adviser hopes to provide Rab to the results to reveal that any areas of residence are the most important and how it is used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of residence, such as the creation of grounds and how the grounds can be preserved for the species of beef and other related species.
Over the last centuries, the number of Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined extremely.
They are among the risks for building and developing work that damage their sleeping place and residential area.
Air-based turbines and light can also be dangerous, such as some of the chemicals of flypapers and building materials, as well as clothing can be dangerous to attack cats.
It's not really blind.
However, in the case of hunting at night, their ears are more effective than their eyes.
They use an advanced counterparty-place strategy to identify the dangers and obstacles on the road to Wooden.
The NTS, whose responsibility is to maintain more than 270 historic buildings across the country, 38 important farms and 76,000 hectares of land, has given the importance to the farm.
They have ten trained experts who conduct regular examinations, visit the place of sleep and sometimes rescue.
The company has also established the first and only registered storage spaces in Scotland in Damfriez and the Trivest of Galway, where there are eight of the ten species of coconut species in Scotland.
The company's manager David Thompson said it was an ideal area for the farmers.
"There's the best place for three people here," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are many ancient trees, and there are all good places of residence.
However, there is still a lot more unknown about the barber, so we will help us understand more about what we need to do here and elsewhere."
He emphasizes the importance of knowing the presence of cows before maintaining the property, as it can cause 400 cows and children to be destroyed due to the destruction of a mother's residence, and to ensure the total number of local cows.
It is illegal to kill and kill animals or to destroy their home or to destroy them.
The Scottish Police Officer of Trust, Elizabeth Ferel, has been encouraged to help the people.
He said, "We still have a lot to know about gods, and we don't know how many species live."
Ronaldo is accused of crime and lawyers are proceeding against the German newspaper
The accusation of crime against him is recognized as "fake news," saying that people want to increase their own knowledge of his name.
His lawyers are ready to proceed against the German news magazine Dr. Spegel, who made the complaint publicly.
In 2009, against the Portuguese and Juventus Ford, a hotel house called Catherine Mayorga in Las Vegas was accused of violating an American woman named Catherine Mayorga.
He was accused of giving him $375,000 to remain quiet about the incident, born in the Spegel report on Friday.
A few hours later, Ronaldo, 33-year-old, commented on the reporter as "mith news" when he talked to his 142 million florians in his Instagram live video.
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is a false news," the five-year balloon-d'or winner said in the camera.
"With my name, they want to grow their own knowledge.
It's a common thing.
My name is that they want to be famous, but it's a lifestyle.
"I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player said in a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to proceed against Dr. Spigel on the charges, which they claim to be "unworthy reports to be accepted as suspects in the case of privacy."
Lawyers Christian Sherts said the players should ask for the infringement "one of the serious infringements of personal rights, which may be one of the most recent infringements for the importance of the offence."
The incident was mentioned in a series of hotels and casinos in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to a paper filed in the Nevada Clark County District Court, he goes to the home of Ronaldo and Mayoraga players after meeting a nightclub, where he was tragicly violated.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo purchased his claim and told him that he was disappointed for "99 percent" "successful people," "one percent".
The document has been claimed that Ronaldo has confirmed that they have sexual relations, but it has been consensual.
Mayorga further claimed that he had gone to police and had taken a picture of her injury in the hospital, but later he was deported outside of the court, because he was "experiencing fear of paying" and fear of being "unrespected in public."
The 34-year-old said that he now wants to rebuild this mess, because he has been mentally opposed because of the incident.
During that crime, Ronaldo Manchester United was amongst adding Real Madrid to the United and joined the Italian famous club Juve for $100 million this summer.
Brexit: Losing position as a car manufacturer will "inspire the middle of the year"
Commerce Minister Greg Clarke said the UK would "will be the first to lose its position in the world in creating cars after Brexit."
He added that it was "disgusting" that the British Toyota told the BBC that if they left the UK without any agreement, they would temporarily stop their production at the factory in Bernstein to Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clarke said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, if Brexit is uncontracted, people can go to work because of the limited delays of the population.
The factory produced by Toyota Aris and Venice has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, which has been shipped to 90 percent of the rest of the European Union.
"I think that if the UK comes out of the U.S. at the end of March, production can be stopped in our factory," said Mr. Marvin Cock, director of Toyota Management in Burnstown.
Honda, B.M.D.W. and the other car manufacturers of the U.K. have expressed concern about how the European Union will be dismissed without any agreement.
For example, BM WW said they would close their mini-planet in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concern that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chain in terms of no contract Brexit.
The Toyota Production Line is based on the "Jast-in-Time" and the U.K. and E.U. both come from suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the U.S. without any agreement on March 29, it may occur at the border, which can cause the delays of the share of the government and the crisis of the share of the trade.
The company said that it is not possible to hold a price investment in the Toyota Derbishair Plant more than a day, because production can be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa Meer's plan for future relations with E.U. has been "adequately implemented to avoid this kind of check."
"We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only hold success, but it will also be possible to enjoy the possibility of future improvements," he said at today's BBC Radio 4.
"Cable Toyota isn't, but other manufacturers are also telling proof that keeping the supply chain's successful system is extremely important."
It is unable to say how long Toyota's production will be closed, but they have said it will reduce the competitiveness of the factory in the long term and will result in a lot of work.
For 24 years at Bernstein and the platform's Unity Union, Fan Peter Suvalaris, said his members are increasingly worried: "They won't come back once they've been doing these things in my experience.
"We have to maintain a specific and reliable plan for the future relationship with the EU," a spokesman said.
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed
When the Supreme Court took Namini Bret Kavanff's reports, Donald Trump and Deputy took a high-level meeting with General Rode Rosestein. The White House said it could be given "a further week later" on Sunday.
Rosstein, an investigator on Russia's interference, Trump's co-workers and Russian interconnection and the potential barriers to the president's trial, issued with the work of the Special Advisor Robert Müller.
Trump's deputy will be able to defeat General Turner and to address Mueller's independence question in Washington over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosstein had discussed the possibility of removing the President through secret Mike's use and 25 amendments to record conversations with Trump.
Rosestein has rejected the report.
However, he went to the White House on Tuesday in a report on such a report.
Instead, Trump was announced to the meeting on Thursday, while Trump was in the United Nations department at the time.
Trump said he wouldn't like to blame Rosstein, but one of the women who accused Kavanaf and her of sexual immorality, Dr. Christin Blagi Ford, both witnessed in the House of Representatives, the Senate Judicial Committee.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week to complain against Kavanaf, for which the full Senate votes have been more delayed.
Trump's press secretary, Serra Sanders, was released on Sunday in the fax news.
He said: "No date is correct, it may be this week, the other Supreme Court may be back for all the current matters another week.
Let's see you and I always want to tell the news."
Some journalists will oppose this statement. Sanders no longer browsed any press at the White House after September 10.
Criss Wallace asked her why.
Sandrs said that the reason for not having a briefing is not for disturbance to the journalists, although he said, "I don't refuse what they've done."
He then advised to increase direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The current president is meeting more questions than any previous president," he said without any evidence: "We have judged the number."
"It's better to talk to the U.S. President in the future than to talk to me if the news media has the opportunity to ask the U.S. President directly," Sanders said.
We've been trying to do this very much and you've seen it for us in the past few weeks, and you've been talking directly to the US President instead of press release."
Trump regularly accepts questions when taking part in the press conferences at most times or at opening sessions from the White House or with some other attendees.
A single press conference is very small.
New York has seen why it may be possible to work unexpectedly this week and occasionally present an impressive presence in front of the journalists.
Health Minister N.H.S. writes a letter to the fears of Brexit of U.S. employees in Scotland
The Scottish health minister has expressed his gratitude to the European Union's employees and expressed his wish to stay in the next Brexit.
Gene Freeman sent a letter that came out of the U.K.E. for less than six months ago.
The Scottish government has already promised to make the cost of set-up status applications for the U.S. citizens to work on government services in the country.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "The U.S. and the EU have continued discussions about Brexit throughout the summer, which are expected to be made in this regard.
But the UK is also preparing for potential uncontracted situations.
I know that you're all going through an alarming time for it.
That's why I'd like to remind you of the value of their contributions to me apart from the nationality of each member.
Workers from all over the European Union and outside of it have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved the healthcare service and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Crimea's emergency army after the death of the Christian
Tennessee's Mike Morgan reported that Tennessee's State Tiger's line-byer Christian Abrbury was forced to strike after the 31-27-year-old defeated match at Winderblt Commodore on Saturday.
Tennessee's headquarters Coach Red Red report that the injury was a few years ago.
Reid said, "They're going to the sideline, and they're going to be very busy."
The coach and the medical staff had given oxygen to the sideline, and later brought him back to testing.
An employee of Tennessee State, Tennessee Nashville, told Chris Harris of W.S.M.V. that he was outside of the Warwick Medical Center.
Harris further said that "there is no description of the type/type of the injury yet," and Tennessee is trying to know when the state injury was injured.

Jack Ross: “My dream is to take Scotland’s responsibility”
Sandraland's boss Jack Ross said his "final expectation" was to become Scotland's manager one day in the future.
These 42-year-old Scotland residents, currently enjoying the challenge of restoration of the North-East club, who are now in the third place in the League Waan, from the first to three points behind the team.
He returned to the Scottish Premiership last season to St. Mary's in the summer.
"I wanted to play as a player in the country.
I've got a B cap and so far, Ross BBC told Scottish Sports Sound.
"When I was a kid, I grew up seeing Scottish play in Campbell with my dad, and it always takes me back.
If I succeed in managing the club, this can only be a chance."
Among the predecessors of Ross as Sandraland managers, there are Dick Advocat, David Maes, Sam Alders, Martin O'Neill, why Ruth, Gus Poet, and Poolo D'Cany.
The former Aloia Athletic boss said he was not disappointed by rejecting the offer of the founding names of a large club such as Burnsley and Episcopy Town.
"It's going to be a success for me at this moment, 'Can I bring this club back to Premier League?'
"Due to the structure and benefits of this club, it is undoubtedly worthy of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not so easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success if I can bring the club back there."
As a co-owner boss and coaching staff in Dumberton, Ros's age is currently only three years after 15 months of staying as a coaching staff in Dumberton.
He then helped regain the light from the third level and convert the championship Shiropa to the championship from the next season of St. Mirane to the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable here than Clyde, Hartold, Falkhark, St. Miran and Hamilton Academy Awards.
He remembered taking the responsibility of the lighter, saying, "This was probably a real mailstone."
"I really believed that the manager is suitable for me than the game.
It's weird to hear it because I've done the right thing, I've been looking for a lifetime and I've enjoyed some success.
But it's hard to play.
You have to go into a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same in terms of work pressure, because the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage it and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing for my own skin in my adult life."

The survey says it's the best for pints on Saturday afternoon 5.30.
The summer temperature has increased in the British smoking paves, but the restaurants have caused pressure on the chain.
In July, the sales of pabbas and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but the money collection of restaurants has decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the company's business advisor, who has compiled these statistics, said: "When the unexpected long-term participation of the UK in Rhodes and the World Cup has grown. The volume of BDP is the same volume in BDP as the last month of July.
In June, 1.8 per cent of the business decline was worse.
Beverages and bars have been very good so far and the sales of restaurants have been so bad.
The main food paves are also enjoying hot cuffs, but they haven't been named below, like restaurants.
It seems that people are just going out for a little drink.
All the sales of beef and barbecue increased by 6.6 per cent this month, with food sales decreased by three per cent."
Pol Newman, the Absor and Attatha Analyst of S.M., said: "The trend of the end of April is still continuing.
The weather and large-scale social or sporting events have the most impact on the market outside of the house.
It is not surprising that restaurants groups will remain in difficult situations, but this decrease of 4.8 per cent on sales annually will be particularly unfair.
The main food operators can not come in a bad time from the long and warm summer and will tell if the soft weather in August will bring a bit of harshness."

Internet is doubled in breast pump advertising compared to mother and pigs
A breast pump company shared the views of the Internet with an advertisement to compare children's mothers to milk-eat pigs.
It is called "the world's first soundless-free breast pump," the consumer technology company Ilvi released a funny musical video advertising type to show the new pump that gives freedom to modern mothers.
The four real mothers danced with a song running a pig full of cows, with Lily, "Yes, I am my own milk gracious, but I don't have a lace" and "If no one sees, these are no animals, these are my breasts."
Corash continues to say, "Repeat the pump, repeat the pump, I eat the children, repeat the pump, I am the blessing of my friends' milk."
However, the advertising, which has been released on the Facebook page of the company, has made an online debate.
77,000 views and comments have received mixed reactions from video viewers. Many say it illuminates the "utility" of the milk industry.
"The use of this product in advertising is extremely bad decision.
They need to be pregnant as we do to make milk, and give birth to children, the difference is that within a few days of birth their children are stolen from them."
Lv breast pump is beautifully placed inside any nursing bras (Lv/Mom)
Another commented: "It's anxiety for both mothers and children.
But why shouldn't they be used in the advertising of the breast pump for the purpose of keeping the children in custody?"
Another said, "The ads are extremely distorted."
Others stand next to the advertising, a woman admits that the song likes her "inconvenient."
"I think it's a good idea.
If I'd eat milk, I'd like to eat a milk.
It seems to me that it's really cool when it's pumping.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I've done it well.
It's an inventive product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a remarkable advertising that she builds for mothers (often at their workplace or toilet) and considers themselves as a "good."
This advertising does not bring any praise or criticism to the Darian industry."
At the end of the video, a single woman said that they all danced with the hiding pump on their knees.
Advertising is based on this concept that many women feel like breast pumping.
Although the LVI pump is completely soundless, it does not have its or the tube and is beautifully fitted into the nursing bra, which also provides women with freedom to walk, hold the baby ball, and even out.
Ana Ballerina, Mother's partner and E.C.D., said: "LOV pump is a popular product that should start boldly and excitingly.
We wanted to capture the breast pumping and all of its challenges on a spotlight, revealing a new pump in a fun and related way that brings an incredible sense of liberation.
This time, the Lv pump didn't take the first place in the news.
In the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children used this product and walked to Kattawa for the designer Martha Jacubosque.
Several immigrants have been taken to a tent of silence in Texas borders
The number of detained immigrants has risen, although monthly borders are comparatively unchanged, because the rigorous rules and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to hold children to their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are afraid to lose their chances of staying in the country without papers and claiming to immigrants and children.
This risk increases in June, when the Federal authorities declare that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family will have to collect fingerprints, and the information will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, a pronounced official for immigration and immigration application, Matthew Albance Congress, testified that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor Anatha children.
According to the agency, 70 percent of those who are arrested have no crime history in the past.
"About 80 percent of the sponsor or sponsor family members are illegally in the country and a large part of them are criminals.
"We're going to look for them," Nister Albans said.
In an effort to return children to a faster society, employees have introduced some new rules that have to be filed in court within a month, which was 60 days before, asylum seekers said.
Many of the immigration judges will not be attended by video conferences during their case for legal martyrs.
Those who are regarded as unworthy of salvation will be promptly expelled.
According to refugee personnel and reports published by the system in recent months, the more anxiety or disappointment are likely to be held during the period of seven days, resulting in angry events or prevention of escape.
The supporters say that these concerns are stronger in large centers such as Tornillo, where children are more likely to be worried, more likely to be seen, because of their size.
They also say that if children are not mentally prepared or are not taken away from the center with enough time to say goodbye to friends, many can grow these trams in a few corners so that they are already hungry.
The U.S., the French and the Turkish "deployed army" will immediately leave Syria
According to the UN General Advisor, Foreign Minister Walid-Al-Mohalam has called for Syrian refugees to return to the country, although Tanna has been warning for eight years.
Mohammed, who is with the country's deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are in the country's land in the fight against terrorism, and "we will take appropriate arrangements."
"They're going to go without any conditions," he said.
Mohammed said the Syrian war against terrorism has almost ended, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and millions of people have been forced to escape from their homes.
Damascus said that the war will be launched until the entire Syrian earthquake is cleared, against both terrorists and "unlawful foreign presence."
There are nearly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, for training and advice to both the Kurdish Army and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are more than 1,000 members of the French army in the armed country.
In the question of refugees, Muhammed said that the situation is beneficial for their return and that he is responsible for "suppressing some Western country" "unsafe fear," which has led refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and human organizations to assist in this resignation," he said.
"They're in politics about the entire human problem."
The U.S. and the European Union have stated that Syria will not be aid in any restructuring until the political agreement has been concluded in order to end the war between Assad and the opponents.
The U.N. politicians said that Idlib's last major deployed wheel had given the opportunity to move forward through the recent political negotiations between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large type of attacks by the Russian-Turkish army supported in the region, where three million people live.
However, Mohammed insisted that the deal has a "precise time limit" and he has revealed that the military action of Al-Qaeda-related Nuss will work against the fighters of the Front Jedi, who will be "defeated."
The United Nations President Stephan D, Members of the United Nations, will soon prepare the war-to-representation of the Constitution and make it possible for government and opposition members to call for the first meeting of a new committee.
Mohammed expressed the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "in the field of review of the provisions of the current constitution," and he warned against unregulated interventions.

Politicians have pointed out that Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beinging, leaving Washington slightly behind.

The next uncertainty may occur in the legality of Mr. Trump's special report on the potential obstacle to Mr. Robert Muller, which now contains sufficient evidence in the public record.
During the elections, Mr. Trump had been struggling with Russia whether Mr. Muller's investigation was going to be defeated.

Russia's Grand Prix: Louis Hamillton has gone closer to the world's gambling to win the donation of the confessionary service vetel
It was clear at the time when Walter Butts gained qualifications before Louis Hamilton on Saturday and said the Marxized team's order would play an important role in this race.
The buttons started well from the Pole, nearly reaching Hamilton to hold the first two left-handed positions and invited Vetel to attack his own team players.
He's going to get the house behind the crowd, and he's going to get the house behind the crowd.
This Mercedes driver hits the lap and comes behind the vetel, but goes forward after Hamilton's tension fight, so that this return driver can be seen in a double-mounted manner. Risk to unpreparedly handle the opportunity.
Max Warspeen started on his 21st birthday and was at the number seven after the first lap.
Then he stayed in the first part of the race, and then picked up the fourth place behind Kim Riikoneon with the bad tyre.
He hit the 44th lap, but the rest of the lap couldn't increase the speed, resulting in Riyconne's staying in fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valerie has grown beautiful all weekends and worked like a real fan.
"The team is doing a good job to take the first place," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
The Supreme Court's accusation of sexual imprisonment against Namini Bret Kavanff did not address the letter by Christine Blaige Ford on President Donald Trump on a meeting on Saturday.
In a meeting of Western Virginia, the president did not talk directly about the subject, but he said that what is going on in the cinema is manifesting human "low and low and false" mentality.
"This is a thing that could be happening and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the past few weeks, you'll be angry when you see a low and witch and liar people," he said.
"When they're going to see the information, they say, 'Yes, I didn't.'
Oh, I didn't."
Do you remember?
Diane Finestine, do you find it?
Remember the answer, "You've got a file," "Oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't find it."
Wait, stop for a minute.
"We haven't, we haven't," he said, calling the Senate.
The letter was sent to Ford Finestin with a description of the complaints against Kafanf in July, and the letter was filed in September - but Finestin refused to file the letter from his office.
"I haven't locked Dr. Ford's complaints, I haven't found anything," the Finnstein Committee said.
"He told me to keep it secret and I kept it secret according to him."
But he wasn't talking about the president, he opened his mouth on Saturday night's meeting: "I tell you what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the worse language than that."
Speaking to the Supreme Court of the three women accused of sexual injury, the president said the doctors are using the accusations for their own purpose.
"They want to get power back at any price.
"Look at low mentality, look at talent, don't hesitate to injure anyone, don't hesitate to impose anyone to get power and control," the president said in a statement.

Aerial accident in Micronesia: Leguon's airplane crash is reported to have been investigated by an airplane crash
When an airline flew into the Pacific Pacific Legion, they had previously reported that 47 passengers and employees were all rescued from the airplane. Now they are reporting that there is a nickname.
Air Niguini said on Saturday afternoon that a man couldn't find a passenger.
The airline said they were working with local administrations, hospitals and researchers to get their search.
Airline immediately refused to report detailed information such as the passenger's business and nationality.
The airplane helps local ships to rescue passengers and employees after falling into the water during the attempt of the ship at Iceland airport.
The police said seven people were taken to the hospital on Friday.
The airline reported that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and they are all in a stable situation.
The reason for the accident is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have said that the airplane is down water before it arrives in Rhanoi.
A number of confirmations seemed to have been transferred to Rhanoi.
U.S. passenger Bill Jens said the plane had been down.
"It's a good thing," Jane said.
Jens said he and the other people were at the doors of the airplane during the time of the airplane.
He said the airline was shouting out of fear and a little bit on his head.

Analysts have been able to repeat the lifetime of the woman's burning
In 2014, a woman in Mississippi resumed a prosecution case on Saturday in the prosecution case of the accused indicted by a deadly burn.
U.S. Court Analyst Paul Roleth Goedanda has testified for several hours as an expert in analysis.
He explained to Jury how 29-year-old Asmae Quinn Teless and 19-year-old hunter Jessica Chambers made the incident of his death at night.
Raolet said he saved several cell phone data from which it is clear that the death evening was together with Teles and Chambers, which was against the former deputy of Teles, Clarion Laser.
It is reported that at the time she was with her phone phone, although she denied she was with her friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford told him that he wasn't in the city on Saturday night.
When the coach asks whether Teles is telling the truth that he was on the Sanford truck that night, Sanford replies, "That's a misconception because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another disadvantage is that Teles said she knew him two weeks before the Chamber's death.
The telephone record says they've known each other for just a week.
According to Roleyt, after some of the chamber's death, Teles is deleting the text, call and contact information from their phones.
"He's going to get him out of his life," said Haley.
The last statement of the case was held on Sunday.
The judge said the case would be expected to go to Juri the next day.

New York Nani has accused a pair of working after the "Black-International" text.
A Nani in New York is appealing against the related couple whose mother has received a confusing text for a diverse escape, so that he is accused of being called the "eighteen turmoil."
The couple rejected the accusations of becoming a globalist and appealed to the accusation of "Zulum".
The mother of two children, Lincy Plusco-Flaxman, was disappointed after the first day of the work in 2016, to know that Gizel Morris, the new child's viewer, was a desperate.
"Another Crusher," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, he sent it to his husband instead of sending it to Mrs. Mariss twice.
Later, when he realized his mistake, "Inconvenient" exclaimed Ms. Chris. He said that their former Nani, who was African-American, was hoping for a philippine to do wrong, report of the New York Post.
Mrs. Mariss was sent to the house on a day and then sent to Uber's house.
Maris is now injured for damages in the incident against the couple and requests $350 per day for six months, although he was first kidnapped as a nany to stay at home without any agreement.
"I want to show them, look, this can't be done," he told the post on Friday, and added, "I know it's different."
The couple said they were opposed to claiming that the reasonable work to accuse Maris was fearing that it could not be believed on him after he was accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being accused of being.
"My wife didn't want to say what she sent.
He isn't a Barnaby.
"We are not a parliamentary couple," Joel Plasco said.
"But do you get your children out of the hand with whom you used badly, although you did wrong?"
Your child's birthday?
Tell me."
Plasco said his wife had born a child only two months ago and was in a ‘good difficult situation’.
"Do you want to go against someone like that?"
"It's not a good thing to do," the bank said.
The Court of Public Prosecution in the Social Media has been prosecuted against this pair's behaviour and against justice.
Paddington's publisher is concerned that readers may not be able to relate themselves to the message they can speak.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was home, said about the letter: "It's hard to say what her mind will be for the first time before her release.
It's funny to know that after the great success of Paddington.
His father, who worked as BBC's cameraman before he received the inspiration to write the children's book from the small toy window, said he was hoping to reject his work. He also said that he was married to him. "He was 60 years old after his death last year."
With regard to Paddington, which he described as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a silent man, and he wasn't a delicate man," he said.
"When Paddington was so real to him that your child has achieved a success: you're proud of him, although you don't have any role in it.
I think that's how he looked at the success of Paddington.
Although it was the fruit of his own creation and imagination, he always thanked Paddington himself.
My girlfriend was on the way to the dead and I was going to say goodbye to her.
After the birth, his daughter was taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasturus 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nadd regularly called that it's very bad, and he doesn't feel like it's going to be alive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperrose said.
"Then I got Nade's phone and I could know he'd die in two minutes, and I was forced to say goodbye to him.
And I do that.
I said, "I love you very much, Darling.
I'll come to you very soon.
I'll come to you.
The doctors slowly stopped working on her body to keep her heartbeat off.
He died a few days ago and then everything was closed.
I didn't have any way to wait for me, all know.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in my family and in my family.
I had to keep myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, when her voice exclaimed sorrow on the death of her son, grew up on the plane as well as other passengers - she was an other person for this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
“I was down my head, I was constantly watering out of my eyes.
It's not possible to explain it, but I was in the same manner as Nad's in the airplane.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how well he was based on it.
The woman posted a card on the bridge for suicide.
Two women who have lost their loved one's suicide work to stop the other's suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted inspiring message cards at the Wells Bridge and placed a phone number where people can call for support.
Mr. Davis's son, Taylor, died in depression from 13 years of age and 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm representing," he said.
The 45-year-old Miz Davis, who lives in Lydia, said his son was a promising chief and had an infectious laughter.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They all said that the house was shining in his smile."
In any case, he left the work before his death, because he "was gone into the dark."
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 years old, was found dead.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that I'm going to leave this effort."
Mr. Davis's card says, "To tell everyone that there is a person you can talk to, he may be a friend too.
Don't sit quietly - you don't need to talk.
Miz Hamfris, who has been a friend of Miz Davis for many years, has lost her 15-year-old companion Mark after his mother's death.
"He has never said his mind is bad or he's disturbed or something else," he said.
"I've made some changes in the use of it two days ago.
"Christmas' day was a very bad condition - when the children open their gifts, he didn't look at them."
He said that his death had a huge mental injury to them, but it had to be cut off: "This family had created a huge shadow.
We've been pushing out.
But we have to go and fight."

B.B.I.'s investigation into the future of Bret Kavanaf
"I thought, if we could give him what he wanted - because the time of the investigation is limited, the chances are limited - we could probably bring some of the chances," Mr. Fleck said Saturday. He said in the same way he was scared.
Why did Mr. Kavanaf and his Republicans not want to investigate the FBI?
They are related to the time of their obligation.
On November 6, only five weeks - if, according to expectations, the Republicans make bad results, however, their efforts to get people who prefer the country's highest court will become very weak.
George Dw. is calling for Senators and urging them to support Mr. Kavanf, working under Mr. Bush, the White House. Through him Mr. Bush was familiar with his wife Assal, who is Mr. Bush's personal person.
What's going on after the FB report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanff can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which can ensure him in the Supreme Court if Vice-President Mike Pence breaks Ty.
"The number of North Korean teams under Kimi"
Seven years ago, the number of North Korean teams dropped after Kim Jong-un came into power, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Being-Seg, South Korea's Ministry of Reunification, reported that last year the number of teams was 1,127 - which was 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main reason for severe border controls between North Korea and China and deprivation of human trafficking.
Pyongyang hasn't made any public comments on this.
A large number of South Koreans from North Korea have been given citizenship.
According to Saul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them have fled to China, with the longest borders with North Korea, and it's easier to become an extremely secure unparalleled zone (DM ZJ) in both Korea.
China is not counted as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often forced them to return to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still in war - have been significantly improved in recent months.
In the beginning of the month, the two leaders met for a discussion in Beijing, which was at the center of the topic of nuclear weapons.
It was after the historical meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they were fully agreed to work for the purpose of creating nuclear-weapon-free Korean coastline.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Rei Yong-Ho accused the U.S. of banning the progress on Saturday.
In a speech to the United Nations General Council, Mr. Rei said: "Unless there is no trust in the United States, we will have no trust in our national protection and we will never simultaneously kill ourselves in such a situation."
Nancy Pelocy Brett Kavanf said "Histria-Gast" to Nancy. He said he was unworthy to perform the responsibilities at the Supreme Court.
The House's minority leader Nancy Pelosi, the Supreme Court, Namini Bret Kavanof, has awarded "Histria-Gast" and said that he is likely to be in line with the Supreme Court's responsibilities.
Pelocy commented at an interview at the Texas Tribun Festival on Saturday in Austin, Texas.
Pelocy said on Thursday about her response to the witness of Kafanf in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, "I couldn't think that if any woman ever had such a job, she would be called "Historia-Great."
He refused to accuse Kavanaf of having sex with Dr. Christian Blagi when both of them were young.
During his initial declaration, Kavanf was excited to talk about his family and high school life, and he stopped breathing.
He clearly accused the Democrats in the committee and accused the allegations against him with an acclaim held by the liberals to be a "fuck and corporate character" that Hillary Clinton is making it in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelocy said he believes the evidence of Kavanav proves that he is not eligible for the Supreme Court, because it has been proven that he is counterfeited against the Democrats.
"I think he has proven himself unworthy of the statements he has made and how Clinton and Democrates have rejected," he said.
When asked if Kafan is sure and if the doctors get a majority in the house, he will curse him, Pelocy reveals a little.
"I'm going to say that -- if he doesn't say the truth to Congress or FB I, then he doesn't just deserve the Supreme Court, but he's also worth it in the court right now," Pelocy said.
Kavanaf is currently the judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelocy added that as a demokrat, he is worried that he will oppose the Kafanf Waterfall Kear Act or Ro V. Wade, because he himself is a Concert Jastis.
In his affirmation, Kafanf has avoided the question whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be done that the Histrian-Great person, who is injured, goes to the court to tell us, 'Isn't that great,' Pelocy said.
Women should control it.
It is a fair dispute, month and year after year, and he can't cry.
"We're angry," Mr. Steenem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you say?"
He also said, "I have helped a woman who was a leader who said she was angry as well as crying. But when she chose this approach that she started crying when she went angry, she said to her with whom she spoke, "I felt sorry for you, for I was crying.
I'm really angry."
Then he went on.
I thought it was great."
The ears are partly working as an outbreak of anger, because they are predominantly the hunters of misunderstanding.
A worker on the first hand was my strong memory, in a man-chef office, where I once saw myself crying with an incredible anger, a older woman took my scroll - who was a terrible manager - I always took her in a little bit of fear - who frightened me.
"Don't see them crying," he said.
"They don't know you're crucified.
They think you're sad, and you'll be happy to see them."
Patrick Audier, then-called Democratic Congressman, worked with him during Gary Heart's president's elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Heart was caught in a vessel named Manky Business overseas about marriage, and left the competition for naked work, Mr. Miz Schloder was deeply disappointed that he had no reason to be a candidate for his own president.
"It wasn't a good decision," he laughed 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the fight, and no one else wanted.
One of them said, "White and white."
When the campaign was delayed, he was back on the collection of Tehbyl and so he was unwilling to take $2 million off the run.
It was the war of loss.
He realized that if a supporter gave a man $1,000, he was only given $250.
"Do you think I'm going to get the price?" he was surprised.
When he declares that he does not conduct an official campaign, he will feel very appreciated and be grateful to his supporters, making money harder to collect, and he will be disappointed with the system, causing the loss of the representatives.
"You might think that I've been snowy," Mr. S. S. said in a statement.
"You might think Clinix is my corporate sponsor.
I thought, "Where are they going to bury me?"
"He's crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Go to Beijing
The U.S.-China trade war was the first mountain of the trade war, and when the war ended, the two countries could benefit in the long run, like experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump has first warned about expanding solar panels, steel and aluminum main Chinese refined products to the beginning of this year.
The most important answer has been this week, when nearly half of the total imports from China, the amount of about $200 billion (150 billion pounds), new sales are put in place.
Beijing has received back payments, just recently, they have increased $60 billion from five to ten percent over the U.S. product.
China has taken a fighting decision in the eyes of the world, and there is no possibility that the world's second-largest economy will soon take a look at it.
The demand for Washington's defeat, however, would be extremely negligent for China's President Shi Jinping, which has been put to death to the U.S. publicly.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play the tass correctly, the pressure of the U.S. trade war can reduce the interference between the two economies in the long term help China positively.
"As a result of any quick political decision in Washington or Beigin, it can create a situation that begins economic defeat in both countries, which is much more dangerous than the concept of Whiskyhall, which is more dangerous than the assumption of Warwick."
Syria is "prepared" to return its rebels, the foreign minister said.
Syria said the country was ready to return to the volunteers, and the country had been rebuilt for seven years.
In the United Nations General Council, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mohalam said the situation is improving.
"The situation is stable and secure because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to restore the normal situation to the regions destroyed by terrorists.
All situations are now suitable for people who are forced to leave the country to return to the country because of the daily life and the use of their daily lives due to terrorism and the poorer economic situation.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian countries have fled since the war began in 2011.
More than 6 million people from the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muhalam said the Syrian government welcomed all the support of the country's recovery.
However, he strongly said that no aid would be accepted under any conditions or that the aid of the disturbances would be taken from the country.
The winner of the Paris Rider Cup
The team lost the U.S.A. in 2018 with the help of the final score of 16.5-10.5 out of golf outside Paris in France.
The U.S. has won six times in the land of Europe, and since 1993 they haven't won any other rider cup.
The team, led by Denmark's President Toms Bayons, has reached and restored Shiropa to 14.5 points necessary to win Europe to the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michaelson, who couldn't play well in most of the tournament, died in the water when he scored 16 times, and lost his T-shot at Francesco Molinoir.
Italy's golfer Molinary has been one of only one of the top 4 scored in 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979, showing full performance in all rounds.
The American Jordan Spith, the European team's lowest ranking player, was held at the 5th and 4th tournament of the World Cup in Denmark.
The world's top-season player, Justin Johnson, lost to England's Ian Polter, who possibly played his last rider cup.
An experienced eight-time rider Cup, Spain Sergio Garcia became the largest owner of all-time victory in Europe with a 25,5 career point.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't do it this time.
The year has been very bad.
Thanks to Thomas for the election and trusting me.
I'm very happy, I got the cup back.
"It's the team's success, I'm happy that I've been able to help," the European leader said.
He took his country's role in John Ram, who lost the U.S. legendary tiger Woods in Singles on Sunday 2 and 1.
"I'm very proud to have lost Tiger Woods, and I've grown up," said 23-year-old John Ham.
Woods lost his four matches in France, and standing in the rider's record 13-21-3.
For one of the best players of all time, it's Baman's statistics, which has won 14 major games after Jack Nicholas's only top.
The high-quality performance displayer Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau's team have been playing chess throughout the week.
U.S. Secretary Jim Furrick, after his disappointing performance, said, "I am proud of them, they have fought.
We've been pushing a bit of pressure on Europe this morning.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good master.
All of his 12 players have played very well.
"We'll be standing around, I'll work with the U.S. P.G. and the Rider Cup Committee and go forward.
I love these 12 people and I am proud to be their master.
You need to tell them about it.
We didn't get to the game."
Red Sroth Lightning: The density of Penelas, Quality and Sarasota has decreased
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's first new report has seen a general decline in the density of red water in the coastal region.
According to F.W.C., the pandemic has occurred in the region of Panelas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Coria County - which is a sign of density decrease.
Bloom in Red Srot is extended about 130 miles from the north of Pennsylvania to the south of Li County.
