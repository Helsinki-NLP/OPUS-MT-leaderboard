Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A place where youths are to meet today.
A groove capsule, where it is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners manage the instigation of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories every day.
It's upset if the maps are not current.
It is known to everyone who once had to be excited because the auto-navi, rather than a convergence road, showed a green trail.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlantis, an offer of the Bavarian government’s geoportal, are all other than current - but that’s why it is very important.
Especially when comparing them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the Munich distribution area since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlantis is a flat roof that is not recognized as such.
The large overview map has been incorporated more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called origin sheets.
These occurred, according to the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864, and originated from the first measurement of Bavarians.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic inclusion of Bavarians - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801: they were the current neighbours who created the idea of a broadening Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph advanced the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerical Measurement Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich originates in 1856 and is found on the website of the Bavarian national library.
The comparison earlier/today is most impressive in the example of the country’s capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is subsendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877 as Munich district.
Today, subsendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of subsendlings concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: at the hills there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten lines from the so-called "reception", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer located there by farmers today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sunne".
A large green area distinguishes itself north of the subsidiary.
The Theresienwiese, the stage of the October Festival since 1810, was in fact still a wire - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the area of today’s district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street names "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people with dishonest imaginations were once shut down.
In 1858/59 the Munich Circus-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Vents" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the survey of the so-called Irene.
In addition, he has banned the staff from applying violence against the prisoners,” says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the office.
For 280 patients, it was first space, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient – the reason for the construction of the circular institution in the hair in 1905.
There, since 2006, the Isar-Amper clinic is located in Munich-East, one of Germany’s largest psychiatrists.
At the area of the former Auer Anstalt, youths are now met in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth house with training facilities.
West is the TSV Munich East, eastern houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural direction to the original building of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II with bombing attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as "Haupt Place", the Kaufingerstraße called "Kaufinger Street".
A decisive change led to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allied bombs dropped many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marien Cemetery.
The English Institute, small business houses and a grove capsule from the Middle Ages were once standing at the Marienhof, where these days the preworks and the Spatenstich took place on 5 April 2017 for the second S-Bahn Stamway.
The ski controller can compare the old Munich map with the air image of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racial attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is intended to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travelling through the state and to give extreme caution, as a series of questionable, racial-based incidents will be held in the last time," the group says.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination complaints, as well as law enforcement authorities in the state, who are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“You have violations of civil rights that people are going through.
They are arrested because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed,” said Missouri’s president, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.”
This is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a 28-year-old, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he no longer had gasoline during his trip through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The Council also pointed out a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor General of Missouri, showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more frequently arrested than white.
“The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People must be willing to bring deposit money or let their relatives know they are traveling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate reporting program, which ranked the state in terms of the number of such injuries in the country's 16th rank.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company of housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel alerts for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fisherbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.
Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac, CDU's allies, have taken an image on-site.
At the Court of Justice of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU Local Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals supplied and hosts in five apartments.
The "black milk" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, he said.
At the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the Weidezaun project as "elementary important".
I can’t handle so steep areas profitably.
The ground floor ensures a lot of work, a lot must be processed with the motorsense.
“We have to fight with the conditions and topography here,” Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not carry out biological farming.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the Leader promotion."
At the expense of EUR 3,000 to EUR 4,000 per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that the exploration of the surfaces can be removed for a while.
“The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations,” the mayor said.
Farmers are often in criticism because of promoting
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were added to the support.
The opening area is 40 hectares, which cannot be lifted by at least 2023.
Of the total costs of €71,500, half was funded via Leader, a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of distance.
“The great advantage is the longevity of the bulbs,” Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac said, “You are doing a good job without farmers and ladies.”
Peter White also said, “The best food is produced here.”
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of Weidezen.
The goal is to open the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the presence of a funding flow referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the inundated area must not be handleable (about 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by exploring.
For the Fisherbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels that want to build nearly 16 kilometers of zaun.
The area of openness is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now, Trump’s White House takes the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime exchange is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other – so the careful scenery of Saddam Husseins on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom.
In order to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have shipped him if he had done it.
But he touched their importance, and particularly the importance that was assigned to her, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base.
Miller Acosta said: “I don’t want to take part in a whole thing about history, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is actually right, but as he formulated it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to Lazarus’ sad words, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your tiredness, your poor, your disturbed masses, who desire to breathe freely, the poorest waste of your rich coasts.”
There has never been a time when the "selling waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in Trump’s US.
This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.
Lazarus – and her friends who committed themselves to placing their words on the base after their death – knew very well that they had committed a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the feminist embracing of freedom in a useless classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for Trump’s coming, argued in 2010 that the Freedom Statue would invite no one but rather be an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the dissatisfied world: “Lady Liberty goes forward.
It is intended to wear the shadow of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fack should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Unusually, Limbaugh has hit something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the view of perception.
Lazarus’ great imaginative deed was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, poor but hopeful people to travel long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their sword shall not illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
Neil Black, the power director of the UK's body athletics, said that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "I'm developing something special in Scotland" and the UK's body athletics must learn something about it.
“We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we’ll continue until we find out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British body athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal supporters, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be struggling against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected to be the captain of the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their Captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh introduced naturally were great.”
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take place at its fifth world championship at the 400-m-hurds, says it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland’s best total number of athletes at the World Cup were seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-road driver Muir has launched this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 meters, is another schotch that should be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championship when she was the only other Scott in the team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says they are “enormous” proud of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases will also be mixed with the medals and the finals.
“The particular thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other team members, so it was a great honour, but knowing that my team colleagues have voted for me and chosen me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scottish team members.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to ride on podiums.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t call for a public office if you can’t tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from internal policy to his political principles.
He sneaked in criticism, of course.
But he didn’t make his critics quiet.
For in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor released the complaint as freevol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?" .
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is incredibly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hetzkopf.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and debuting his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, officially referred to as, and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the picture of trolls, spammers, or hateful people who blow the pest online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true men who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur and a pastor, no troll.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented sharply that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast "The Post".
“I don’t appreciate this idea, even if a number of people take position on the same subject, then they will be ignored by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor’s employees referred to as a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “threat language”.
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than before if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guide articles, to burn them up, or to arrest demonstrators, and to silence them.
But that’s what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for accusing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestone in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers came to his leadership.
Even then, Washington had an anonymous troll.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that lowered Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, commerce and maritime transport with the United Kingdom overcame his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't make them silent.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discussions are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope to be in-house comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organise the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led to the end end last year near the Archerfield Links before he lost against Paul Eales, has been linked to the new casting site and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his reputation with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a jealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course.”
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won his 32-year-old career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It really feels very special," said the player in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken from the program the year after I won it.
Returning to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home floors.
This event will be the first Scottish event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do it well, but you also feel that additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy how much it has gone."
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James, and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, others Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £5 per car with a seat and £10 per car with two or more seats.
All income goes to prostate cancer UK.
Less lung cancer by passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died from passive smoking from lung cancer.
Researchers from the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) study.
"We estimate that 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year," study manager Heiko Becher said.
As a comparison, he conducted his own study on this issue in 1994.
At that time, there were more than 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new survey was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full gage and "look somewhat in time," said the head of the building building Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as a lot is hidden in the underground, which is not noticed in the plans.
Traffic, which continues to hinder the construction work, is a major problem for the company’s construction team Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red amplifiers and shutdowns is already huge," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only the lines buses are entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were very hard.
But fortunately, we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water,” Marvin Kostorz says.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooked dinner, she doesn't use her flock.
It even rarely uses a toast.
In its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai province in the quiet Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the cabin.
After half an hour, the sold nose with eager, unwashed hands will be removed and scratched.
Dege sits on the leafboard - she does not have furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. wash clothes with tremendous water from the nearby soup.
An eagle in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As younger of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamia is common here.
Of course, late working can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
“No one is afraid to walk around in the village after 17:00,” she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was adopted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,066 elders should vote in front of the occupation forces by a public hand-help.
An existing movement that raised independence against the Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region, and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as far away as it is destined. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the province capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour car ride by car.
There is no public transportation.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo saunas, and of wave sheet roofs transformed by ross into different yellow-braun tones.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, but no journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Degei, pointing out on their lively, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and their bright clothes.
“We had only leaves on our bodies before.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28 percent of people live under the poverty limit and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
It is also Indonesian Goldland.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport has reduced $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources worth estimated $78 billion.
However, these treasures are a source of eagerness for the Papua, ensuring that the powerful military of Indonesia preserves an erotic presence.
A 2005 survey in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars to a single officer between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gands and are treated without mercy.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass expenses in Papuas Stammeshochland in the 1970s were made according to the Asian Human Rights Commission on Genocide.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We're going to Lose Everything," it says in a 2016 report by the Brisbane Archbishop, in which reports on crimes of the previous year, such as illegal punishments and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal rash of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua’s resources bring a flow of residents from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 percent Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning quantities sell brown chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable with soup of ground.
Local people are fighting for staying here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai-Einheimer who moved to the Jayapura province capital to work.
“It has cost the local Papua – the mother of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in the Peoplesmund as Jokowi, promised to deal with inequalities and infringements in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former Zimmerman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua – including Paniai – on the way to the President’s Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has little changed, and today the locals feel fraudulent.
“Our hearts have been broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, expecting him to meet our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai suffers a deep point only two months after Jokowi's invasion in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and singed Christmas songs before a gunfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke a motorcycle through darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on their shields.
One of the soldiers took his tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers, who had drunk, hunted and struck the group with their guns, told victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was fired and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting boxes and introduced the Waita dance - in the circle ongoing and imitating a bird song - from the Papuas Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began screwing stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses do more than three times resistance, they shoot them dead," it says in an official document of TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremia Kayame, 56-year-old, the leader of the Kego Koto holiday in Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned, I was suddenly shot in my left hand link," he said on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but says the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overwhelmed, many shots were fired," he added.
Indigenous man Alfius Youw was encountered three times, so his cousin, who was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was," said Johan, who, as many Indonesians, only bears a name, the TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers just wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many were injured.
The news about the murders came to Jakarta only on the following day.
In three weeks, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to deal with the historical failures in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he had established an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations.
But the statements began almost immediately.
“Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be passed,” he said.
Then Wiranto took a withdrawal when he talked to Time in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, accused by the United Nations of "crime against humanity", which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been reported, including the paniai incident.
Families of the victims of pania received such claims with cruel unbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still alive in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"When I had buried the bodies, the military sought me," he said.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot village residents in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he caught in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Injured villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by fired warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we were afraid that there would be revenge," said the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were quickly delivered here," the TIME said.
“I have hid myself for two days in my house.”
The Deiyai parliament has called upon the officers involved to take account and withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Paniai was always a disturbance for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the disagreement of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and deportation of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested under the pretext of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never look up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as far away.
People here build everything they eat: notes and fruit and leaves.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupee (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown in larger numbers since the opening of new airlines to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to better trained and more wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the skills necessary to lead their own companies competitively.
“Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain stressed.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s voting campaign promises to revoke the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia to the most quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: a visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread infringements" in Papua, including the paniai strike.
The same countries have historically seen supporting the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group’s accusations and told journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it’s difficult to suppress evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take this into account.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, attended by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and threatened him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the session but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a Hungarian military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a “debt” that he has to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he said.
Despite the threats and threats, the families of the victims of the paniai shots carried out a last symbolic act of the trout: the body of a victim was buried on a ground precisely in front of the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a shattered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'Torch' cloud crash for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the world’s highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that climbs through the high house in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch-Tower (Fackel-Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We’ve slept and we’ve risen in the fire alarm and in the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor,” said a resident named George, Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the firefighting units were deleted at 4 p.m. local time (0 p.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the coverage, outdoor coverage for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believed that the system of insulation and cloth plates at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through the General Assembly with his big Davis Cup Cup.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport, Davis Cup Angel, to play only two more winnings, was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although these five-set classics are often very long, but are also very appreciated for this reason, they remain in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely failed.
“We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the application.
It was not only before the vote, after many claims, that the proposal had already come to hold the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: so finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the right to host the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organizers, the requirements for training spaces, etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. passengers brings banned items into the plane, a survey finds
A survey of flight passengers found that more than 20 percent of consciously or unconsciously prohibited objects had passed through the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6% of those involved the aircraft while carrying accidentally prohibited knives or other objects with knives.
Less than 1% claimed that they had delayed to discover that they were wrongly traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were rather misleading the rules.
Of the surveyers who admitted they consciously tried to fly with something banned by the TSA were 19.7 percent millennials, compared to less than 15 percent members of the X-generation.
The most common items that were deliberately scattered to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent of the women’s surveys and 3.7 per cent of men’s surveys also confirmed that they had deliberately brought drugs to the plane.
The company said it has surveyed travellers across the country to find out how many accidental scams have brought through airport security and how many have deliberately done it.
It is no surprise that the people who wear the oldest scamware - consciously or unconsciously - through security were those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are slightly complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about what fluids they may take with them or how much of them.
It is therefore not surprising that the greatest quantity of the objects captured by the TSA are the liquids prohibited.
For a long time, people thought that the TSA could consider books as a scamware.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk enjoys delivering the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has assumed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unbinding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla’s head Elon Musk has given another, less brilliant number in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often thrown more than 500,000 pre-order orders for the new car, whose delivery has just begun.
Now Musk admits: from the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 euros (in the US $1,000 and in the UK £1,000) "reservation payment" completely.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are presented, Musk entered a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings per day.
Anyone who orders a Model 3 today can expect the delivery at least early in the second half of 2018 – if Tesla is able to drive its new nails, never tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum burden.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if it comes to greater delays, then the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Since then, the company cannot prevent unpleasant customers from running away in many.
EPA Chief Pruitt retreats due to the delay of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he was charged by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority, resigned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved the needs of state environmental authorities to react faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint which had been brought against his previous position in a federal profession court.
It is a deadline that expired on October 1 for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Pre-appointed by President Donald Trump, Prosecutor of Oklahoma for a long time, Pruitt was a reliable opponent of more strict environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations against which the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industry are opposed.
The sudden reverse from Wednesday is the latest legal refund for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule obliging oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In an opinion published Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that his return to ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of time-conforming new standards.
"In the past administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activists and other groups, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We do not believe in a regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and authority that we have.”
However, the EPA’s opinion said that Pruitt would once use its “delay powers and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on a solid policy and the best information available”.
The Republicans in Congress are demanding a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A legislative draft approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The action has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York’s Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had accused the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
“The reverse of the EPA – according to our complaints – is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by smog flowing into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
In sensitive groups of people, smog can cause serious breathing problems, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public healthcare and the environmentalist rejoiced over the surprising course change of Pruitts.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the air protection manager that we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crossing of Trump’s government to offer ourselves to environmental pollutants and their particular interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the jubilee the mountain church is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 16.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the Sixth Benefit Series can be surprised by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building on the site has made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen to their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique interfacial littleod."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Urkundenbook: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the pastoral church on it to Tumlingen as well as the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, except for the invasive priesthood, there was also a royal court, to which the Church or the Patronate Law belonged, and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As shown in the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the under village and the Oberdorf, which is still recognized today in the picture of the town of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the royal settlement of the village.
Old maps of the time around the year 1600 undermine these historical circumstances.
The Patronat Law was derived from the early medieval church ownership law.
A master who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could inherit this church as well.
This was associated with the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two blocks on the tower.
The larger of the two were broken in Christmas in 1673.
The newly acquired Glock was then the first to sound in 1692, but was later released in World War II in 1942.
During the 30-year-old war (1616-1648) the windows were beaten and the clocks were stolen.
The roof was easy.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the office and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The rest of the church threatened to fall in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last place of rest for the deceased from hearing screws.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius church was broken.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the night of the New Year in 1834, a storm split into the church tower and half fell down.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken.
Only the present-day turmoil was received as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen pensioners" as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn take care of the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, Tumlingen’s friends and promoters invited on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
This is formed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium joy city and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
The local leader Hartmut Romans speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 15:30 p.m.
To explode the Serenade, a turning place takes place in front of the funeral.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over the trees to the forest," the organizers exhibit the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is of importance for Tumlingen and listeners.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organisator Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check the approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim turns back" does not see a legal prerequisite for the construction and therefore has turned to the country council.
Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) has requested to withdraw his approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
She was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time only at the town border to Schwalmtal had existed a wind power concentration zone in Four.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants is essentially possible, but at the same time the concentration zone is an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such areas are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind energy concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier by a change in the area’s plan of use, but the district government did not approve Düsseldorf because of a form failure.
"Due to the lack of planning legal condition, the issued approval report is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawing," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim.
Current state of things: The City Council has re-decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; the district government is still approved.
"The authorisation for the establishment of wind energy plants is therefore legally excluded."
The circle confirms the entry of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been in the Circle of Fouresen since last week," a spokesman said.
The circle takes it to the occasion of re-examination of the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
With regard to the ongoing proceedings in the administrative court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express content to the argument of the association "Boisheim refers to".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of wind wheels every 200 meters high in an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Fouresen is indirectly involved, had concluded pact contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of large land.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the electricity need can be covered by about 11,400 households, which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Quartersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in Windpark Linnich bei Aachen, as well as participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the circle of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor collapse: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was deadly injured.
Two more people were mildly injured.
The road remained locked for hours.
Police reports that a 17-year-old woman from Bornich took a car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion took the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and traders plan "Hoimat Shopping" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are intended to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.
The trade union and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract residents to the shopping mall in the city centre.
As Christian König, Chairman of the Commercial Association, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" week aims to sensibilize customers to what offers the city offers beyond the usual supermarket goods.
Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the week market.
In addition, domestic companies will present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the stores of the city centre are invited to the "midnight shops".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, advertising spots in the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.
City administration and trade associations cooperate with the industrial and trade chamber.
Thus, the trade association and the city will go into another stage of the project "Attractive centre city".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" to the spring party, as well as the sales sofa Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and cancellation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be renewed or refined.
These include travellers and tourists.
But also many locals had lost the city centre from the sight when shopping.
In the end, everyone has to contribute to living the city centre - to renters, the operations of the whole city and associations.
It was necessary to overcome the lethargie, which was partially widespread with a network, the king said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "Homat-Shoppen" day, for the first time, participated in five Thüringer cities.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleichered.
The day is intended to "promote for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common interest of our cities," Streich said.
The action led by the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his own purchasing behavior.
Two deaths and several injured after an explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine more were injured, some of which were severely severe.
According to the firefighter, on Wednesday (local time) another injured was in a critical state.
A man died when part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
One missing man was also later secured dead.
The dead were school employees.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
For holidays, only few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pushed Mexican telephone calls after secured transcripts for payment of border walls
Transscripts of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President accused him of being publicly opposed to the wall. According to reports, he said, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an exciting exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "laughing", "mies" and "dumm" and that the existence of the trade passed by the Obama government would make him look like a "deep" after he proposed a ban on refugees residing to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Mass: Activists Release Racist Lynchakt as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury led by a group of viewers in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with weapons came out to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip dress - took a long train on his cigarette and looked checking through the wind protection plate.
Inside, the prisoners were frightened.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" the man shouted.
"Sleep him out of the car!"
The screaming breaks the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a depiction.
But if a shell is then thrown around the neck by "Roger", almost everyone in the audience pulls out very real seufers.
Since 2005, citizens' lawmakers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were beaten by the Ku Klux Clan in 1946.
No one was accused of murder.
“It’s really unreasonable that no one has been arrested in all these years – although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the organization of the detection.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime citizen.
For him, the detection serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want justice, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
“We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A court physician puts a beddog on the body of one of the victims of Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI documents received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever accused.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, citizen lawmakers say that the double motivation for the Lynch action was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed the Black Citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election fight in the summer.
Approximately at the same time as the election was reported by the FBI by the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white ground owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly for a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she weared was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white land owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it seems, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," a FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a complot between state and local law enforcement, which not only involved in the murders, removed evidence and hindered the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks makes it even more impressive.
"It was a voting law massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are allowed to register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual showcase of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch.
Their imagination is visible, greedy and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it is no longer in America.
It’s hard to look, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about this link because we’ll be confronted with its jealousy in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve done.”
The samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - were forced into a room and shouted when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes Co-director here.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
“I feel boring because I’m not like that,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to return to those times.”
On the other hand of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who cries out Hester and annoys him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks in laughter.
Greene laughs at the latest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't think white people said 'n' at that time."
"But," said one of the other black actors.
"You just have to meet the hard R."
And that’s where energy moves into the room, a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy to achieve this correctly, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with repression.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screaming, shooting, and then silence.
A woman dressed in a sorrow dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' sad praise "Strange Fruit".
His voice breaks in every second word.
A group of about four dozens of spectators covers swiftness and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A pair of people from Ithaca, New York, come to see the show, many just come down the street.
They've all experienced Georgia's pressure moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the graveyard of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrim journey.
To this point the murder has remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels breathtaking.
When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hang on their heads, register the fake blood, and the breastfeeding bodies, and flourish each other.
"They're not really dead," said a little boy as if he wanted to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lyrics and throw away their tears.
Bradshaw humbled Marbaugh, the man in the dress who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona crawls two of his co-players and then breaks together in her arms crying, and finally breaks the emotional burden of the performance with him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women flirts.
“We know that this is not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white pair of Atlanta is excited to show up with a black pair that they’ve just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that the performance had left.
“It’s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she said.
"What really does to me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on," she added, "today it's just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the show next year.
“The imagination is somehow inspiring because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, whoever does not know his own story, is condemned to repeat it.”
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a color-free inscension in front of a gigantic, six-story cult.
The rotary scene (formed by Alexander Denic) is selectively showing a sharp street corner, along with a wall-reste and rotary building in Berlin, a "plate and elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-old clock is parked, where the Rhine-girls are positioned as rockergirls, or alternatively a isetta.
Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power, and gender - draws through his "ring" inscension.
The three Rhine daughters - songs by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmball and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as beautifully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess executes Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), sews a body in Hollywood’s way into the luggage room and give the Krawallo Click.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent featuring hagen surrounded by the Aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanked the ensemble with a strong applause.
Storms are celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and Director Janowski, who humbled himself and denied his hands to the Merkel rage.
There is a big accident for the festive orchestra, which appears for the first time on the stage - given the great heat again in the alloy leisure clothes.
With tension, the appearance of Frank Castorf and his team was expected.
In 2013, if he had to make a valid peep concert over himself, there was a big jubilee five years later, in which the unified "Buh" calls were undergoing.
Katharina Wagner may have enjoyed it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the 'ring' in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its perspective.
I'm going to take a positive summary.
Max is working as a volunteer.
They work in several locations during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school in the open day.
How are your experiences with this?
Many: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so you are a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Many: I have made a habit.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully disrupted.
I realized for myself that it was wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you're doing.
Make a social year, there’s an insight, there you can see how it’s in place, at the burning point, maybe, really.
And was it that way?
Many: I have collected great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my study in social sciences.
I’m going to study dual, probably make a social work training at Herne’s youth office and study in Hamm at the High School.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where to make your FSJ.
You can make it from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statistics.
You have always had other people who have a completely different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family – you must always take care of it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have the fear of touching?
Many: That's why I'm not the guy.
It is an area that gives a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that’s how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to restore the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediates by 72 percent, as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job loss, which John Fallon, chiefly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, with 4,000 jobs already lost.
Pearson announced in May, in a third cost reduction program, a plan to reduce costs by £300 million (394 million) to revive a business taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company that sold its participation in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month said that the prospect of the financial year was unchanged after it achieved a growth of 1% to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul's convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to uncertain local reports, three civilians died in the incident in Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last violent attack that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
In a NATO statement, the explosion took place on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "improvised explosion weared by people".
The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1,662 civilian deaths were reported in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of which in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly schiotic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly military attack since the U.S.-led troops dropped the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the prejudiced security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA returns decision to delay Smog rules to appeal
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has repealed a decision to delay Obama’s government regulation, which states are obliged to reduce smog-related emissions, which took place a day after 15 states complained of the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "ozone regulations 2015" and said it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in the fact that we respond to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone regulations - in which they will be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, along with the District of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has attempted to return a wide range of environmental challenges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the relapse of Democrats and Nature Protection groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says inhalation of air that contains ozone "reduces lung function and can reinforce respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants a Community Room
At the end, the decision was clear: in two contra-votes, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to establish a Community area in the future senior housing facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the lacking part of the property is signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take up until the area belonging to the church community is owned by the municipality, there is no longer any impediment to planning for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community room for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council are concerned, such a Community room is not only a meeting point for the residents of the senior residents, but also open to the municipality.
For example, the word "Strick Café" made the round.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn, is encouraged by means of funding opportunities.
The building is located in the restoration area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, Tjaden reported, with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The decision proposal sets out to signal the investor that you do not want to throw a knife between the legs in this regard, suggesting that both Sattel - which is attached to environmental construction - and Pult roof - would be possible, which reduces the height of the trail and makes the construction more economically.
Unnecessary, not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this supplement.
If it helps, he will happen to the board.
It is not so easy for the community room.
Daniela refers to the many own buildings with which you don’t get so far, so you are now rejected from the community room out of the window, she says, “I do hard to do with it.”
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking for the Community room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden grant to any assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area, you don't receive a grant, but you get a real counterpart, in doubt, is the counterpart.
Staiger's request to split the draft decision will find three supporters.
In two oppositions in the original program, Stefan Haller summarizes: “When we make this decision, we will make a huge step towards closing a huge disadvantage in our infrastructure.”
Collision with car: wheeler is sliding on the road
During the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured and injured by a car in Garath on Wednesday.
As police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on his bike on the road of the road Black road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him a priority.
When the Langenfelder traveled on the road, he seemed to not pay attention to the opposite traffic.
He collapsed with a car that led a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was scratched on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a retreat truck.
FC Bayern Munich must resign at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund against David Alaba and Thiago
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game against Dortmund sauce.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals miss the title defender in the Super Cup against the Cup winner.
The personal care of the German football champion Bayern Munich is increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at the Borussia Dortmund Cup.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also abandon David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
Also, the Munichers miss Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeats in the past six test matches and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
“We know that we are not in the best physical constitution,” said Ancelotti and added, “the most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good at the end.”
But the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
“We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “heavy, intensive game”.
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts fans into their bands.
The match was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) reported on Friday.
Walking in the rain of stars to stars
In Harz, the first "star path" should be created across the federal.
This is planned by the Association Starwart Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information of many harvest visitors, he said.
It connects nature, science, exercise and sport performance.
Members want to set tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations at five to six places" in the Upper Harz.
Inquiries come from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network acceptance plays a role in choosing location.
Barrier freedom is also a criterion.
Later, the Starway train will be extended around the train.
“On the Starway, viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars,” the association said.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why a star brighter than another, although it is far farther away.
It is also disclosed in which star image is a selected star and when it is best to see.
The association has been operating since 2014 in St. Andreasberg, the highest-located Northern Germany’s stellarch.
The location in the center of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often there is a clear view from the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with just an eye.
In the city of Uni-City, there is something similar to the planned star storm - the planet road since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder Universe Planetarium Göttingen.
Starting from Gebhard’s hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet’s road, with its stairs, leads up to Hainberg and to the Star Wars - as well as a “external” location in Diemarden (Community Equals) with the planet Sedna.
The planes with the individual planets, including the Pluto degradated to the wildplanet at the end point, are set precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth crashes to a ball of 6.5 mm diameter, while the precise 75 metres standing sun measured 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planet road is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to reach the star with Pluto.
Walkers are faster than light in the universe.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be standing in a collision course to insect the most exciting boxing race under £147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unfinished World Boxing Council lightweight champion, the flur went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super Weightweight Champion.
After Garcia’s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Divisions World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 5 p.m. at ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis observed climate that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former fever weight," Garcia recalled.
“I’m up for bronze [to 140 pounds], but I’m not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to lightweight.
And he has to move on to light weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s give them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pounds debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) which also interests in the fight against Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winners.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked him," Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he might participate in his Saturday battle.
But Lomachenko stayed at the generous praise for Garcia and said he thought the Riverside Triangle champion looks "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus was to show strike strength, then box.
Both said they could feel the moment that was built for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that must be done.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighter, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tire place
In an accident on the A7, four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira was likely lost control over its vehicle at 16.30 a.m. just before the connector's marketwidth after a tire place.
The truck slipped right into the badge, where he crossed and then stayed on the roof in the green strip.
The four prisoners – two adults and two children – were injured in the accident.
While the first supply of the injured by the rescue service was shut down to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left ride track could be passed at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three Chain Works Better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to start the season against Braunschweig that optimization of the defence formation brings points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, as well as the result, the two gates wouldn't have been against Brunschweig at 2:2.
“There were too many two counter doors, and we have to be careful even better in Aue,” said Fortuna Düsseldorf’s defender.
The triangle chain is also expected to be optimized in the mountains.
And a door after a free stop, the fortunates no longer want to catch themselves.
“For the future it will be so that no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing) anymore.”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, even after the experience in the preparation of the three-chain, will meet better than with the four-chain.
“I still don’t know how we’re going to act in Aue,” said Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, “because we have players on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build well,” Hoffmann said.
“The prerequisite is that we are even better harmonised and we don’t make so many gambling mistakes in construction.”
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
“But if you can talk about a failed start, you don’t know.
The performance could be quite fine,” said Hoffmann.
“But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular seasonal uptake.”
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I'll judge the start of the season only after six to eight games days," Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage to Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be discontinued prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said, "the Aue players might even be a little fresher because they didn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones."
“But they don’t know as much as 100 percent where they are currently,” Fortuna’s internal defender said.
Although guests from Rhineland go to the final (fast) prepared stadium of Aue as a lighter favourite on Sunday.
“The only reason we have the right to get under the first six is foolishness,” Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at just a defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the Second Bundesliga to beat in front of," Fortunas Chefcoach explains.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel never wants to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Assessment Tests
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden that have been subjected to a new medical method for assessing their age shows that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (the Legal Medicines Agency) started testing last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration agency (migration agency) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age.
Until today, Migration Agency has sent 6,880 to test cases, and Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person’s age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
"We see no big difference in statistics of the past few months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in the journal The Local.
The high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases suggesting that the investigated person is 18 years or older.
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age evaluation, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints, then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the evaluation of human biological maturity to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had a reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Assessment of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
“If we can’t say it safely, we shouldn’t do it as if we could,” he said to the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson by the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “Generally, you can say that the risk of unfairly assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is almost under 18, this is about 10 percent.”
Full of plan
The work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday, a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
“We are very good in time, it’s running great,” says Reinhold Leicht, the construction manager at the Department of Road and Transport at the Government Presidency Freiburg.
In April, the work began at the same time on all three repair bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is intended for October and easy to ensure that the schedule is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the trumpet.
It is a concrete valve bridge covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly restored.
The other two bridges run over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and were 12, or 10,60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metres wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tonnes of heavy bridge cap.
This is a border fixture, which is also used as an operating path.
On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap will be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path will be gone.
The particular thing is that it is a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
In particular, the fingertips feel requires conducting through the construction in Lauterbach.
There is also a glass fiber cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handwriting about the project.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building building and the assembled building in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is uniformly regulated by an amplifier.
For the construction work on the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieb Linden".
The cost of the three bridge repairs is EUR 700 000.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter protest at German potato salad
It does not occur so often that parties are drawn on a strang, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise hard to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volcanoefel (CDU, SPD, green, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a wide alliance that shows that day peacefully the flag, because the AfD in Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "Great Elections Opposition".
And well-known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel, which together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who have been in place for hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD-learning but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eiffel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking lot under the Rondell - and thus directly in the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A beautiful picture that is offered there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forum A World and one of the relevant organizers, is really happy: "Good how many people have come together here."
There is music and any amount of food, including a “German potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problems,” says the woman who brought him.
Police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few meters away from the events locations.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reported that he has strived for such an event and received the addition.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a request in Daun, but there was a refusal because there were not enough parking because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
So the Rondell, Hompes, is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
In view of the event on the Rondell Square, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: at about 20 p.m. on the Rondell Square, there is a band for entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the rheinland-paled AfD President Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour the AfD event takes, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but also there is anxiety to clean up shortly after 21:00.
Police can refrain - no special incidents.
Posaune meets trumpets
A hearing with the Wolfacher trumpetist Frederic Belli is held in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets in Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also meets a classical German training with roots in blastic music.
Both soloists are winner and prize winner of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So Petkov is Solotrompeter at the famous Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphonie Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries of their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new dress, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the song "Exchange Suite" of the Jazz Award winner Nils Wogram, classic, jazz and free game mix into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core part of the program was introduced only this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The famous composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart Speaks About His Bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"When I'm hungry in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's going on next?"
The Hollywood star’s most famous relationship was the one with her “Twilight” colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually bitterly struggled.
Nevertheless, the brunette caregiver insured the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with any of my thoughts.
Or do you think I would have played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I have always lived dualism and seriously believed it.
It has never confused or disturbed me before.
I just never liked to be taken seriously.”
Especially under that, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, rather than dressing like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, frightened and shamed.
Now I look back and think of me, ‘Girl, be proud of you.’”
In particular, the public does not like to explain their love life: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that irritates me.
And maybe some call me unthankful, but I don’t like to justify myself in front of the whole public.”
Governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a customer meeting with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me,” said Gouverneur Justice.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia that I can’t help you if I’m a democratic governor.”
The announcement broke out in Jubel.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mining in five states, and he has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying, "The party exchange of Governor Justice is another strike for a Democratic party that would rather hinder us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, uncommon message," RNC president Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises Russian "honest" apology for doping scandal
The world leader of the body athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an open apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated it wasn’t the time for the country to get back into the sport.
Russian body athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress at the night of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s rejection of the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said he regretted "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals during competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the prohibition imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized itself that it had experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "rejoicing" to accept Russia's criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been achieved, but the Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to reuse Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guide principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nine Russian athletes will play as neutral actors at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a resettlement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Trauer act for fallen soldiers in Mali
At a sad celebration in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two thought of the soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Dom under high security measures.
On the unexplained cause of the collapse, Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She called the two deceased pilots as "children of her branch."
"We reject this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old staff captain from North Hessen died on Wednesday a week ago in Western Africa.
Their seats were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a dead guard of the Federal Defense to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church received goodbye.
Afterwards, the grief celebration in the circle of the family, closest friends, by representatives of the Federal Army and politics.
Hessen’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector-general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were also included.
Trauer guests laid roses, the relatives standing in arms on the shell.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a linens wall.
The Defence Minister of Leyen described the dead soldiers as "high decorated" and user experience.
The Stabshauptman has built the flight operation of the fighter crawler Tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained tiger pilots in his regiment.
Volker Bauersach, commander of the Regiment, to which the soldiers belong, also said: "If this occupation could not deny the collapse, no one would have been able to do so."
Due to the UN mission in Mali, Minister Leyen did not show that the use was dangerous.
But it is also of high importance “for a country from which we are separated by only two states,” she said.
After the grief celebration, the seals were taken out of the dome.
When and where they will be charged, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn’t want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is suspended in the Dom Church of Roskilde.
The photographer Bjørn Nørgaard has already prepared a sarcophage for the two.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, she continued in the statement.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, it is still unclear.
He did not intend to be awarded to his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a hint that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the reign of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also gave the title "Principal Food".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not look equivalent to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House, said.
Where the 83-year-old’s last resting place will finally be, it’s still unclear.
He did not intend to be inherited in his French country, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years.
Born by Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble gender, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked in the French Embassy at the Themse.
During his later wife, the sympathy of the people always flew, Prince Henrik had a severe state in his nearly 50-year-old reign in Denmark.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluent, I preferred wine instead of beer, seed stripes instead of strikes, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia’s tobacco, who had the reputation to be the brand of social-critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope to supervise.
I was different.
I seem to be satisfied with this position and not to shame me.
It was just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is, after the loss of the red-green majority of governments for a rapid new election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because he spoke to the dismissal of the parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprise departure of a Green Member from their country-day group in Lower Saxony had fallen into a severe crisis by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD).
Five months before the official election, the Red-Green coalition in Hannover lost its short-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its election circle in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler recommends his group to take it up.
In addition, CDU and FDP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was the opposite.
The new country day will be regularly elected on January 14 next year.
Thümler said the red-green country government should now decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it indispensable that the Land Day decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The country’s constitution also provides the possibility that the country’s day will withdraw the trust of the Prime Minister and choose a successor.
“Our constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally clean,” Thümler said.
“All questions will be discussed in a quiet manner if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twestens step "but something curious".
The politician himself stressed: “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She called herself a supporter of black-green.
The Greens urged the deceased Members to return their country mandate.
"We, of course, expect that she returns her country's mandate that she received through the green country list with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
Green Group Chairman Anja Piel said, “We regret the decision of each Twesten extraordinarily.”
She has consciously decided not to make a statement in the group.
"Even in the background that there were no content differences, we can't understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transition of the Lower Saxony Green Deputy Elke Twesten to the CDU as a traitor.
"The behaviour of the former Green Deputies in Lower Saxony is not only betrayed to voters, but also betrayed to Red Green," the Federal Head of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly reelection the country day.
The exit Twest costs the majority of red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician puts "in her injured jealousy and in her frustration her personal interests in the welfare of the country," SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony contributes to this dirty intrigen game and tries to beat political capital from it.”
Lower Axis CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler will advise his deputy to incorporate each Twesten into the CDU.
The group head of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested Twesten to mislead the result of the country’s 2013 election with personal career consideration.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Green had a thin majority of one vote on the landday.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the Redaktions Network Germany (RND) speech and response.
Mr. Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to carefully view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the steam pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.livesmittel warning.de, the federal countries will provide the latest information about the affected egg chargers.
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know right now, a health risk is virtually excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the acclaimer is not really realized by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the duty of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately switched off and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade as well as the manufacturers ensures that the products sold are transportable and healthily undoubtedly.
If the residual maximum of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the businesses are not blameless.
Are producers and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production firms are not responsible for direct guilt.
Instead, they have to calculate economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there is too little control.
Is it lacking only in staff or also in decisive jurisdiction?
It was just the official checks that discovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100%.
That is why consistent clarification of such events and transfer to the prosecutors in cases where crimes may be present are crucial.
I have already repeatedly stated that I am expecting an uncomfortable explanation from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarming in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers are justified.
Through the powered fund, manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
It must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the report will be informed quickly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European soccer clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any consequence will still come for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, because the leading organization that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must prove that Neymar’s transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly make money locker to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the team’s financing by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must pay taxes with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break up even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007.
The former French players believed that associations who had taken huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from focusing on club debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair.
During the current three-year FFP deployment period that runs until 2018, clubs can raise losses of €30 million.
And although Platini has fallen by the presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to strive to fear excessive expenses.
"Of course, FFP is not dead, and we will still reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a pause, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the expenditure can be allocated to EUR 44.4 million for the next five years in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG and Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, met with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million ($82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered to be a legitimate income.
That was what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was increased by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the World Cup 2022 Organizational Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have contested that Neymar will become WM ambassador and could be easy to find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG means that UEFA will be even more careful to observe any attempt to overcome the rules.
UEFA had no prepared talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, the people who are familiar with the situation said Thursday.
They talked to The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a sale of 542.4 million euros, has earned a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and trikot sales.
The association is expected to increase sales by at least 30% after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar’s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS, said regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoon, shares the reserves of La Liga against a state that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire football landscape in the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as a country has a association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has manufactured aboard chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the cute cooperation is facing a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwest Switzerland" on Friday at the request of the news agency.
According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and undergo quality control.
“With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied,” said the spokesperson.
Around 17 million small red-white shoggi tables are distributed to passengers by 14 grams per year before landing.
The Swiss didn’t want to provide information about the costs.
Industry users estimate the order volume, according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about a billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect is always: for a shoe manufacturer, it is a prestigious task.
How many candidates are present in the new tender, Swiss do not want to betray.
Only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the agreement on spring 2018.
For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has distributed chocolate tables on board since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with Migros’ daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class will be deprived of the Confiserie Sprüngli, naked passengers Schoggi by Lindt and the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Leach athletics - Discussion Olympic winner Robert Harting reaches the WM final
The three-time world champion fights for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the Olympic winner of 2016, failed at the National Championship Award and could only watch the discussion competition from the Tribuns.
Also, with the first attempt, Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Niche
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars went larger, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poddler.
As a cultural effect, it is also a parodie and an encompassing of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original story for a spoken dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By falling into the core of the Gag - actors of medieval age playing jealous children who will grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the principle of gießkane, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character is struck by an Apple Powerbook, some inline taxes and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novel author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-wholesome slot included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It is particularly fun to see Mr. Rudd, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old kidnapper.
These are the moments of random madness that could warm this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how they will see the film premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-to-western ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests being a found television series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – a harshly-soupted Gregor and an idealist Joseph – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogue is synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a great idea.
But it’s not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend the time watching shakes on television as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers – including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny – provides a decent game ‘Find the voice out’.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the reality of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays as one.
With six long episodes, it moves there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", edited for a lesser length, could deliver better his agitprop satires, since Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who shake a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginated communist audience is that Western culture can make everything food for a situation.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and theirs.
Battle of drug mafia in the country
Police hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in Blackwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, as state prosecutor Konstanz reported on Friday.
15 accused have been arrested between 25 and 77 years old and have already adopted arrest orders against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two people were arrested in Italy.
There were German arrests against the two suspected Italians.
They are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were employed.
The members of the mafia are accused of organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, and thieves and oppression.
Since summer 2016, the Prosecutor’s Office has established constant anti-organised drug trafficking in the southern German area.
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a strict exchange, and Kripo Rottweil’s investigators had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large intervention was also accompanied by four Palermo officials on Wednesday morning.
In view of the investigations, Italian citizens with a close link to the Italian mafia.
Also, an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a guest place early in the morning, is likely to go to the band account.
Wisely complains about big disadvantages in the foreign register
"Data of citizens that should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany shows significant deficiencies.
This leads to some serious deficiencies in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Mode, has noted large disadvantages in the Foreign Central Register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "particular deficiencies" in asylum procedures and discharges, warned in an analysis contained in the "South German newspaper".
According to the report, 10 million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data has not been properly maintained, the quality of the data in parts has not been good until now.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who haven't been alive anymore, or of citizens who have become German citizens and shouldn't actually appear in the registry."
"Incorrect data access can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
In addition, the statistics on travelling people include EU citizens who do not have to travel.
Such false assignments, however, led to "a disrupted debate on dealing with travellers," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they have gone from there.
This is based on an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), according to the New Osnabrücker newspaper.
According to the paper, the BAMF "repeatedly conducts such procedures for families with children - with the exception of infants and minors - to Italy since 1 June 2017.
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this country can send him back to the country of arrival.
For the reason, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased".
Italy has provided warranties for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the internal political spokesman of the left group in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of human rights unlawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare."
The second result is achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service had already been available to other people.
At least of the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community honors the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the Municipal Council.
“It’s great how our body is designed for it and we have to respect the donors who provide their blood to strangers yet unintentional,” said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explains the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conserves are divided into their components.
There are three people who can benefit from a donation of blood.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions to be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK Round Preparation Leader.
Obviously, the shift to the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many of Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger have booked, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Widow Vetter spend ten times per 500 milliliters of their juice.
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have pushed speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slow" when it maintains interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The policymakers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 %, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budget revenue would continue, with inflation expected to rise to nearly 3% in autumn.
But she signaled that interest rate increases would be necessary in the coming years to reduce the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted for withdrawing part of the Mammut economic turkey package released a year ago after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15 billion more under this system - with £115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: “In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as pressure on household real income continues to burden consumption.”
In addition to the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "slightly bigger" extent than the markets expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that increases would be "stagefully" and "limited".
The bank's growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasted in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision will not be changed after the recent disappointing growth rates have dropped the expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3 percent in the third quarter, although it will be easily recovered by the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by increasing inflation and low wage increases, as the worsening is getting even worse first before it gets better.
She added that monetary policy could not “hinder” the infringement of income in the next few years, but she added that the wages will be “clearly” recovered at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate for a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes a year after the lower rates to 0.25 percent in August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the drop of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this reaches the prices and the economy completely.
Before the bank's last judgment on interest rates, the reputation was increased after an increase in interest rates, as inflation increased the pressure on households with three political decision-makers demanding a rise of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9 percent in June last month to 2.6 percent, although the bank said it was expected and it would be re-attracted in the coming months.
The bank said that the surplus in proportion to its target of 2% was awarded "ganz" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In the light of the recent decline in the Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as borrowers are looking loudly for stores and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and conclude the new mortgage, and many with free options and low rates become increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe 10 000 HIV Drugs
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment since September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England reported that a preexposition profilaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which could reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients, is now delivered by the healthcare service over the first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to finance the proceedings after the appeal court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chassis announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "important new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) referred to this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to allow people to sign up, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposition profilaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risks.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered with a home doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for delivery of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is targeted to be used in large scale, absorbed and implemented.
Stevens said, “This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the ongoing progress in addressing one of the biggest health challenges of humanity for more than three decades.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is aimed at people in need and threatened, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us get closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society."
The big life: intermediate and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
“I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room before,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and she had the same high roofs.
I fell in love with her and made a offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overgrown.
Originally, a one-room property with a packed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add space and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceiling, large windows, lots of light.
That was my demand,” she said.
For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceiling and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which you could stand.
He had to think creatively in order to solve the order.
“The steelwork is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stitched over each other without having to push.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed the invention to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of extra drama.
For the middle floor, a classic copper light window of retrovius looks down the glamourous living area.
Mirror gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is reflected to make it work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into a different room.
At the entrance, reflected units offer space for all the barbecues and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a more glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collective kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage.
"A little engineering art went in there," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's contraweight, so when you move the door, it's very easy to slide."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne won additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the ground area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate broker will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to expand the floor surface while simultaneously using high-quality materials that provide the room with its luxury advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and thus help you create an emotional bond in a home,” Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased number of square meters from somewhat standard to something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.
Brothers Fight for $500 Million Real Estate Empire
Two brothers are located for four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a struggle for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide his property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the forest.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
This means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, after several missing mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business – from what Colin, as Paul claimed, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some property incompliance.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to deal with the dispute.
“My Italian legacy suggests that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers offices held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans store of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he "was in my last years in high school when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the company and Luke was paid $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, “the conditions of their financial separation have been overwhelmed.”
Colin remained very back, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Just Colin answered by SMS to say, “I can’t really say much,” because the case is in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and draw our family names through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "are still hoping for a solution."
This hope seemed to have ended on Friday.
“Our affair will be resolved in the near future by the courts,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried it and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If yes, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports, in the hope of keeping the head on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new staff chief of the White House, met on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow – whether on paper or in letterings – because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to pick up Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television has been back for decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“When Trump’s candidate was angry for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from posts that were to be convinced,” former election adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control is, according to six former election officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise prize.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know others – that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuels without their interventions.
We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his employees have been able to keep it from him a few times, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from arguing.
One part of the problem is that people in a White House consisting of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico, who is fully busy with this story, reported in May about the counsellor’s preference to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Actual and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with harmful leaks, and that he is trying to figure out where they come from.
At the end of February, someone willingly gave the President a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused deputy staff chief Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a crowd of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of scams, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that in the past he has expressed false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to survey employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General, Rob Porter, “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram received by Trump.”
How did that happen?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most searched criminals get post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is asked and hoped.
Police across Europe are sending this summer (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on escape.
Since the addresses of the searched severe crimes are naturally unknown, indices from the population are expected and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday the action following the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
The experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, Europol said.
There were 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches could have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a tomb and return to 'Millioner Series'
Some of the most wealthy house owners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers on war foot who have negotiated a tomb pulled out of the municipality to retreat a field in front of their master’s houses.
Travellers have parked their 20 housing cars on a field outside of a rich street of Solihull, called the Millionaire Series.
They brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being dropped out of a tomb buried by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactical group found a block in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unprecedented to find a way.
Angry residents have oppressed the advice of Solihull, who said "it is useless to deal with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved to the place on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passports.
The Council must be forced to implement it by shame as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved and now returned.
More came yesterday night, probably even more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who didn’t want to be called, said, “It’s ridiculous, we’ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be wrapped up by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokeswoman of the Solihull Council said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case.”
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof will be the woodhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
These are good news for the city.
By closing the Birkenhof Hotel by the then ambient company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost, as well as revenue from the Kurtatax.
In autumn 2014, given the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming into the countryside, the hotel building was offered to the countryside as a collection accommodation, providing controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the Municipal Council at that time.
But above all, Freudenstadt’s Oberbürger Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about serious stakeholders at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The group of Luisen hotels with headquarters Birgit Scherer, headquartered in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof on a voluntary rise in Berlin and wants to turn it back into a house of the three-star plus category called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the city of joy.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has long been present before the entrance, and when you enter the house, it is clear how extensive renovation work is carried out.
The floors were cut off, roofs were partially cut off, old bathrooms were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is one building.
There is still a lot to do until March.
“It’s really a nice hotel,” says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large enthusiastic showers, the entrance area will be redesigned, new windows will be installed.
Everything would later become "good bourgeois", as Thomas Scherer expressed.
"We want to make a jewelry out there."
A swimming pool, a wellness area and a meeting room include amenities.
You don’t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a high level in the city centre, Scherer stresses.
The woodhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to stay wide, explains Scherer.
Whether individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel well at the hotel.
He has already conducted talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, Scherer.
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself.
Almost below a million euros, he expects.
The external plants are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard there is a large terrace that will be publicly accessible from the restaurant.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia's Special Detective: U.S. Special Detectives Install Grand Jury
In the Russian affair on U.S. President Donald Trump, Special Detective Robert Mueller has set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The Board has taken up the work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already the first charges of the board in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of being targeted to be involved in the 2016 presidential election.
Mueller investigates whether there were negotiations between Trump’s election team and Moscow.
There are several men who acted as an adviser of the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump’s private and business environment under the lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Detective Trump personally entered the center and examined the claim whether the president may have hindered justice during the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether the charge is to be filed.
Grand Jurys is therefore also called prosecution chambers.
Often they are turned on when it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The Board may also be enacted by the prosecutor's office to provide persons for hearing under oath.
According to the CNN broadcaster, talks have already been issued about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who participated in the meeting were invited to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and widow son Jared Kushner were also involved in the talks, as well as his then election leader Paul Manafort.
Law experts told the U.S. television on Thursday night that the institution shows that Mueller does not make himself scared in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be enacted at the end to decide on the charges.
However, the establishment of the Board is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason to worry about President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The theme gives Democrats a way to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.
His Special Advisor Ty Cobb said in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
However, they usually work secretly, he emphasized.
The White House supported any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be identified against the president.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed, the statement continued.
Mueller was used only after Trump had fired Comey.
Due to this prosecution, allegations against Trump were made strongly, he wanted to hinder justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to postpon investigations against then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees.
This solved speculations about whether Trump wanted to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congress investigator, such as in the Watergate affair for the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on President’s urgency by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented on Thursday legislative drafts that could no longer be dismissed by the Special Investigator.
Antarctica: Gigantic Iceberg moves in Antarctica
In the western Antarctica, a giant iceberg has almost seven times the size of Berlin has been dissolved from the shellfish.
This was reported by the Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
Over a billion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of colossus now move to the north and it will probably take two to three years until it is collapsed.
It has a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the last three decades.
A danger for people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice screws in the region for about 30 years, the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this can be linked to the warming of the earth.
The now broken Coloss was a part of the Larsen-C screw feather.
Sealfish swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C seal feather is located nearly on the top of the Antarctic Peninsula, south of South America.
In the north, the balance of growth and discontinuation was disturbed a few years ago.
A total screw was broken there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.
There is a lot of mention that the Larsen-C-skeleton is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can break if you break a piece at a key point.
The melting of salt and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice dry as much water as it produces after melting itself.
Nevertheless, the loss of screws leads to that the glaciers can go directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This could potentially increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project for observation of the Antarctic (Midas) writes.
According to AWI, the Larsen C-skeleton is the fourth-largest skeleton of Antarctica, with nearly 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down there regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is aware of us, the ice shelf is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
“This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of the recordings,” he also confirmed.
Among scientists was controversial whether the Larsen C-scale will grow again or return back in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not bring back the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed over the past decades.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice surface has declined to 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has been warmed by about three degrees in the past 50 years and is among the areas where the temperature is rising faster.
CDU wants a household rate for staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free jobs, the CDU calls for a resignation from the employer association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag has crossed 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and employees work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
There are once again 17 trainers behind their first working day.
The curriculum in the circle is apparently very desired.
Around 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be assigned this year.
However, the circle lacks further staff to manage the increasing requirements and tasks.
At the moment, there are still 50 non-occupied positions at the Mettmann Circle.
Doctors and engineers are searched for, among other things, as well as the powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative, together with the FDP and the UWG, and to respond to the lack of staff in the administration.
The administration is intended to "develop a concept for staff gain and staff development" according to the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals, but also to address future-oriented candidate shortages.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show specific measures for cross-border drivers and include a training offensive, calls for CDU, FDP and UWG.
This is just after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn’t know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is about a regular "competition of the public employers".
This leads to a large number of employees who are separated from the service due to illness or age.
Therefore, it is time to act so that no more jobs are left unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter people, the CDU Group Chief of Group, goes beyond the common request with his party.
He recently made a faust thick surprise in the circle, as he questioned publicly the staff costs and surprised the rest of the parties.
People want to be reviewed all possibilities that allow a retreat from the municipal employer association.
"If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term here, the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the circle-citizen cities - should seek a domestic tariff," people said.
Thus, the CDU seeks to pay the employees and officials better than it is actually provided for in the tariff order for the public service.
The wages are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money exist only if you switch to a higher level oriented to vocational years.
However, the circle’s tasks have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Lastly, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy Increases Ton to NGO Migrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had captured a boat of the German aid organization 'Yougend Rescue' because their team had effectively cooperated with traders in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express the detailed charges of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we can’t operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a social media statement.
“We can judge all charges that are currently collected only after we have collected all information and can evaluate the situation.”
The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of Jugend Rettet, the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew is taking on board sweatboat migrants delivered to them directly by human traders, and that the traffickers can depart so that the vessels can be used again.
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's document, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to avoid the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue measures in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have agreed to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring "essential changes or disabilities" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Winner Organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said now that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after rescue measures has declined strongly over the past few weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guards and cooperation with local mayors have produced fruit.
"In the last days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan Mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weiler biker, the "Berliner Outdoor Posts" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Falls to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley has proven to be a good starting point for tours.
Wachenheim's castle and wine festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led by warm summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which you could look far beyond the forest and the pre-reserved levels.
In the meantime, there were increasing increases, rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day, they went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, there was a point of view, associated with "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, a lot of heights were remarkable.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entrance halls brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathe in the outdoor inhalatorium healing sun.
New city was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4,500 meters of height, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side – sporting and culturally.
Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of going through wind and weather over the stadium races?
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry, a luxurious business – big stars, millions of fans and huge high-gage tournaments including.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga firms who are increasingly engaged in this area.
In the beginning of 2015, VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04, and last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
“We hope to enthusiastize new young target groups for the VfB,” said Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that there are still some associations on this train.
The FIFA World Cup will organize the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London next weekend, where the players of various clubs will join each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven.
Robin Dutt also sees a great potential in e-sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football needs to deal with, in particular, 14-30-year-olds, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old said.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sports under contract, you could be present online much more frequently on these markets than to send the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are contested.
Longest, as in normal sports, layers have been established in which the professionals are fighting against each other.
And in the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport at all?
For many, the idea is definitely customary.
Ingo Frobodse has long been dealing with this issue.
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which are also found in classical sport – for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and quick response capabilities.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also train their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobose also sees problems: “Doping becomes more and more a topic.”
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
The scientist emphasizes positively the high integrative effect of e-sport.
Players are on the road internationally, which is like a large global family because there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of corporate consulting Deloitte and the Federal Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts that e-sports will grow rapidly.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the sales will be 130 million.
That’s a little bit against nearly €2.4 billion in the Football League.
However, the e-sport is “not far away from other established sports such as handball, basketball or eishockey,” Deloitte advisers write.
Many countries are now international.
Large markets are Asia and the United States, where former basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the unique eSport bet provider.
There is also a lot in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as a teacher, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the First League Associations are now obliged to establish an E-Sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is behind," explains VfB CEO Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and declaring the ancient times, today is no longer enough.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time focusing the company on the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt also says.
“You can’t keep in mind that only in football everything remains as it always was.”
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and cooking
From the scandal about gift-loaded eggs, almost all federal countries are now affected.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and all eggs across Germany were taken from the sale.
Only other eggs that do not contain fipronyl should be taken into the reels.
Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy for suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide by texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, is going to spend 15 months of her conviction behind the fires and five years have been subjected to convictions.
Carter was sentenced to death in June for the murder of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: “My family is inconsistent.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter could stay free until the call.
She was confronted with a 20-year maximum punishment, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr. Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, stood there with tears in the eyes, with twisted hands and downward eyes when she was convicted.
“Your actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the lawyer told the court.
"He finished his life to make his own better.
She hasn’t taken any responsibility,” she said.
"She hasn't shown any repentance."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible situation that she completely regretted.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find out that "they have a significant impact on their actions, their age or maturity or even their mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said there is no day I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and as I go around with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains that we will bear with us for eternity,” he says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "traced" by knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or would be a tante for her children.
“Not having the only person I have been with since I was born every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case appears to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call for someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, start yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before she died while she was on vacation with her family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention by Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
A few of the Carter defenders were Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death for murders of her British co-habitant in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30-year-old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new FC Bayern Mini Lahm
Joshua Kimmich was a captain at the Audi Cup.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a large season - extra motivation does not harm.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra garment was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Newer was seen, he made the bonds assigned to him hold on his arm.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confed Cup winner said later, after his first effort as the Bavarian captain.
Well, the state could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach Kimmich could also say that.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was elected as a gamer in the C-Elf professionals from young players, debutists and just from vacation.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those you want to trust.
So those who have been decorated to inherit the inheritance of lame can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: “That’s what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew as a mini lahm over the field.
Right back, this is now his position, the white bonds on the arm made the rest of her.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this start-formation like the one who can even take the rover in the best hand.
He gave instructions, trying to guide the unplayed troops.
He had a whole look, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness (failed hardly); Renato Sanches with devils coming out to link to the performances of Asian travel (failed only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with no negative impact on their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot.
But it was very good.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy up before the defense, both acting sovereigns.
The namely-occupied Napoli storm often became difficult, and souls tried to succeed in gambling a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "wasn't as we hoped."
But he also showed a good performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "For this style I was also obtained".
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new entry, you can see after the match.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombes, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich apologized after a few knitting statements in the back of his new co-player.
There he heard about Süle an interesting phrase: "What goes out here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer has reported himself on Twitter just before the game, and the ladies of ÖFB wanted everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is almost a club colleague of ÖFB Captain Schnaderbeck and fevered with our ladies.
The Austrian footballer's tweet of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation injection.
Our ladies may also need the famous Bavarian duel.
Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often inconsistent when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still the Economy Minister of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This appears after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies in the region address T-V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time denounce the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies (VTU), says "Wissing raises the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all of them".
The largest return turn is seen by Natus in the infrastructure policy: the locking of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Still this year, the ministry hopes that the construction right will be stopped by 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the West Circle Trier, which is in the primary need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to launch the route in December 2020, says Minister spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus is a guide to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier strives, as Wissing urged, to launch a Rhineland-Pfalz label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for decades.
Wissing also has an open ear for people who want to create a company, the IHK praises.
The craft chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainers in the new master bonus, says CEO Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of EUR 1000 for the ongoing master examination and EUR 2500 is expected if graduates become independent within ten years of master’s training.
But the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of business at IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set up mobility in the country’s business, only 29 jobs have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
CDU fractional visa Christian Baldauf refers to the Court’s calculations, which the country invests more than €20 million in retention of national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus is also expecting a country’s concept to address the lack of skill in the region.
It is also an important part of the current broadband development in the country.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the network supply in a IHK survey with a note 3.4 only.
They complain about stunning internet connections and breaches.
Ex-Economy Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the Pro Wind wind power company.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private high school in Karlsruhe - where after four months, she was already out of the field due to disagreements.
Audi wants to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said it would offer updating the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", and this concerns European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the entrepreneurs as a resignation call.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install installations to neutralize emissions from diesel vehicles also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harming the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies try to avoid Volkswagen’s errors, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could control emissions to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but back to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were charged, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from deliveries and could be filed in court in the United States.
In early this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to overcome emission regulations in Europe, and a query focused on the United States was extended.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be difficult to charge Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes excessively to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message has the flood on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect Isar.
In order to participate in the Isar visitors, tomorrow Saturday, a flood will pass through Munich, which has a special message.
When it comes to Isar again on Saturday, there will be a great flood between Flaucher and Reichenbach bridge.
And this is not a common flood, with Isar tourists.
But it's the bauréferate to clarify.
On the floor you can see a great info-transparent.
It shows a Müllberg.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." it aims to strengthen the understanding of the Isar as a protective wild stream.
Last summer, the flood took place over the Isar, and also this year, there are further actions and measures to achieve a careful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos nose and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawers, the nozzles of his characters are his brand.
With 85, the Argentinian still plays and works on a movie.
His message: Laughing, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself, among other things, as a drawer of congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job,” he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60s of the break: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists of towns were always inspired.
Large, round-circuit Mordillo figures get stuck in drawings with the Pisa tower, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own data, he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, shirts and watches, his scary figures continue to spread around the world.
For six years, he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footage as an adversary.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film to come to the Kinole Wall in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
This is why he puts on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced orally.
Lavendel from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is decreasing due to dry conditions and insects transmitting diseases, which produces major headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The lavanda in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the impact of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the life of lavendel.
There is also a small zigzag, a microbacterial that transmits zigzag zigzags, and there are many of them in very dry weather.”
And there is a lot in the game.
Lavendel is not only attracted to holidaymakers, it is also very demanding for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with etheric oil.”
The solutions to be considered include better water distribution and slowing down the deforestation from the ground, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The city of Geisa in the Thüring Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
This Saturday and Sunday with a medieval party.
Kramers, sunny, traders, wagons or a land-slave camp should be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crimes, corrupt officials and non-stop drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office who were the target of a granate attack in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal sensations are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the paylist of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest break from violence, and while the bodies go out throughout the country, there are more and more journalists there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the façade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, show his typical T-shirts, or his smiling face.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, alpine dreams, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crimes every year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to court.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are inconsistent and the land is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to discuss security, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he said.
As long as we don't know why, we're all disbelieved."
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper’s office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot 12 times on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve Rivers".
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
News tends to fly freely to Culiacan.
But about Valdez, there is almost nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his release to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot every day on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey maussoles for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes to the United States.
However, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was blamed for unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
In February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have irritated the sons, suspected gang members purchased every copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosk.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the capture of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to carry out journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for brave and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked to be able to publish hard-touch investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else was afraid to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the "International Press Freedom Award" of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage to pursue the Mexican drug history, wherever she leads.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the fools.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a harbourer, the friend who was generous with humility and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust their routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his destruction?
Her death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how they can best do their work and survive.
"They don't like to engage with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start-up and landings" to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censure and self-conservation.
Trust in his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "a smell of a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - not as much as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lurative fraud, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. Days before it was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers that the governor himself considered unreliable.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
The murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state expenditure focused on the hometown of the Governor.
And there was a group who conducted a dismissal in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the Governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this room, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman occurred a military attack.
Just a few months ago, the readers saw the column of Valdez as the most informed source of dismissal.
"We had already known what happened," Villarreal, 46, said, with the top name "El Flaco" because of his slim body status.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been converted into a storage room for signs and labels protesting against the murder of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the Western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its own.
Journalists throughout the country have become more voiced by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
This day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and attempts to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked her to be divided again by the government because she is worried that her anger has injured her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "close" to organized crimes, government officials involved and an equivalent society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug bands, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were under a roof.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a scary effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cardle: "I'm here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana did by Nuevo Laredo after the killing of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug card with a guide article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it appears to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain back and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
“Mexico goes to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was over, Riodoce’s editors sat on the street in front of the office and drank beer when all of their phones began to sum up.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the Badeon Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassys in the region.
From the edge of the board they have published the news on Riodoce’s website via mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen lighted up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police who kept watching to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they did not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the entire Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed his traces.
“How can you just think about it,” Bojorquez said, “if the same day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting.”
Dinosaurs used tarning to escape his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although a terrifying.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they even could find that his shit skin was red-brown - and they said she had had something of a "unquiet past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-powered dinozaur ever found, and one of the best dinozaur copies in the world."
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the crew between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well received state has been amazed by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the panned plant feeder is the best-reserved fossil of its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock on the spot, and decided to see more accurately.
The Fossil that he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within £2,500 heavy earthquakes.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you just shine a little bit with your eyes, you might almost believe that it’s been sleeping,” chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, said.
“It will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs exemplars – the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
Researchers have found that this plant feeder, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking tank, is likely to be threatened by dinosaurs eating meat.
The strongly panned dinosaur used a red and white turtles to hide from smoking animals, and used a protective technique known as countervaluation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to mix better into its surroundings and escape its enemies, experts say, indicating it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurians has made the first hit titles in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli, according to museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the exemplary enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and weapons over his body.
They discovered the concussion, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although concussions are common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is far beyond that of the animals currently living.
It indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted by the meat-freeze dinosaur of sufficient pressure, that the evolution has favored the degradation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use concussion - think of rows, zebras or curtains - are much smaller and more vulnerable than beasts, which signals that this nodosaurier had been exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Powerful robbery behaviour on a massive, strongly-panned dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur robbery of the crew era had been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what he had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, went into a river and was driven out to the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea ground.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved shameful skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early crew times.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to rebuild it. If you just shake a little with your eyes, you might almost believe he’s sleeping.”
The crew era was a time when huge theropods, meat-free dinosaurs standing on two legs, passed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the sponsored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta has been mumified in the sea after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was grub on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-paced dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from the sneeze to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-length tops that climbed from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the tanked plant feeder was flooded by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.
But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur retained his arms in exquisite detail.
The stoned residues of this special exemplary are so well received that the others still cover holprix tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as strange as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it is.
Stoneed residues of the skin still cover the hollow tanks that wear the shell of the animal.
His right front leg lies at his side, his five fingers are stretched upwards.
I can count the shoes on his soil."
In the wind: A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Knap 30 vehicles are engaged in a mass crash.
There are many injured, kilometre-long stain and gaffer.
On the highway Stuttgart-München (A8) late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass crash.
According to the first police reports, at 17.00 p.m. between the connecting stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a windstorm nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks.
The exact number of injureds was not available at first.
It’s about mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large offer of rescue vehicles was at the scene.
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich there was a 10-kilometer-long backdrop.
As reported by an AZ reporter, it also came to massive disabilities on the roadway - through numerous gaffers.
The firefighter noted the characteristics of the vehicle wheels that are now expected to be sensitive to punishment.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a truck.
A rescue driver was on his way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing hard is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep into your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
If the shepherd comes and wakes up an unsafe or pushes the passenger out of the workflow.
Passenger check.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the unfair check-in.
You can simply confirm by phone that you take your place and devalue your ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
"When the offer comes, we will extend it.
It will then be expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other remote routes in Germany,” a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the devaluation of the ticket without sheepfner.
To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you need to have booked an online ticket – what the majority of passengers do.
It is also necessary to use the app of the train that you have purchased the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: You rise in the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.
The train drivers receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the Y-booked seat.
When the train manager arrives at Y place, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.
"Whoever wants to travel without ticket control by our train escort staff simply check in at the DB Navigator itself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Office of DB Remote Traffic.
Second Plus: “And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs.”
Those who frequently drive the train know that besides delays and missing trains, the checks of tickets are among the biggest troubles.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets.
Or the credit card or personal certificate is missing, or any other document you need to submit.
The consequences are endless discussions between train drivers and passengers, which lead to poor mood in the department or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets, and the craftsman ends up taking the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that’s only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Eden.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet released.
As an activist learned the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot up to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, she sat in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled via Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
“The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it’s still on the street,” he said.
As nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone off to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, who wearing a shield entitled, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer secured his gun and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder we have used to and we can typically call it.”
At that moment I felt a whistle-free.
I was angry and wept.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinema from 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter weared a flower dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “over the black experience and the black state”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" she recalls what she said.
“We are going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn’t take them,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
You need to know it and see it and be raised in it.
She must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience eclatant racism, she is not different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I would give her a bad service to keep her away.”
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place against the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags before and helped to distribute them to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activism began to adopt for Ferrell’s shape.
"My activism has changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequality in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came in the sense of Ferrell: “Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?”
This scepticism was fed by countless cases by people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not concentrated their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-register Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism for deceased arrests.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We're talking," Davis said.
“This was the main thing for me how these people will be presented, because that is how I will be presented.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that meets," Folayan said.
As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the humanization of black people must have some vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, featured the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity.
"She was the person who irritated this energy," she said.
“It’s not an accident, although she was on the front, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is on the game so much.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on trial for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she clings to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "Drum" to "Greatness": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg".
While one says to the bit gallery, "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really good" (Nicole Schausten), it comes from the other side, "Don't use a man" (Siggi Beets) or simply: "Greatness!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed.
The gallery is planned on the grounds on which the farm market hall is standing, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will end.
The gallerymakers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - that is, to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: “We have been buying nearly a week in the farm market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the ladies are always very pleased.
We have also discovered the meats for ourselves.
We would like to have a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is also.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Of direct marketers sit in a market hall at the gallery, they are on the level of rent.
This may not be low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why Shopping Halls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find that excessive.
There is enough in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular week market, it is more important that at least we remain the market hall.
Because, in any case, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not portable for a retail.
Shame, special shops are almost no longer, and what remains of them is probably going to disappear."
Wolf Fandel: “A shopping center with a market hall doesn’t fit me.
The gallery does not fit Bitburg.
First of all, where should the farm market go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie have already been able to distribute all the stores from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn't need anyone.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farm market rather than this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, yes, thanks to the crazy many - as I find it - no more meaningless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farm market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost insignificantly the same - which hang on the cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tubber and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the exit from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst committed a 35-year imprisonment after making secretly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks' website.
The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfraud and disident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, although some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations also creates.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a cirnic, black-white selfie, in which Manning was apparently unwanted sitting on a driver’s seat and carrying a platinum-blonde perücke - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stains and cotton by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of how these people could look.
That was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press release at the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and couldn't be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her detained museum became inequalities of letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, demanding Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a kind of welcome meeting.
There is also now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is warning against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, twitter ways to further deflate the stricter divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird time of all of these things, she said that "diges are happening for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her overwhelming signature (which "i" in her family name is equipped with a heart), demanded the end of "automatic destruction, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in bottled.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 videowork, Spurious Memories, also said.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition stored in a private room is a page from the above-mentioned comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free phone in the hand from the U.S. disciplines like King Song.
“If they cool your speech, they won,” he says.
"Never stop your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I'm still going to get skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should be done, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacres that combine like Hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Stature), where their genetic haplo groups were written with flask.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," Dewey-Hagborg said.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her release.”
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University searched for murder
A nationwide human hunt is in gang for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is searched for as suspects after a man was shot in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by the Cook County Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system published by the Chicago police said the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries in his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event, and detectives investigated the case as a murder while police actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now awarded and was excluded from the entry of the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case that is investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help U.S. investigative authorities in any memorable way."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he urged the suspects to stand against the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities would help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said something had happened in an apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management team published a statement to the residents: “The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible home accident.”
"We will complete the WADA road plan in the near future" - Russian Vice-Premier Mutko
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented to restore the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA schedule was updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for RUSADA re-implementation and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria listed on the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the results of the investigations reported by WADA by Canadian attorney Richard McLaren allegedly state-sponsored dopings in Russian sports.
With regard to the issue, Mutko said: “We conduct the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist.”
Mutko's words agreed with the words of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping committee.
Speaking with the Russian sales site RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one will accept this report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the conduct of doping controls in Russia during the doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reused.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was reported by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it could be further deducted from no health impairment, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronyl-containing anti-lubricants.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your employees in your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was never consistency and objective,” said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called for help from outside.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hosting, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to exercise the C-Suite management managers directly.
“They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company,” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees thought and felt won with glint in the three years.
In addition to Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can follow why.
Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you don’t become the next Uber involved in Scandinavia since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of disturbances in which those who have spoken were punished.
For startups like Glint, this wish is a lucky business opportunity for an overview.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in Uber Falls in miscredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made "plus" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problems areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the main business manager is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The public opinion court has collected regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treated badly or misconducted by its employees, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their business centers.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email to the company center, to file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company uses Convercent, problems previously hidden by managers sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, torture or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience," Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee commitments seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty washing from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only bets.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work you do deserves, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well. Businesses are running well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise third parties to increase engagement and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee commitment according to experts in the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow employees will ask yourself, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And if you don't care about it, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to start action on the same day when a glint problem is reported, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights on its employees, and it hopes that in the long term it will lead to a better binding of employees in a industry known for its high revenue.
“If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It is about 23 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are engaged on one side of the team’s new fields of exercise on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotober parts and show the back full of welding from the first day of the training.
For a good part of the team, these unemployed minutes are a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of exercise before returning to Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"That's a real treadmill for the boys in the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the already completed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the breasts moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times of practice in Westwood.
They will hold exercises during August 18, 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA regulation change, even if it added another point to the players’ multi-employed routes.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
“And they just pushed it, they push up, they’re great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which, in the light of the clear views of its fields from a neighbouring parking lot and the neighbouring Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper-class that has already been thrown with footballs, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora stated that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“It’s a real problem, and it’s not a long way to think that people rent a room there and then start to register an exercise.
If you have the video band from an exercise, it is a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in combating fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to third-party fact checkers and then show their results under the original contribution, the world’s largest online social network said Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible fake messages and send them to fact checkers who may show the results of the fact verification from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where French voters were flooded with false stories before the presidential election in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media if they fail to eliminate hateful posts as before the elections in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German statement that a new fact review test will be launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
“In addition to knowing what stories of third-party fact checkers are discussed, people want to make more contexts to make detailed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "connected article" and work on other changes to his message feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a flower for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seats in Bewl River Valley in Kent and now becomes the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopharyntic Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
“I think it’s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has died for 300 years,” he said.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he unexpectedly found emotional.
“I just reacted to the damprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he said.
"That's his smoke print!
And letters always smell to smoke, for at that time a fire was burned for light.
For a person who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there too.
I love the archive!"
For someone who has been beaten with so old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overvalued my welcome base"), it seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyanine heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tomb.
He walked through the landscape and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and started writing.
Scotney's intimate story is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive that he described as "a great deal of years when aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the rooftops."
Dailys, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who possessed what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a bird that fought for the two families.
"You guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to get into English history on a broader basis, including The Labourer, followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's uprising of 1381.
“There is a recording of a riot that appeared in the castle in 1380 in this book entitled ‘Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex’,” Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected to each other?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the history of the Jesuit father, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell is presented, who insinuated his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery that was only made years later when his sarg was buried).
The Darrells are the favorite of Scotney's Rhodes' family: "The men seemed to be pretty gauner, making debts again and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to promote joints."
After the end of his introduction to the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has left behind a two-week stay in the Finnish desert for a comic romance about Elämänmäki, the landscape of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been rerequired by nature since.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he said.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish my fucking life again."
Campaign Started: Over 300 Years Old Marien Capsule Covered in Rhöndorf
With the fulfillment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof mark (Roundview of Thursday).
By Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a top point of the campaign.
"That's nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action asked on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't think that (of course!) really," they write on their yesterday unlocked website.
“But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In essence, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city.”
In the action, it is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it is said.
"It is necessary to formulate a lonely promise, one that gives the city an unchangeable self-determination feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof mark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
In Ankara, the Supreme Military Rate (YAS) advises on pensions and transports in the Officer Corps at the beginning of August each year.
That's the same this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish army one year after the attempt.
The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the headquarters of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents and Ministers of Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations under the Chairmanship of the Government.
Thus, the civilians in YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the vessels in the military.
General Staff Chief Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy were suspended.
Since the missing coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army rows – mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan views as the head of the punishment attempt.
Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the puppet attempt, negotiations will be made in Ankara since this week.
Earlier on the day after the punishment, Erdogan had called the revolt attempt "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the army forces".
But is Erdogan really in charge of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Inconvenience in the Military Headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "islamization" of the army, which is manifested, among other things, in the revocation of the ban on the head-touch for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the great purity of the army and security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan fired by a decree of 7395 other state servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had defeated the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real lords of the country.
Three times they put their role as a guardian of the world government.
After his 2002 election victory, Erdogan pushed the military's power step by step, not last with reference to the European Union's reform plans.
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the Armed Forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-named officer warned, after attempting to seek fear of persecution abroad asylum, that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such development could not make NATO cold.
Without a doubt, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational abilities are “deficient,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.
It plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and family-oriented visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. citizens from other countries are spending green cards.”
The law will prevent chain immigration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to sanate the race steigshuttle route
Over the past few months, it has always been arguing about the future of the race steigshuttle - now it's going to go very fast.
Even before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the Maroden route on which the tourist trail runs.
In order to ensure the future of the race steigshuttle in the long term, construction work is to be started this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and sanating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, particularly important to tourism," said traffic secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of maintaining the route was approximately 2.5 million euros.
From this amount, the country takes 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future by the country, is currently finally voted, Sühl said.
The ministry and the Souththüringen Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This means that the schedule, used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated,” Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years.
In order to order the race-steign shuttle regularly in December 2017.
Racingsteig-Shuttle is a racing connection mostly popular among tourists between the Ilmenau train stations and Racingsteig.
Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also strongly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn’t be even crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big thing right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breastplate and the type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we'll get them even more frequently," Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex puppies have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone leather that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also adapt his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the robot’s eye color to the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressively.
Modern sex puppies have developed into robots with a silicone leather.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find attractive, such as scaryness.
And then there are still the Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of horror and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is customized to your personality as well as possible,” True Companion’s website swears.
So she likes what she likes, and she doesn't like what she doesn't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in the mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjective female properties that claims to rape, when you move a step on Frigid (heating here: contradictory) Farrah, worried one most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?"
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture.
But what goes through the random areas can be very teachingful in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
However, there is a certain surrender that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide when there is a president in the White House who has spoken about sexual assault.
The most terrifying aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic pictures, the excavated bodies and the excavated eyes, but how realistic this vision is.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to real women as realistic as possible (even with pornstar ratios).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.
You can’t separate yourself from your companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are favored slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017:
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney an inclusion of the healthy human mind
It has become a twin whiteness of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized U.S. currency have also divided families in small format.
About Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with Trump’s horror-election relatives.
We allegedly strictly urge all of us to put our filter bubbles.
Less noted is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relative she has struggled for decades for politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
For the meal, this is certainly a good thing, but I find it in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the deterrent effect of his presidency has the power to shoot us all right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his wives will no longer be deprived of us one day.
However, there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the Republican of the right wing, which suddenly appears as an inclusion of reasoning compared to his standards.
Today, I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which both occurred in fact as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must be mentally healthy to qualify for an inevitable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussel in Central Park, the largest carussel in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are crushed and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and climbing music transmits this in a strange way.
So many cliches of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become too old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty years later, and I’m still not quite away from the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually no Swiss Cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not – but a large circular traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carrussel is still a strange magical experience, since here two two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the carussel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked about it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to assess my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compensate the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the store table.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the shop stood laughing at me while I was tired to give her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his shoulders, which the prison authorities said he suffered after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after a prosecutor's appeal against a first murder sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early mornings of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nightmare who hid himself in the cabin.
Attorneys have announced their intention to file this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too careful.
The national law enforcement authority said it would be appealed to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the feathers from Fütze and Epfenhofen were released into holidays and further schools.
Three of the graduates will go to the high school in the future, four to the real school.
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Civil House in Epfenhofen.
As a symbol for the school release, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chosen a young man who grows up in the chicken garden, but then will be released into freedom.
To do this, the muntere shar led a musical titled "The Adler in the chickenhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it go out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken cow, a small cow came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, and the ashes spread their wings on a high mountain, and fled.
Then the three and four classes showed a poultry dance in Yvonne Frank's study.
The hens danced with the young gobbles wearing cylinders to the bets.
The adler stands for integration, school manager Angelika Sitte said.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals, it belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted to be accepted in her new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who is repeatedly entering in teaching passports, and the parents' representatives.
The puppy time is over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She released her students after two years of lesson just very tired, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they could rely on the fireplaces.
Finally, all students made a song of summer time and holidays.
The children had great joy.
For the new year of school, there are already eight first candidates.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campsites in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported by television.
In the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal people, including the two Bulgarians, in Sithonia.
The same day they were released, while an investigation is currently underway.
The foreign ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have intensified control over the free camp and put significant fines on anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What the affected needs to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should diesel drivers participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They aim to improve the emissions behaviour of cars Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europa gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The binding updates previously apply only to vehicles that have soft software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their re-equipment has been arranged by the Federal of Electricity (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months, but have not specified a precise date yet.
Daimler has notified to write to each person concerned.
If any inspection is subject, it will be done within their framework.
How long should the rearrangement take place in total?
"Too hard to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers, as well as on political pressure.
“Because we’ve seen, car manufacturers don’t act voluntarily at the environmental issue so far.”
How long does the update take?
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time-consuming to get a date.
What do drivers who do not drive from BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign producers would be attracted, according to Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
In the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there is no value loss for older diesel so far.
The ACE advises you to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center awards
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizes won’t come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to be one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural facility announced Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreography Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will arrange a reception and participate in the conspiracy together with his wife Melania.
Lear, award-winning winner of progressive TV series, has already announced to resign from participating in the Gala.
The New York Times said: “This presidency has decided to completely ignore the arts and human rights – even to withdraw them from the resources – and that loads me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify its views.
The Kennedy Center named after former President John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural facility in the U.S. capital.
The previous prize winner include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city baumeister, will retire next year.
The job has already been written, but suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city baumeister.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he said in the press talk.
He reports varied, but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular termination periods, it should still be enough time for a review.
Since Haslach serves as the underlying building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must submit appropriate degrees.
This function will certainly preserve the city.
If they could no longer fill it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg to consult.
But citizens are close to the city and to him themselves, says Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate as well as a good mood between government and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered, looking back to the Wackers with pride.
“We make the city worth living,” he is safe through the building office and his employees.
But also in the future there are a variety of projects on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla area and the lowerparkplatz have been raised, for example.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium rehabilitation is still a topic.
Only the latter will beat books with about €1.5 million, "if we're doing it right," estimates Wacker.
"Everything in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
Guests are available for a city builder with a large playroom.
With Haslach’s own building and gardenery, it can be quite flexible to respond to many.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city is an ensemble of monumental protection, it is important to have an eye for what is in mind, when new buildings are approved, the separating city builder stresses.
Without it, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's the builder, "at the end, everything runs over my table."
In maintenance and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his successor remains for a long time, Wacker wishes: “We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place.”
Continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a complete study as a graduate engineer or bachelor with specialized architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The city building is subject to high and deep construction, construction planning, ground commercial affairs, management of urban properties, urban exploitationhof with bouwhof and urban gardennerei as well as under construction law authority including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on guides: South track shut down
According to police, the unknown criminals had thrown the blue bike from the railroad transfer in the area of Leobener Street (B116) to the directions.
These were so severely damaged that the upcoming goods train had to be stopped.
The investigators go out of two male kidnappers and search for them for the night.
Near the attack were observed by witnesses a pink roller and a bike driver.
"This goes far beyond a lausbus," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The person or the criminals had put themselves in great danger and also threatened the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the lock and the facility, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail-replacement traffic, the railroad customers could also have been able to charge the offenders.
Overall, it's about to get out of a "social" sum, said the spokesman.
The damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the southern railway track could be carried out without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains were displaced on Friday morning, two of which were related to distance traffic.
Trucks did not fall, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, approximately 200 meters of upper lines had to be exchanged.
Insulaters and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory gut disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alp dream for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealthy state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach crashes and swellings, repeated or bloody strokes, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid triptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory intestinal disorder.
Experiments have found that a kind of immune cells that promote tolerance occur in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intakes.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophans had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a triptophan-rich diet promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment when the same system works in humans as well.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, had not been.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbies of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse's dermas were DNA sequenced and six bacteria species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they missed a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how bacteria influenced the immune system, the researchers L. reuteried in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unmatured immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleansed from the liquid, it has been shown to be a by-product of the triptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50%, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
"The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "geny" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "geny" with Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signed started with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last predecessor game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced in their desires.
However, Matic was excluded from the Blues preparation tournament and only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
“He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him to be ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-up XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already made a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the association for it," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve made great effort.”
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US State of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole was a durable test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertisements.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New deep hit for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of SPD, social-democratic Prime Ministers were always looking at Berlin before the elections with some concern.
Just no fire from the party central, just no wind from the federation - so was the most important desire of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been increasingly excited about the events in the SPD-led country capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
They were deep attacks.
And one after the other.
According to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows again: Red Green can simply not govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the German Redaction Network (RND).
The surprise of a Green Deputy’s group’s emergence has fallen into a severe crisis by Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD).
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green-Bundes Director Michael Kellner has called for the abrupt Low-Chassis Green-Deputy Elke Twesten to resign their mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear misconception of voting will.
Every Twesten must immediately return its mandate,” said the Federal Business Director and Electoral Leader of the Greens to the German Redaktions Network (RND).
"That must not be true at all," said a SPD election warrior, when the new message reached the central party on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the Green Members' transition to the CDU without their own government majority.
It is the provisional point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misers began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no longer, was calm in its time.
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
That’s what happened – and that’s what became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite high the party smoothly.
The prisoners re-recorded in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit in Hamburg arrived.
And with him came the next deep strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country chief, lost his nibus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphil Harmony while his city burned.
And because he was doing so much wrong in crisis communication afterwards that he could do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has fought for his political survival.
And now also Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW’s gas affair and its role in the supervisory board, the Lower Chase Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Miese surveys were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just for this reason, because in the past few weeks he has tried to put more and more accents in the union.
The effort of the former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to give it because they promised a stabilization of the party.
Now, the exact opposite could happen.
This is because there is no fault in the party's internal conflict with the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't at all.
Sometimes the companions try to keep their own rows closed.
Their anger is focused on the greens, and above all on the disgusting parliamentary twist.
"It is intolerant and democratically harmful how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, Head of Party Links at the SPD Federation Group, the Redaction Network Germany (RND).
Ms. Twesten was elected to Parliament, not because of her personality as a direct candidate, but because of the country's list of the Lower Chase Greens, according to the Lower Chase Deputy.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Federal Day Fraction, complains of a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voter role was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Chase SPD as a top candidate to the federal election, says the RND.
"Now, the personal career memory of a future CDU deputy falses the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CDU Lower Axis.
Funds for Ortskern III
Anyone who wants to regain his home in the years will soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three STEG City Development representatives were informed on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991, it has been in refining areas.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funds.
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant remained 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, not only new building areas.
On April 4, the Government presidency Karlsruhe received information that there will be a restoration area III.
The funds amounted to 833,333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest of the municipality Empfingen.
How does a sanitation area emerge?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to rehabilitate whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
If appropriate, the borders of the area could move again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal country programme "Social City", in the context of which the restorations would then be carried out.
The keys of the programme are the revitalization of internal cities, the improvement of housing and employment conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in respect of objects, that is, per piece of land.
The restoration area would eventually be set as a statute.
The authorisation period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the stock recording will only be carried out, within which the parties in the area of rehabilitation will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutory decision is to be made as far as possible so that the recovery can be started next year.
Pietzschmann later explained that each municipality should carry out the claimed pre-checks.
It is about assessing urban failures and deciding when and to what extent it is restored.
There is also a declaration of restoration for the respective property in the basic book.
Pietzschmann himself will come again after feelings and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "build and land bowl", which is amongst other things about the construction condition and the restoration intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "business and housing box", information on the size, distribution and residents of a residential area can be made.
The blue "operative bow" is only filling if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel noted that a filling questionnaire is not an application for grants at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler further emphasized that the distribution of the funds according to the "Wind Dog Principle" works - whoever comes first eats first.
You can't "reserve" funds for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Locskern II" were shown to make the attendees a "tasteful" sanitation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in home and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his home door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between dumm and show fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesisist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, everything for an expense of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and at its BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the control.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a marine hub to South Lawn for an event that emphasizes U.S. manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers, according to the military’s statements left to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the White House’s leading officials made a round of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was released next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi clutch.
The White House’s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility,” the commander of the HMX-1 wrote at the evening of the event to his chairman, the deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 a.m., and remained so long until the grass was spaced between 18 a.m. and 21 a.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours, a second crew would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained at the plane during the time.
It was not clear from the records provided by the TIME whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Datasets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could infringe the determination.
“A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're locked," the Deputy Commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political captains.
At the event, the President encouraged the reform of the health reform in the Senate, and promoted efforts to comply with government regulations.
Use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the presidential plane carried out taxi services at the back of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 countries made by American workers with American materials," said White House's Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop U.S. Presidents in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the month's flight crew, said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "Non-Presidential Support Missions".
The White House said the taxpayers had taken the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A spokesman from Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per flight hour.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
“Determining the costs for taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract termination.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security, and I guess hundreds of thousands of people are not dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked untiredly.
Of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his runway over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the headquarters of a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and laughed at the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of a kniffled task
The top rider of the Second Tennis League joins the Searchdorfer SV tablendritte.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive tomorrow at 11:00 p.m. in Kiel at the tablendritt Searchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches, the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
Team Chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar forms.
Just at the rear positions I think the team is very good.”
For class and stability at searchdorfer SV, imports from high northern are mainly provided.
“The Danish and Finnish can even refer to betting in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," Zay says, looking at Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“It’s going to be difficult for us, as always.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The newest team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If at the Challenger tournament in Italian Biella the French are not active at the Bundesliga party at the moment, Zdenek Kolar, who plays at the Czech Liberec tournament, comes to his first bet in this season.
Undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was with Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday.
However, he should be similar in Kiel to Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
Not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary who was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, somebody from the coach team around Marius Zay fills the frame.
How America Can Harm the OMV
Truly, Donald Trump did not seem lucky when he put his signature under the law on the reinforcement of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In his will to adopt the law," the Congress has packed into a few "constitutional laws", he said.
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shameed against the U.S. attack.
Finally, the draft proposes to punish European companies to help Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV have been concerned since co-financing the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 East Seas with other European companies.
The threats are enormous.
However, it is too early for an assessment of the impact, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself has to raise the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve guns are chosen for him.
"The press" has looked at what the group could deviate and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be hit by Netflix in the middle of the series
Despite Narcos’ second season revealed by Pablo Escobar’s killer, Netflix’s series has not been over for a long time.
The three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the richest drug trade organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Leadered by four powerful patents, they operate "as a Fortune 500 companies" only with more state strikes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) defeats the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Steel-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role back: The city introduces 46 kitchen assistants
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With solid contact partners for children and an assignment to the team.
The clock will be returned to the city's children's day places.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will resume the food supplies in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas) back to its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Chief of Youth Help, this is a good news: "We've all been very pleased."
It is still cooked outside of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooled cooked.
The city operates 46 children’s dayplaces in Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2,800 children were sitting at the table, and the needs are growing constantly.
“Now not only eat children who are taken care of for 45 hours a week in the Kita to lunch,” Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay up to 14:00."
46 part-time personnel have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the dishes made of meals, supplement them around salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meals individually, spend the meal, clean up, wash and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a Kita,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-groups as well as seven-groups - decides about the range of hours.
“The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team,” says Pommeranz satisfied.
“So they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for guitaring.”
This is also about healthy diet and cooking lessons.
“Children should help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen to the team is meaningful.
Also for the children.
“They have a known force in Kita, a person who is trusted to them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - as well as the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance, the charm that it has shown to be the most economical in comparison with the cost of self-religiousness and foreign affairs for the city, the press office says.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-established.
“But these hours in about 750 people in the educational area are not so heavy,” says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, the UN mission chief in Afghanistan said Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, official head of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be nominated for the council elections in the provinces. Three women are nominated for the role of Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible when women are fully involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Province Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to a election process that coincide with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role.
This year, the elections for the first time will be peacefully transferred from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will continue to strengthen Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of 3.6 million voters have been registered.

Men try to get 13-year-old girl out
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are supposed to have attempted to beat a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the 13-year-old men who were staying with friends on the Kolping Street talked about at 14.55 because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with his friends.
Then one of the criminals tried to catch the girl's phone and necklace, but it failed.
The duo fled without a beat.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to ensure with managers of McVitie’s biscuit manufacturer the long-term commitment to production in its work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had changed about the future of investments in Tollcross.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cakes alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade unions would "experience as the first" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie’s urged "to express concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be driven".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affected by our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour forces are strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow Space, an important pillar for human-decent employment in a region with high unemployment and social protection.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the rising living costs and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a growing production presence at McVitie.
A spokeswoman of Pladis said: “The branch at Tollcross has only received yesterday a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with our employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we will continue to review our businesses - and that is true for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’ legacy as a production site. If our operational processes change at the site, employees and their trade representatives will be the first to learn this.”
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verrati
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in Neymar's persecution after she has issued a £ 189 million offer to launch its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record crash?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window in the summer because the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89 million last season.
After the ending, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's high-paid professional athlete. PSG offers more than £500,000 salary per week.
Barcelona is angry with the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan government is that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the world of football warned three years ago by the PSG President from this perspective?
When Manchester City 2014 showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
“I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, this will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG clearly stated that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its pricing offers for Neymar.
Roller wrapped and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown criminal deliberately threw a roller shut down on the royal fielder street before the property number 30 and thus imposed Sachs damage to the vehicle’s coverage of more than 200 euros.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his track, the driver had to escape from a VW Touran and touched the board.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 19:55 at the B 215 from Stolzenau was travelling towards Leese.
In the area of the local settlement of Stolzenau, a truck met him on his track, so he had to escape to the right.
The Touran driver touched the board.
The car has been damaged.
The driver of the opposite truck, a Mercedes Benz, had overcome a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the accident.
According to the accident, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the causer vehicle to contact the Commissioner at Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report dismissed by Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse dismissed Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the Reform Movement "We are Church", said after publication to the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domcallmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets of their own discomforts or their false appreciation of the events at that time.
On the contrary, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the reporting of violence in the Domspace will be measured with "second degree".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is a "shameful and shameful" act that should be punished and prevented in the future; but it should be noticeable to the "grade of media manipulation", according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the Italian National Bioethic Committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian broadcast: “You like to go to the church and that’s a found dish.”
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beating has been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be ready with dishes like one I was."
It seemed unfair to apply today's standards to the past decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Fully injustice, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in custody," Hesemann says, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he estimates the results of the final report.
What is precisely stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg with the enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were victims of crimes, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, said: “Together, it can be concluded that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R..
Just with high emotionality, the punishment for students could also seem harder.
However, unlike many other accused, it appears that many victims appreciated R.’s general humanity and therefore in many cases even link positive memories to it despite violence.”
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was dismissed in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "accidents of violence practices on defendants at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
To one end, many students highlight their “humanity”.
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who has often become handmade when a Domspatz musically did not bring top performance.
How do you evaluate this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you do the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.
He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly disclosed by any suspicion of mediator or co-consciousness in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Excess of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of action.
You can either claim to have experienced too late or not taken the first statements seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was found by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "rescue", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes him as a "warm-hearted", "popular", "reliant", "competent" and "comprehensible" as a extremely kind teacher who was the boys regularly cared for with cakes, cakes and bonbons and "always cared for" grapes from children.
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which even once led to rage breaks.
The fact that he not only knocked with chairs and threw the keyboard on the ground, but also distributed ears and pulled too freak boys on his hair or ears, he admitted himself, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, for his honour, it is necessary to say that such educational methods were widely used in the controversial times, in the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you also know such swelling methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this at a world school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what the report actually refers to, that is, the abuse of sexual abuse and the abuse of violence in the preschool, it is freely Baghdad.
It is already questioned whether it has to do with his familiarity and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him.
Many people who have never understood him are still eager to work on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report is dismissed by Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report about abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also be charged with any misconception or co-consciousness regarding sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Domkapell Master.
Even the parents were not consecrated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said a deputy member for the others, "It was all very sad to me."
The real problem in the detection of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent from shame.
If they don’t even trust parents and brothers, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been professionally a colleague of the offenders.
How do Domspatzen students assess the role of Ratzingers in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student said: “As to sexual abuse, I don’t see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have stopped the offender.
I think it is also really absurd to assume that it has been calculated for him... bubbles more intriguing or even more clear or more open than for their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report concludes the very clear conclusion: "It was not possible to confirm the fact that students who had previously affected him and/or their surroundings could not be trusted in the context of the investigation."
As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is to free from any co-consciousness.
Thus, he cannot be accused of preventing him or bringing him to the public.
Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name to these contradictory crimes, as did in some cases unfortunately.
There was a lot of "violence" in the media at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Former Domkapell champion Georg Ratzinger is rejected in the report "Weshow".
Does he have to live with this claim?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that’s exactly what the report has been abused.
There is a clear distinction between the preschool and the gym of the Domspats, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say, other charges.
The report also addresses incidents from 1945, and also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domspatzen.
All the horrific pedagogy, the cases in which boys were regularly scattered and painted by Sadist teachers and undertook detrimental pain, all of them occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where they had to have really had scandalous conditions.
But with them, Domkapell Master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, because he got the boys to see only when they were already at the Domkapell Gymnasium.
It was, as most witnesses emphasized, the theme "Prior School" tabu.
You were just happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengennasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no Sadist violence.
And that is true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "a lot of victims appreciated R.'s general humanity and therefore in many cases even link positive memories to it despite violence".
The most important thing is to have a look away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the state of the preschool.
The first time he began to establish himself in 1970/71 and from the processes at a school where he did not work and was responsible, he didn’t want to hear anything (that’s the Witness) and then again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close the ears consistently before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz Gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this, he pointed out that "the penalty will continue to be exercised in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent entry.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as prosecution penalties were forbidden in Bavaria for a long time.
Before that, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps overwhelmed or dramatized and where the permitted boundary had actually been exceeded.
You can't even say he'd always look away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 the punishment was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fallstrick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse which was abrupt at all times, nor to what was broken in the preschool of opposition and violence to innocent children, which is already far beyond the ordinary at that time.
It's all awful and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
Its means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly observed it.
What picture of his Regensburger’s time, then, has Georg Ratzinger released in conversations with you for the book “My brother of the Pope”?
Was the subject of the penalty also to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the dogs played only one sideroll.
However, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the requirement of essential discipline, it would probably have been hardly possible to form a world-class institution of the well-known Regensburg Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you are making no big singers and face any success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-survival.
What kind of person have you experienced by Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have actually met Georg Ratzinger very well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing, and heart-hearted people from whom you can’t imagine that he could also do something wrong with a plane.
I regularly get with how many former Domspatzens still today, 23 years after his emerity, keeping in contact with him regularly, visiting him, reading him - he's almost blind - and treating him as a member of his family.
Therefore, those who have not forgiven him until now that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most dogs are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music.
And that he is always a good, parental teacher - a strict father, sure - but he was also a loving respectful person to whom they still look today and worship them straight.
And, again, clearly: all that you claim to him are the educational methods that were at that time on the agenda.
We can be happy to have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is highly unfair, a man just because he is prominent and has even more prominent brother to make a medial sin bow.
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious.
The report, which was just published, has dismissed it.
Now the pledge would require a 93-year-old man who has acquired great gains and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen finally leave in peace.
