Deputy Cromwell's Statue will be the last memorandum in the debate on "transkription of history"
Removal would be poetic justice for his taliban-like destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts of England, carried out by his fanatic, puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposals as "crime" and "an attempt to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, President of Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitably associated with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace of the palace of Westminster at Westminster would become a target.
The Storm Image during the British Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificial for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a testimony of attitudes in the 19th century and a part of the historyography of a figure, which many still think worth honor.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against pressing outstanding, in his case pressing from monarchy monarchy.
Whether it is a precise imagination is subjected to constant historic debate.
"Certainly, what's sure is that conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognized figure representing one side of the battle.
"Son lord Protector's performances, deservit de honor, deservit de memorandum."
Dbergris Attack and Kidnapping China Farmer

The man, identificated only under his poem "Yuan", was found dead with a convulsion of pulse and intrusion of blood near a grizzly on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A farmer of pork prepares for injection of pork with vaccines during a pork use on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China (China).

More than 20 million see the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million witnesses of Thursday from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, allegedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six stations of television.
During the same time, the political struggle with stations, which broke the ordinary programs to tell about the late development of Friday: an agreement made by senator of Arizona Jeff Flake, which permitted FBI to conduct a long week investigation of prosecutors.
Ford told Senate's jurisprudence committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, in a state-of-the-art swallowed, greased her and tried to take her clothes from a high school feast.
Kavanaugh, in a spirituellem declaration, deklarated, that he was 100% convinced of that not happening.
According to Nielsen, 20,4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company recorded average seertals of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No seertals were instantly available from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen normally has difficulties to measure how many people see programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a seertal equivalent to a game under the NFL playoffs or Oscar Awards.

Intereses remained high after hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republicans sent a declaration that he wanted to vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while demonstrators cried to him when he attempted to take a lift to the consultation of the jurisprudence committee.

"You have so much power, and so much women have so much power."
Flake said that his office had sent a declaration, and said before lift closed, that he would like to say more in the hearing of committee.
All the TV stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judge Committee would voted on whether Kavanaugh's nomination would move to a vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only for under convincing that FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated next week, which the Democrats, who are in submission in Senate, had demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with her friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake took his decision.
Flake's election had influence because it was clear that Republicans wouldn't have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has inaugurated FBI investigation of prosecutors against Kavanaugh.

"Fénomenalt" de Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Fenomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
Ignorable and superior expectations of their ascending journey.
Their game style and teams are almost inchanged since their return to the best League, but a lot of honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
There were many heroes.
Anders Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their fingers throughout the battle.
Rangers missed dog inspiration.
They had been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their finals turbulent, just once turbulent, and it's a solide awakening for Rangers, sitting in the middle of the point table.

Kanye West: Rapper change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West converts name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter Saturday, where he wrote: "Wesnet formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has named Ye for a while and used the name as titled of his eighth album, which was published in June.
The change occurs before his appearance in Saturday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaced the songs Ariana Grande in the show, as canceled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
Name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has said earlier that name has religious signification for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used words in the Bible, and in the Bible means 'you'," said West earlier the year, when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
Album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that preferred Love and Brother Love names.
JAY-Z, one of West's former partners, has also shifted between small and large letters and modified whether the binance string is incorporated.

US should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount they spend in research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come, according to different parts of the US Government have given reports about artificial intelligence. However, the US still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to adopt the first place in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be good idea to double the budget of research for artificial Intelligence, since all other countries are so long backwards than USA, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough within AI," Lee.
Duplication of budget could double chances of the next great performance in artificial intelligence achieved in USA, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee publizova "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and is director executive of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies in artificial Intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranked American Othello player, and later became CEO of Microsoft Research and director of Google Department of China.
Lee recognized ex-tech competitions, supported by the US Government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when to come a new competition so that the next visionary can be identified.
“Scientists in the United States often need to work hard to gain bonds from the government,” said Lee.
"It's not China that's throwing the academic leaders, it's the great companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed astronomers from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in imigration policy could also help USA strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that doctors in the field of artificial Intelligence should have automatically offerd work permits.
China State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a common center for artificial intelligence, which should involve partners of industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
La DARPA anunció this month un investimento de $2 trillion in a initiative called AI Next.
NSF currently investe over $ 100 million per year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which is trying to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence, has remained silent for several months.

Labour is no longer a large party.
They are intolerant to those who express their attitudes
Da Momentums activists in my local party voted to cenzure me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I'm only the last one of a number of Labour parlamentari members who have heard that we're not welcome – only because we've given our opinion to know.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, in parliament, received similar treatment, because she took a strong distance from antisemitism.
I'm in my case, the censored went to criticize me, because I was divergent with Jeremy Corbyn.
Relative to the importance of a responsible economic policy, relative to the national security, in Europe, ironically quite similar problem, in which Jeremy disagrease with ex-leaders.
Inviting a meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the majority of my eight years as local parlementary Members, the meetings of Friday evening just like that.
Lamentablement, today's tone of many meetings is not like that, and the promise of "amigos, glaces" politics is much back in the past, if it ever happened.
Ignorable opinions of different opinions in Laboratory are not tolerated, and all opinions are ponderated, whether the leader of the party can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados deputados.
when I say my opinion in public – and really it’s not matter what I say – follow a long string of heavy messages on social media, inviting to opt-out and contradiction of the mediant politics and tell me that I’m not supposed to be a member of Labour.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
In fact, I'm more happy than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me, in general, are political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and fighting love of colleagues, who are overlooked every day with sexism or racism, but still continues to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era politico is how normal abuse has been made.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a culture tolerant.
In fact, however, it is no longer a spatial organization, and with every vote of incredulity or alteration of the rules of selection, the partition becomes smaller.
I've got a lot of advice in the last two years that if I lay on myself and I'm not so arrogant, then I'm 'non able to handle'.
“Not that’s why I went into politics.
"Since 32 years ago, when I was a member of Labour Labour, when I went to school, I was provocated by the negligence of the Thatcher Government of Thatcher, which would have left our classroom in a low condition and put me in order to create better public services for those who are the most needing of it – whether it was a member of the Labour or as a ministry of mayor or as a ministry of government.
“I never hid my politics, ni in the last election.
Nottingham East, nobody could in any way be confused about my political positions and contradictions with the current leadership.

Two late scores may have obtained the final result of drawing a picture not totally real, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this awesome amusement match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
"And now you are the top of the top of the top of the top, and you are the only unmarried team of ten.
Enfin, la defensividad de la afiliación era la misma defensividad de la afiliación de la oportunidad de la mejor explotación de la oportunidad de la casa de la casa, y entrenador Peter Murchie absolutamente tenía derecho a satisfacer.
"Our struggles have been urgentes, and we are still unrestrained, so that we must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose: "Respect to Ayr, they've used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful spark from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card to Scottish team player Rory Hughes, awarded to the game by Warriors, gave Melrose a benefit, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed by a spark.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penal park just before halfway. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there were 17-5 to Ayr's at the pause.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a spark from Baggot, reduced the difference to five.

Functioning Ayr manager Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without subsequent spark after a period of intense pressure.
But the team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score after a line-out score behind the future Ayr cluster.

North Korea says there will be no nuclear equipment, unless they can trust USA
"North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never devastate their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He invited US to observe the promises given during a summit in Singapore among the rival leaders.
His comments were prolonged by the fact that US Prime Minister of State Mike Pompeo appears to face a restart of nuclear diplomacy atmospheric locked over three months after three months after Singapore meeting with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wish flow" to continue sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the war of Korea, will ever bring North Korea in knees.
Washington is persistent against the declaration, as long as Pyongyang has not taken first significant steps towards desarmamentation.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump will want a more summit.
But there is widespread skepsis in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to elimination of an arsenal, which the country is most likely considering as the only thing that can guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month as preparing for a new summit between Kim and Trump.

With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), after delivering the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As a sector educational, which can compile and implemente a customized curriculum, we experience that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela: "If you speak with a man in a language, he understands, he touches his head.
"If you speak with him in his own language, it touches heart."
"It's an important reminder that we can't only hold ourselves to English, when we'll build relationships and trust between peoples from other countries.
We can see the latest results of this year's exam, that language is the highest in statistics with the most persistent exams in independent schools.
In total, 68 % of the studentes who studied foreign language received high rating A.
Data collected by 74 SCIS's Member Schools showed that 72 % of the students were A rating in mandarin, while 72 % of those who studied German, 69 % of those who studied French and 63 % of those who studied Spanish also received A rating in mandarin.
Independent schools in Scotland support for foreign languages as important competences, which children and young people will certainly need in future.
Language is now perceived as a subject-election at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools pensa and other places.
2014, UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills and Skills) concluded that 17 % de la lipstility linguistique de 17 % had among the reasons why employers could not occupe jobs libres.
Por eso, linguistic skills become more and more important than preparing young people for their future career.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career youths choose, they have, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skills like this.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a predecessor to the competitors.
According to a measurement of YouGov of more than 4,000 respondents in Britain in 2013, 75 per cent of the UK couldn’t speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digital percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in teaching language to those who are children today.
When you can speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools in which languages are taught.
Several schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be the most important for Britain when you look forward to 2020, e.g. mandarin or japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scots independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future offers.

Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has demonstrated fighterhead and attempts to keep hope live before Sunday singleduellers
After three unilateral rounds, Saturday's four hundred duels might have been that Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrant momentumpendul is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept in which players believe – notably in competitions like this.
Where would they say that momentum is now?
"Entonces son seis puntos, y ahora son cuatro; y lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea, lo que sea."
Europa, naturally, has the advantage. They are 4 points front, and there are 12 points more to play about.
"As Spieth says, Americans, however, feel that they've suffered a lot of wind in the ships, and there's a lot of encouragement things to focus on, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day and both can be proud with three points of four possibles.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and puts a good example for his teammates.
The loud voices of jubilation became higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important punch, which ensured victory in four duels, although he and Thomas were two matches after two duels.
His put, which assured them the match of Hole 15, was encountered with a similar cried – the kind of cried that shows that he doesn't think the American team is out of the competition yet.
"You only need to find the internal strength and focused on your own fight," Spieth said.
I'm all that players are back now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
Unique players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, without doubt the biggest story of Ryder Cup.
Europa’s amazing, but sympathetic couples have gained four points in four matches, and it appears irrelevant.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way of energy apparently flowing both to and from wild audience, show that it's those that it's the hardest to beat Sunday. And it would definitely be very popular, if a potential European victory will be infested by Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun descends over Le Golf National.
"Every of the saints is identical to each of their horns.
But it's very early to talk about a victory in Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short process against Sergio Garcia, in the morning of the four-person duels, when he formed pairs with Alex Noren.
Un bogey y un bogey y dos double bogeys on the first nine holes engraved Spanish and Swedish down in a cave, who never were near to come out.
Nobody can help you out of your furnace.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to watch close teams due to interactions between couples, tips they give, tips they don't give, and the way strategies can change rapidly.
Europa has played better as a team until now and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the Four hundred duels have also demonstrated that Team USA has been fighting the fight that some, particularly in America, have doubted.
Europe creates lead on 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europa has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the US 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's well-playing duo led the road with two victorys over a difficult Tiger Woods and have scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European Team, who attempted to win the championship they lost on Hazeltine 2 years ago, dominated a neprecisista American team in the fourballs of the morning and won the 3-1 series.
USA rushed more in foursomes. They won four matches, but still back.
Jim Furyk's team will need eight points in 12 single matches Sunday, if they're going to hold the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in turn, and he and Molinari, who together have won the name "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, is just the second couple in Ryder Cup's history, who has won four points in their first four matches.
The broken Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a non-motive Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought during the first two matches Saturday day, had little genial glimpse, but now he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven foursomes and seven in turn.
Justin Rose was well-developed to fourballs of the morning and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and gained a 2-1 sean over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
Independent Europa, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, deputates, de
Three-fold major-winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a hardly fighting 2-1 series over Spain Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It's only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has struggled back after being back with four points before the single matches. Since Furyks currently has a pokal, however, they only have to achieve indefinite only to keep it.

North Korea says they will not decompose unilateral if there's no trust
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told UNHCR Saturday, the UN said that the continued sanctions will strengthen their infidelity to the US, and that the country will not abandon their weapons atomics unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the Organization of the Worldwide that Korea of North Korea has demonstrated "voluntary well-being" in the last year, e.g. by suspending tests atomic and missiles, deviating an area of tests atomic and promising not to develop weapons and technology atomic.
"Maither, we haven't seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Unconfiance in America, there's no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there's no chance that we ourselves take the first steps and decomposing unilaterally."
while Ri reiterate the North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase-separated" approach to nuclear destruction, where North Korea would be rewarded if they would take step-by-step. However, his speech seemed important, since he did not explicitly rejette unilateral destruction, as it was before the case of Pyongyang.
Ri refers to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting president of the United States and a leader of North Korea in Singapore 12 June, where Kim promised to work "nuclear equipment on Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end of Korea War, which came out in 1950-53, but the US has said that Pyongyang would first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also demonstrated resistance to bleeding against striking international sanctions against North Korea.
"United States insiste on 'nuclear equipment first', y expande pressions with sanctions to achieve their purpose by forced and even contradict 'declaration of end of war'", - he added.
"The idea that the sanctions can bring us to our knees is a desired dream among people who don't know who we are.
"Maybe, the problem is that the sanctions continue to consolidate our credibility."
Ri noted plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as US leader highlighted by the UN earlier this week.

Nonetheless, the tone of Ris speech was very different from the last year, where he told the UN General Assembly, that shooting of North Korea missiles against the continent of America was inevitable, after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on suicide mission.
"Last year Trump in UN threatened with " total destruction" of North Korea, but this year, he urged Kim to protest against disruption, but said that there remains much to be done, and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disruption.
Trump affirmed Wednesday, "Trump , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
"Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United Nations, deputy of the Council of Security of the United Nations, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United States, deputy of the United Nations, deputy of the United Nations, deputy."
Since 2006, the Council of Security has unanimously increased the economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri in the sideline during the United Nations General Assembly, and said afterwards, he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare himself for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times throughout the year, but his last tour wasn't good.
"He left Pyongyang in July, and said that there was progress, while North Korea just a few hours after accusing him of imposing "requisites de migration."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if USA took "equivalent steps."
"Kim" said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps" he needed were the security promises given by Trump in Singapore, as well as movements towards normalization of the relationship with Washington.
Students in Harvard take courses to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor's students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to combat the growing macho culture, where you study all night maintained by large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students of the best universities in the world often don't know the first thing to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has conducted the course, which, he believes, is the first of his kind in the USA.
He received the idea of the course after he had studied about the effects of lack of sleep on the learning.
"As the ministry was finished, una girl, who came to me, and said, 'Why do I know this first now, when I am the master?'

The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to the students how good sleep habits can improve both academic and sport performance and even overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of University Health Area, says that the University has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were serious sleep deficiency during the week.
The timelong course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where the students should click on coffee cups, gardins, runs and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how even the performance of sporting is influenced by the lack of sleep, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, the participants hear about how shortness of sleep over a long time increases the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
“Nom, but we think they have the right to know it - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds professor Czeisler.
The pride that's taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on the students have led to the lack of sleep is a growing problem.

Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian, who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, assisted Professor Czeisler last year in organizing the course when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and allowed him to work to make it to a general course throughout the university.
Hopefully, the next will be that all dimitents will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Profesor Czeisler recomandes alumnes alerter, a fin de savoir cuándo de dormir y cuándo de levantar. This can create awareness of the adverse effects of light from the electronic screens, which can rip at the day rhythm and make it easier to fall in sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meaning from Menga reduces Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat offshore, when Dolly Mengas target signify that Steven Gerrard's unconsistent team must take thanks with a defeat 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team of Ibrox was going after their first victory in the outland since the 4-1-trional at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holts team gave Gerrard only another defeat in 18 matches as coach. There are 8 points to Hearts in the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menta rushed 7 minutes before the pause, which uninspired Rangers team couldn't respond.
Rangers now go down on a sixth place, while Livingston go up on a third place after Hibernian with only the target cornea in differentiation.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, since Calum Spence lines should be treated after being hit in head of a cast object, which seemed to come from the outline section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the setting that reached the semifinal of Betfed Cups by toning through Ayr.
Holt rushed the same 11 who barbered a point of Hearts' motion last week, and he would have been glad to see his strong team excited opponents over the course.
Rangers had the ball the best, but Livingston was more efficient.
They should have scored two minutes in the match, when Menga's first release sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but midfielder's attempts were overthrown.
Un frispark in the deep of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defender Alan Lithgow jumped through the backstep.
However, Rangers took control, but played more in hope than the ability of the attack game.
Alfredo Morales, at least, was inadequate, when Judge Steven Thomson submitte Colombian's appeals for penal park, when he and Steven Lawless merged together after a quarterback game.
Rangers managed only two shots of goals in the first half, but former Rangers prosecutor Liam Kelly, the former Rangers prosecutor Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head of shot Lassana Coulibaly and Ovie Coulibaly's head of shots and Ovie Ejarias Ejarias.
Although Lily's opening in the 34th minute was something random, it must be worthy of their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a situation of deathball in the depths of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily spark it to target.
En pause, Gerrard Coulibaly exchanged with Ryan Kent, which almost instantly gave pot, when the flipper sent the ball to Morelos, but the well-player Kelly rushed from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the elderly to play on their premises with many long balls up the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's ambition could have expanded the leadership in the last part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a secure hand before Lithgow headed side of the target.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton reiterated a late penalty park after being drunk together with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also watched this second way.

Johnny English revise again – admirable spion comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to search for a Brexit angle in all recent movies with a British Island, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedy in Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
"Sarcastic boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, boss
Inkompetent Johnny English with rubber eye and large eyes has obtained permision to make browsing again- again. Ses name signalizes more than anything else that he's a comic discovery targeted to places where the movie visitors don't speak English.
Naturally, he's the dumpted secret agent, who, in spite of his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knifepid Mr. Bean, and a good jumped from him, who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics 2012.

There are some good moments in this last shot of the tribe of JE.
I liked Johnny English, when helicopter came close to a middle-aged helicopter, and the propells sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson’s talent for physical comics, but humor feels rather subtitulating and strangely overfishing, particularly now the more "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as a ingredient.
"Humoren allows me to be addressed to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventures are not just as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumbling film girlfriends in role as Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current point of the film is that Britain is in grave knife.
A Internet hacker has infiltrated England’s secrete network of spion and revealed the identity of all of the British agents in the field of terror of the agent responsible – a very small role of Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a pompous and combatable premier, who already suffers a total deflation of popularity politics: Emma Thompson does best with this Teresa May-like character, but there's not much to work with in the manuscript.
Da her security advisers informe her que cada spion activo a fost revelated, her needs to cancel any pension.
Evidence, Johnny English, who is now superinspector of a high school, but who secretly teaches in how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of School of Rock training in spionage.
English rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunied with its hard tested previous right hand Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a super entusiasmant but well-being submarine captain – a role on which Vicki Pepperdine was lost.
So, the Royal Intelligence Service, Batman and Robin, incomparable, come back, when they meet Olga Kurylenko belle femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is swinging closer to interfering with the charismatic and alarming technological billionaire Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough initiates their angry and risky capacities: Dressed as servants puts the fire in a French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves a bord of Voltas luxury yacht; and English create pure ragnarok while trying to use virtual reality glasses to familiarize themselves with Voltas house.
All the canons are liberated from the final sequence of the film, but, depending on what it is good and energic, there's a sense of childbirth view over it.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91> <0xE2><0x86><0x91>
I'm not able to avoid thinking with the other Johnny English film: "Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?"
Labour refuses to plan for 4 days work week with unchanged salaries to British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour says to think about a radical plan, so the Englishes can climb with a four-day work week, but get salaries for five.

It would mean that the employees would have three days weekend without going down on salaries.
Sources argue that the idea would coincide with the objective economic of the party to pull the country into a more favorable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to gain profit from a change economy.
A member of Larbour Party with experience said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"This will not happen on a day, but a four-day work week is a goal that corresponds to the party approach to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall strategy of the party for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such a idea, since the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign in Parliament elections in 2017.
However, this goal is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.

What is Global Citizens Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
The New York City is the host of Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; making end of the world’s poverty.
Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time ten thousand people in the big movies of Central Park, where they can wait for concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, festival will create awareness of the real goal, which is to make a end of extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of Global Poverty Project, a international organization of interest, which fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.

Create the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from their members targeted at different targets.
They believe that these actions have encouraged the leaders of the world to adopte objectives and actions politics binaires, equivalents to more than 37 billion dollars, which in 2030 are expected to have impacted more than 2,25 billion people.
Initial 2018, the group listed 390 targets and actions, which were made to their actions, which resulted in over 10 billion dollars, which were already paid or collected.
The Group estimate that these funds so far have had direct impact on 649 million people around the world.

As a response to one of the websites, which often are asked questions, "What do you think you're going to believe?", "We can do the end of extreme poverty."
Global Citizen wrote: "It'll be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we'll swing and make mistakes.
"Mas, as with the movement of citizenship and the movements against apartheid, it will succeed, because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
US can use its fleet to "bloque" for russian energy export, says US Interior Minister
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent energy of Russia from coming to the market, including in Middle East, declare Ryan Zinke, minister of Interior, Washington Examiner.
Sink Zinke affirma-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy like they do in the East and South Europe."
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"United States has the opportunity with our fleet to ensure that there is free passage on the sea roads, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that we can ensure that their energy doesn't come into market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of a meeting, such as the Consumer Energy Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization, which considers itself as “the voice of the voice of the American energy consumers of energy.”
He compared Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, and said that they are basically and basically equal.
"Oportunities economics compared to Iran and Russia are about the use and replacement of fuel," he said, while he referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy depends on fuel fossile.
These opinions follow the fact that the Trump administration aims to increase the exports of Europe of liquid natural gas, which must replace Russia, which is long the cheapest choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokespersons of Trump’s administration, including Donald Trump’s own, attempted to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” North Stream 2 leadership project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin Moscow’s “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moskva has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion cost North Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively a project economic.
Kreml considere que Washington's stronge resistence towards the project is a expression of disproportionate conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I believe that we share the opinion that energy shouldn't be a tool for exercing pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose a supplier," said Aleksandr Novak, ministro de Energie russ, in a later meeting in Moscow with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry, in September.
The position of Americans is confronted by criticism from Germany, who confirmed their participation in the project.
BDI, Germany’s leading organisation of the industry, has asked the USA to mixe outside EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem with the involvement of a third party in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, chef BDI, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.

President Donald Trump, US President Donald Trump, referralized Wednesday to China Daily's payed incursion in Des Moines Register – Iowa's best sales newspaper – after accusing China of intering China in Congress elections of 6 November. China rejects the accusation.
US officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese involvement in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign of pressing China.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to announce to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now closed in a escalating trade war, where they've set customs on import goods of each other several times.
China’s duty of expenditure in the War of Trade would affect exporters in states like Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American Ambassador of China, former governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of food agricultural to China, stated that Beijing has damaged laborers, farmers and businesses of America.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday of Des Moines Register, "China "supports the use of the infinite methods of conducting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"Under propagande propagande, Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of press by executing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register", - wrote Branstad.
"In chioskerms in Beijing, you'll find only few disagreements votes, and you'll not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people to the economic alarmant direction of China, since media are under stringent control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
"One of China's most important newspapers didn't publish its article, though he didn't say which.

The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend is Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees Open Source Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee jokeed that the plan with Inrupt is the "universal dominion".
"Non, we're gonna have to do so now," said the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
App uses Solids technology, so people can make their own "personal data collection online" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in one browser simultaneously.
What's unique in the personal online data collection is that it's entirely up to the user to determine who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to CEO of the company, John Bruce, is to collect resources, processes, and ability to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers of project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.

In a statement on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to offer commercial energy and a ecosystem that can guarantee integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee modified Internet, when he started World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called network neutrality debate.
While Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee continues to be inventor and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next period of Internet," agreguó Berners-Lee.

In the mornings, some of them were uninformed after they were awakening just this match.
One fan on Twitter describes the shift to a child's animation film as "a kind of sick joke."
"Desde la legislatura, this content wasn't adequate at 6:00 p.m., why they were obligated to change into programs for children," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President Senior Bellator, when asked him about the broadcast.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellators, said that they would work on incorporating English viewers in the planning future.
"When we think of the message, I think we can make it work," Coker.
"Las 6:00 p.m. am. Sunday morning, and we don't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday our time.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Had "Mini Sword" About Sexuality
Tom Daley, the Olympic pilot, says that he feels less worthy than everyone else in his growth because of his sexuality, but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't go up after him, before he came to the major classes, that "no all are like me."
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".

The usual host of the radio program, Kirsty Young, who long runs, took a few months free because of disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "minder value" than everyone else in his growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
"Desde today, he has the feelings of being worthy of memory and feeling different was the things that have given me strength to succeed."

The Double Olympic Bronze Winder has become a highly profiled LGBT defender and used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
"He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said that he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar Awards, 20 years older than him last year, but told him that the difference between age and age was never a problem.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> "He said that it's difficult to find someone in the same age, who has experienced similar subways and downways, when you go through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympic at his 14 years, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June, Parret became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
“Entonces, if you’d asked me, ‘Son año ago’, all that you’d asked, ‘I’d win a gold medal.’“
"But there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
Hans son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 a 40 years after diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley told him that his father didn't accept him to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they were getting tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to sit in front line.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there until that time.
"Entonces, 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces', 'Entonces'.'
The following year, Daley participó en 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I dreamed of all my life - that you would go before a home public at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," - he said.

Uskarp Mickelson on the bank to Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder Cup, but he must do something in the form if it's not going to be a trist miles.
Mickelson, who records for the 12th time to participate in the competition, which takes place every 2 years, was placed on the bank of Captain Jim Furyk because of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
In lieu de ser centro de eventos de los Estados Unidos, como usual, la quinque duplicate major agriturists must beat their game in the hope of correcting the swings.
Although not at the top point of his career, he had the most just drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course of Le Golf National, where the long rough often punit wild shooting.
"Entonces, if the track wasn't big enough oral, Mickelson will meet in the 9th match Sunday's always accurate winners of British Open Francesco Molinari, who's joined with newcommercial Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
"If Americans who start the 12 single matches start strongly, Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk expressed no surprise to believe in his teammate.
"Han ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n ́n

"He wants to be with him, like all the others."
Mickelson Nick Faldos record for most matches played in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career, which never fully could measured with his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 defeats, although Furyk said that his presence contribute to something indefinible.
“Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"I think also that the younger players were amusant to play against him this week, which was amusant to see.
"He contribuye mucho más que solo game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn, Europe’s Captain Thomas Bjørn, knows that great leadership can soon disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knowing experience that a solid drive before the last day of the Ryder Cups single-ups can quickly become nervous.
The Dance debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point predecessor of five points above Americans, but was just going to be captured before the goal match with a victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 .
"You continue to remember yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just just won," Bjørn says after seeing the 2018 team won both 5-3 Friday and at a total lead on 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not open.
A tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso tso
Go and do everything that is right.
I'm not finished before you have the points on the table.
“We have a goal, and it’s to try to win the trofee, and that’s where our focus is.
“I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Bearn adds, "I don't take anything from this for the giveth.
“Next tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
"Tomorrow there are individual performances that count, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be there with a partner when it goes well, but when you're there alone, you're tested on all parameters as a golf player.
“Importants will be able to know what’s best in you tomorrow.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> "Now you must leave your partner, so that you will find him better than yourself."
Differently, it looks like opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced ligaments in the last day. First on the victory team in Brookline, before he lost when Europe made "Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said, "when asked him how Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999 had spoken to his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want a good start like you saw at Brookline like you saw at Medinah.
When momentum has found a direction, it puts great pressure on the middle fights.
"Nonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn."
Thomas has received the task of trying to lead backwards and face Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other European players in the first half of the ranking.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think that's guaranteeing us all the way through," Bjørn said about his choice of single players.

The German Navy's latest fregat would have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the War Cold. But the Germans must wait at least one year further because of technical problems and a escalating price, write local media.
The insertion of the largest vessel in the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregatas, "Rheinland-Pfalz", is deducted into the first half of 2019, according to the journal Die Zeit, citing a spokesman of the military.
Ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have disturbed the ambitious project.
4 vessels de la Baden-Wuerttemberg Class, re-ordered by la flotte in 2007, shall replace vessels de la Bremen Class.
If you know them that they would have a powerful canon, a large selection of anti-air shooting and anti-navy missiles as well as technology stealth such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.

“But repetitive delays implies that the advanced vessels of war – which, decisamente, will make Germany to appear as an overseas power factor – will already be deceased when they are inserted,” write Die Zeit.
The failed F125-fregat created titles last year, when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Store in Hamburg.

It was not much known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made warship inutile in situations of combat.
The error of software was of particular importance, since ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a mansion of 120 semi-slims – it is only half of mansion of older Bremen fregates.
It also proved that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the possibility of future updates.
The 7000 tons of language "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germans during Second World War.
In addition to hardware error, the price of the project, which includes training the talent, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a declining € 3,1 bilion (3,6 bilion $), with a price original € 2,2 bilion.

This knowledge can help determine the advantages of habitat-conservative insertions, such as the establishment of bees, and how to best preserve forest areas for mucus flagers and similar species.
The number of flaggants in Scotland and UK has declined dramatically in the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect the roads and limit their habitat.

They have ten trained experts, who often collect data, inspect the reeds and sometimes make rescue actions.
The Organization has even created the first and only reserve of Scotland's first and unique dedicated mushrooms of flagship in the area of Threave in Dumfries, Dumfries, Galloway, and Galloway, home to 8 out of 10 of Scotland's flagship mushrooms of flagship.

Ronaldo rejected prosecutions of violence, while advocats complained of German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called him abuse accusations for "fake news" and says that people "will promote themselves" using his name.
Seu avocats prepare to appeal the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus was accused of violating a woman American, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
"It's assumed that he's paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
"Oh, what they say today is fake news," said the 5th winners of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"Desde, they will promote themselves using my name.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They shall be glorious, saying my name, but they are a part of the work.
“I am a good man, and everything is good,” adds player smiling.
Ronaldo’s advocats prepare to appeal Der Spiegel due to the accusations, which they’ve called according to Reuters “a publication incomparable of suspicions about the sphere of privacy”.
Attorney Christian Schertz says that player would seek compensation for "moral abuse in a class similar to the accusation, which presumably is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The Event occurred presumably in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga assumed to return to the room of the player, where he must have violated her anal, according to the report presented in the county of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga affirme que Ronald falled on his knees after the assertioned incident and said that he was "a good man 99% of time" arrested by "one percent".
The prosecutors argued that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was consent.
Mayorga assert également que she went to police and photographed her injuries in hospital, pero que she later joined a deal outside tribunal, because she sent "attentate of retribution" and anxiety about becoming "public exit".
The 34-year-old now says she will circumcide the deal, since she is still deeply influenced by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo standing in front of a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event had taken place, and switched this summer to the Italian Stork Club Juventus for € 100 million.
Brexit: UK "will forever regret" to lose automakers
UK "will regrette it forever", if it lost its status as leader automobile manufacturer global after Brexit", said minister of Business Greg Clark.
"He added that it was "beautiful" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain quit EU without agreement, it would temporarily reduce production in Burnaston near Derby factory.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
Japan Automobile Manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
La Burnaston Factory, la Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, producer quasi 150.000 automobiles last year, 90 % of which exported to rest of the EU.
"As i see, production will stop in our factory, if Britain will fume out of the EU at the end of March," said Burnaston CEO, Marvin Cooke.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover, express fears of leaving the EU without a trade agreement over the border.
BMW says that they will close their Mini Factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
La principal embraction of automakers is related to the risks of supply chain in the event of unexpected exit.
Toyota’s production runs in a stretch schedule, where shares come every 37 minutes from suppliers in both UK and EU.
Si Brittany abandone EU without agreement on 29 March, there could be problems in front of the border, which, according to automotive industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
"It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day production in Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped," the company said.
Clark, decisamente, declare que Theresa Mays Chequers plan for future negociations with EU "esta 'convergent', decisamente avoiding these supervisions at the border."
"We must have a deal. We will have the best deal, which will not only allow us - as I call it - to enjoy our current success, but also to take this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"Toyota's opinions and other manufacturers indicate that we must be able to continue what has been a successful supply chain."
Toyota couldn't say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, higher prices would reduce competitivity of the factory, which ultimately will cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says, "Mistionary experience tells me that, as soon as these jobs disappear, they'll never come back."

Trump, deputy deputy minister of justitis, risking Mueller’s independence, has been a veteran in Washington for months.
New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein considered carrying microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of posting president via paragraf 25.
Rosenstein rejected news.
La propera zi de la semana, subindu-se a la Casa Blanca, a venit la Casa Blanca.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was agreed on Thursday, who was at that time in the United Nations headquarters of New York.
Trump affirmed that he would "not prefer" to kill Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with Senate court committee, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of abuse sexual, should testify.
Trump ordered Friday a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed Senate elections.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was in Fox News Sunday.

“But we must see, and I always like to keep press updated.”
Some reporters would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that absence of press conferences wasn't because of TV reporters game game for gallery, but added: "I don't agree with that they play up to camera."
"She said that contact direct between Trump and the press will be increased.
"President insiste on more questions than any presidency before him," he adds, without citing a source, "we've seen the numbers."

"We are trying to give you a rich opportunity, and you've seen that we've done in the past few weeks, and it'll stand in place of press conferences, when you can talk to President of America."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House, or participates in open hearings or press conferences with high-end guests.
The press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
"This week in New York, President showed why when he made an improvized and occasionally mystical figure before the present journalists.

Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when they buy houses in UK
Buyers of foreign countries are charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in Britain. The extra money must help the homeless according to the conservative party.
This trajectory must beat Corbyn's success by attracting young voters.
The higher taxes of stamp will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will gain £ 120 million annually to the unfamiliar.
Theresa May will propose today that buyers of foreign countries will be charged a higher stamp tax when they buy property in Britain, in favor of the homeless.
The retreat will be regarded as a tentative of responding to Jeremy Corbyn's success of attracting young voters with promises of cheaper residences and following them with the highest income.
Increment of tax of stamp will englobe persons and corporations who don't pay tax in UK. Increment of this should be used to combat government to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.

Many rich regions in the country, particularly in the capital, have become "city of turbulence" due to the high number of foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside of the country.
The new bill is coming only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed to cut off the stamp tax in order to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused major building and building firms of keeping the prices of property by buying reasons they don't use. He asked May to drop quotas of cheap housing to solve "situation of residence of Britain."

Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's coach"
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimative goal" is a time to become Scotland's coach.
The Scotch of 42 enjoys the challenge of restoring the club from North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from top.
He moved to Stadium of Light Summer after taking St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," said Ross BBC's Sportsound of Scotland.
"Maybe, I grew up to see Scotland at Hampden with my father, when I was a child, and it was always pulled in me.
“Important, this option would happen only if I succeeded in training clubs.”
Ross's predecessors for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says that he had no concerns about following the established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Ahora, i'll measure success from whether I can get this club back in Premier League."
"Basically based on the structure and facilities of this club, it's definitely home in Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task, but I think I'll see myself as a successful here if I can bring the club back to it."
Ross is only three years in his career as coach after a period assistente coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Hearts coach team.
Alloa aids back after being ripped in the third line and transformed St Mirren from the turbulence to the title winners of the following season.
And Ross says that he feels more adapted now than he ever did during his career as player for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That's probably a real way of separation," he remembers the time of Alloa.
"I honestly thought that the training was the right thing for me, better than being a player.
I think it's strange because I found it perfect, I earned reasonably and I had some success experiences.
But it can be difficult to play.
There are many things you need to go through on the basis of the week.

Shepherd was known in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a high vigilance election in March's special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for over 10 years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a little advantage.
US planned to punish El Salvador for support to China, but re-determined
Diplomats noted that Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendship meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, in Panama, and had a hotel in Panama, in Panama, until partners deployed Trump’s leadership team.
"Representatives of the Minister of Foreign Affairs" (Reuters), "Republic of Dominican Republic and Panama" (Republika Dominican Republic and Panama), "Republic of El Salvador" (Republic of Dominican Republic and Panama), "Resolución de no reconnaissance de Taiwan" (Republic of Dominican Republic and Panama), "Heather Nauert, spokeswoman of the Minister of Foreign Affairs," (Reuters).
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received about $ 140 million from US in 2017 for bla.narcotics control, development and financial support.

Initial meetings, oficiars nord-amerikans and central-americans, initial meeting on security and economic development, should have continued the meeting of the last year, which was considered a step towards preventing emigrants from arriving to the USA.
But in mid-September, the top officials clarified that they would like the conference to take place, and thus abandoned the thoughts of punishment to El Salvador.
"Vice-President Mike Pence must talk to the conference planned until mid-October, in order to send a signal of the importance of Americans putting in the meeting," said diplomats.
And the three American broadcasters took secretly back to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without new demands or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman of Bolton from the White House no wanted to comment on the details of the case, descrived by three officials of the United States, including two diplomats, who would like to talk about internal considerations, if they remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by anarchist outsider, who is close to the administration, and who also spoke on a condition of anonymity.
Historia
The next obstacle could very well be the special accusation of Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle of the investigation, which is notable and publicly accessible evidence.
“Mueller will also resolve his investigation against the question of whether Trump’s campaign cooperated secretly with Russia about the attack on elections.
“If Congress would come into new hands, Trump would probably be assumed responsibility while preparing to meet electors again and with time give sure a jury of his comrades.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty, and I’m not saying Trump’s final is inevitable – and the same thing applies to his counterparts in Europe.

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic before the battle against SK Rapid Wien
The Rangers take Thursday against SK Rapid Vienna. After impressive unrealized results in Spain against Villarreal early in the month, with a victory against Austrians, they will have good chances to get from the G Group of Europe League.
A knee damaged prevented midway player Graham Dorrans from getting a seasonal start-up before 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers could use the result as a jumper for something even greater.
"It's a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," he said.

Public accusers try to get terrorist suspected in NYC condemned rarely death penalty
Public accusers attempt to condemn Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare penalty, which was last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov in October allegedly used a car rental from the building market Home Depot to execute assault on a bicycle road along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and bicyclers who came to the road were cut down.
As the foundation of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intensively" assassinated the eighth victims and "intensively" causing serious personal damage. This is required by the intentional declaration of death penalty in Southern District of New York.
According to the jurisprudence, death penalty is possible result of both of these expectations.

how the trade war between USA and China can be a benefit for Beijing
The opening salts in the War of Trade between the USA and China were high-speed, and although the battle was far away from the end, the division between the countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump claimed the first alerting ahead of this year, imposing tariffs on important Chinese exporting products, e.g. solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation of this week with new customs taxes affecting goods worth 200 trillion dollars, in principle, applies to half of all goods imported to the USA from China.
Beijing has made every time in return, last by imposing taxes of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States throughout the way, and the second largest economy in the world is likely not just ahead of time.
"If it makes Washington retreat its demands, it means they give it back, but for President China, Xi Jinping, it's gonna be too shameful to retreat to USA.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays his cards correctly, the American pressure in the War of Trade could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a groove for a economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it's actually much more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, coworker of research focused on Asia at the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
