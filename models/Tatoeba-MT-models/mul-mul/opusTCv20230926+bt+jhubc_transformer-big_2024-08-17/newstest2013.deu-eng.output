A Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the last a myth, confirming that election fraud in the U.S. is more rare than the number of people killed by the flash attack.
The Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of election fraud in the U.S. in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009 that harm the procedure for registration or entry.
This phenomenon has gained significance after the November 2010 elections, which enabled 675 new Republican representatives to be registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative proposals were introduced only in 2011, limiting the exercise of voting law in 41 countries.
The new election law requires the voters to submit a photo image proof and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for premature voting, declare invalid the right to register as a voter on the day of election, and citizens have the right to vote for which a court act is present.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state requested voters to present a photo image.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities tried to extend these practices to other countries.
Over the past two years, they have encouraged legislative drafts in 34 states that will force the voters to present a photo image.
It is important to note that U.S. citizens, unlike Quebec, do not have a universal outlook card such as health insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligibility persons do not have any photo imagery issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million newborns do not have such a certificate in 2012.
However, it is often necessary to pay more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required certificate.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities, and people with low income.
In fact, 25% of Afro-Americans, 15% of people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required photo image.
This is still enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who give their voice to democratic candidates are not allowed in several countries to use their photographic evidence issued by their establishment.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting companies to more strongly choose for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state has requested proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Spanish votes.
There are two out of three Hispanic voters who prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight state states that cancel the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections have contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Since the measures adopted since 2009, the share of the 2010 registration of new currency has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for the early vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the predecessors were Afro-Americans, although only 13% of the state’s voters were.
The same applies to the Spanish population.
Later, only 11% of the voters represented, but 24% of the citizens who were elected in advance.
On the contrary, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters were elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voters’ registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetos of the democratic governors.
The U.S. lawyer has interfered with the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the presentation of a photo image.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly harm the exercise of the voting right.
Democratic critics advocate the political nature of the laws adopted and see the impact of the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that have adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral committee to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislative system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on election participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Early diagnosis of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test is wise in fact sometimes finding incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger concerns of the already uncertain men for the implementation of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous disorders between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of post-observation, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relatives who have already had prostate cancer.
In men of Afro-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer must be truly understood by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, he decides to actively monitor the disease.
Today, there is no treatment in many men who have identified cancer, as their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and provide treatment to them in advance of the disease.
With increasing accuracy, you determine the criteria for a decision who should be treated and who not.
Therefore, I still recommend performing the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there are no miracles to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there was no smokers anymore, this value would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman of Canadian cancer society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Some are also completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously harms the health of people.
"There is still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after resigning from cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to Canadian cancer society, overweight and adipositas also promote the eruption of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, mast, dishes, throat and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that regular physical activity protects against intestinal cancer throughout life,” he added.
The Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of having a grim or mast intestinal cancer.
Trees should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salt can lead to carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and cause cancer to develop,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their investigations are currently not decisive.
According to Canadian cancer society, studies are contradictory to vitamin E.
While a study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-load.
"Making an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has inspired a certain view last summer, and this is for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle, whose existence from the standard model - our best or "at least wrong" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - has not yet been observed, but empirically.
But for the physicians, it is not completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of any doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be completely safe about it.
Nevertheless, let’s assume that it’s actually the higgs, because there seems to be just a low risk of being deceived, and let’s look at what’s going on.
There is a mandatory law in this world that does not allow two objects to be present at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strongly as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particulate physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that it also applies to them a similar law: the principle of Pauli exclusion, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same room at the same time when they are in the same "quant state" with this "status" consists of some of their characteristics as a whole.
From this, physicians divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, the good citizens, called Fermione, are well obedient to the Pauli principle.
And on the other hand, the Bosons, a bad band of anarchists, to whom nothing is holy, are certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time in the same place.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure by the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing): the mesons that we are not treated here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs-Boson would somehow be related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such an exotic creature as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "boot" of electromagnetic power.
In fact, if a particle is accelerated with an electric load or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" precisely in that place, for example, as a screwstone thrown into a tea.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing else than a photon and therefore one of the "power carriers" bosons.
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs-Field, has to be "distorted" in order that this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the stimulator has to reach very high energy, a little similar to a frozen sheet, whose surface could only be broken down by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a scope of 27 km! - to reach such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the Mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet paper would never keep it in the refrigerator itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it own a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not own a mass.
For what can all these research now be "good", asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, they serve the verification of the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicians to carefully examine all deviations between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are many physicians who hope that such deviations will be found as the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It is necessary to say that the latter still has big disadvantages, since it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups! again).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these researches on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no one.
By the way, in the early 60’s, the laser pioneers in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 developed the first permanent threshing machine (the first ones were pumped) - has already said that the laser was considered at first rather than a "labor playground".
Imagine your...
In addition, applications can also be derived from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle in 1969 developed a small light sensor during his optics work.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves as an eye to all digital cameras worldwide and has introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC activities will necessarily change our lives, but that means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With the Committee on Death in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the weak question of life.
The debate must be restarted soon, although a draft law will be prepared.
However, there is still a lot to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that raised him had left him for a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed to live for seven years," he said half-time, in his palliative care house, Victor-Gadbois, in Beloeil, where he arrived yesterday.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease makes their work: an inevitably weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he willingly resigns to help himself eat.
He can even smile and talk to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to cure my diarrhoea because this is humiliating,” he said.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this evil.
“During our lifetime, we know that a man is standing pink,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Returning to the stage of childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person to take a retreat," he notes.
Because, according to several people working in palliative care, large events take place in the middle of these retreats.
Patients who are invited to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will no longer be covered by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with the so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by exaggeration”.
Because of the disease, I really knew my children.
“I have good children,” she added.
"I don't have any desires in my life anymore," she says before she accepts that you put her a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son coming from Italy in the next few days.
Victor-Gadbois at home offers a group of volunteer body care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care will be used if there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 residents have a bed for palliative care.
This is very little when we take into account that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire, the deceased is given a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the dead.
“We help relatives and patients equally,” says Nurse Director Nathalie Savard.
At Victor's Gadboy, there is no day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting at the courtyard and is well supported by his headchildren as he is honored, a 36-year-old man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies tragically after trying to survive everything.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been treated with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who have been admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. a care that should relieve patients’ suffering if they have reached the final stage of their life, either at home, hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal Area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this major insufficient in Quebec’s health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are facing concerns about the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto in circulation has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to reveal their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before acceptance to move to death aid.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to relieve her.
I am afraid that patients want to die only because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions until the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were minimal when she had discontinued complaint chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I would stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she told her.
But she told me I was over!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked for death are thanks to the nursing staff for not being given this desire after their pain has been reliefed by a palliative care team.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, the head of palliative care of the home palliative care company in the Greater Montreal Area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Throughout the end of life, the doctors often rely on the terminal sediment, which goes beyond, either sporadically or permanently sleeping the patient until the time of his death.
We can’t do it anymore as if we don’t notice this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to apply to this terminal sedimentation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved, all say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to sleep me,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian Health Research Institutes.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the street building office, companies of the main building industry, buyers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction economy, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafia are deployed.
A "industrial" that was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system breaks down since you've taken drastic measures," said Jacques Duchesneau, Quebec deputy and former police chief in Montreal.
The scandal was discovered by him due to a thorough investigation of violations related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only consented contradictoryly.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and staffing.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport has saved only a billion dollars on the contracts," because some of them have stumbled their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to the case," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The 2011 launched permanent anti-corruption unit also undertakes great efforts with its troops of government auditors, detectors and analysts.
In addition, police officers of the Marteau Force, which since 2009 has made the Montreal Canalization Cartell more restrainable at the artificial blowing of the treaties.
In recent weeks, she has conducted extensive domestic investigations and raised charges of fraud and corruption against municipal mandateholders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a municipality.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected that in exchange for public procurement, he has repeatedly received scratch funds.
In addition, they were expressly accused of engineers of the street building office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Later, the supervision has been excited by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public procurement.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito held his hand all over the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were at that time in power.
He also managed to organize an illegal acquisition of funds for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Cancellation contracts whose cost was artificially inflicted by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and eishockey games, as well as coverage funds of $736,000 as a compensation for channeling contracts, which he artificially inflated.
Other officials of the street construction office have admitted that they were allowed to smell by artificially inflating the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately taking a look at a shadow budget that fills his cashes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned early November, falling into a severe crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who hit the alarm.
As the mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rejected the sale of a municipal property from 2010 that it was purchased for $5 million and re-selled to builders for 1.6 million in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in election campaigns
From the investigation which is finally carried out, she says that it "drakes on a thread that allows you to understand the functioning of the system undermined by bulbs to stop the evil and push the guilty."
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but we need a single detection unit for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean it.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, however, that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is primarily concerned about the role of "man's wearers who are over the tactics in the image" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a percentage of 70% of black money in the funding of Quebec election campaigns, he boasts: "I was told that this is just a weak breakdown of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to $100, which would not change the situation according to him: "Unless the campaign expenditure is strictly limited, black money will be in politics."
He recommends a complete review of the system for public procurement and funding of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going on things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau asks those who laugh about it to look at their own backdrop...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season, you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players are here.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break up in enthusiasm.
Since my beginning in the centre of the preparation training of the INF Clairefontaine to my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have made progress gradually.
You will benefit from the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to carrying games at very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me, who has to offer the front and want to give his best.
Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the highest respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I went to an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he put in me is also a statement for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to join our words against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first of our group in front of Porto so that we can play the back game of the Achtel Final as a home game.
Can the PSG in the short term become a big European association?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a big European association, Paris must win titles and become a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to adopt this project in concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure to not win the title in the Ligue 1 as it was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to reject this title.
In the last season, we were close to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to avoid the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even though the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring the title, I think we have the opportunity to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected from us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something that can be ahead of us, that is definitely a little frustrating.
You’re wondering what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we have proven strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and has also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were believed to be a 15-point game break!
It was said that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren’t good in the last season, were “built” by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performance.
It's better to talk about a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and many doors shoot.
That's why he came and he proved that he was the Star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has led to his eyes that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, one of the world’s best defenders, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very pleased to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from getting out of time.
I have seen things from which I have come strongly.
Today I can perform good games in the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our teaching, and today we have to put an example of behaviour on the day.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of "Blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and appeals to victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Is this a start-up game for forced uncertainty in Spain on October 16 (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been used for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payments and sales are possible without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision can be grasped: the belief that the current monetary system, developed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent that allows direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a gift or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the courses are listed on the website of bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are simultaneously stored by accounts, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the trading Bitcoins are available in the public accounts book distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This happens through a mathematical task that starts on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege to add these additional lines.
This is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprints.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
When this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unlinked as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but shared to a hundred million sets, allowing a certain gambling space.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The used weakness does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced the Paymium, which is a real-money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
Cash, however, also has these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others like the WordPress Blog Platform are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron have analyzed the Israeli Weizmann Institute’s accounting book and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega closing sale" was launched.
“Three thousand dollars have been exchanged,” Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with traders, and the latter does not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized by a phone", says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of stronger horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take a while until Bitcoin runs, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, proposes to re-evaluate the various risks that today are highly regarded in the event of success of this currency.
We moved from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. will follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to recover the possession of its territory and the Afghan population to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan peasants by viewing them as terrorists.
And we ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and tortured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbekistan and Tadshiki.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed by a hill planted with mandel trees, financed with French loans, was carried out correctly.
The truck and tanker convoys flying by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will no longer be any Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irrespective progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, and the country was overflowed by the struggles of the various rising groups of war.
Their power overtake was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurity of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved so far.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmakers by taking possession of the government’s land to sell them as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive US subcontraction.
They have become professionals, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting.
As I’ve heard in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn’t consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who could benefit the U.S. spending: capital escape is significant.
The young people are satisfied with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world, and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurity of the invasive parties or to corruption of certain leaders will need to provide jobs.
All, even the armed parties, are occupied with mobile phones; TV with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under which they will be enforced be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already strive to restore the militia in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state from it with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in the case of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and has long been dependent on foreign aid.
Industries were not rebuilt, functional dust plants were not available and important watering systems were not repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is a priority.
In a country under 30 years of war, governmental control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumors have been spread that Afghanistan possesses enormous land values.
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only in place to power them.
Without energy to process iron or copper on site, or without transport means for export through the mountains, there is no mining possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to make their excavations at the gigantic Buddhist site and remaining the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports, rebuild normal relationships.
The withdrawal of the French fighters was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young girls, Institute for French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil-military action" service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), set up in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit jobs and measures for the recovery of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization task to try to achieve the "hearts and spirits" and to win.
These work, for which many local workers were required, have helped suppress the revolt: watering, springs, drinking water, re-exploring, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural utility areas.
What souvenir will we give back to military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often at a height of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to free the farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their desire, would require the continuation of smaller, well controlled and directly related civil assistance in their favour.
A Constitution with the Breaking Strike in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt, as regards the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him the unlimited power, remains more divided than ever, he decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this Plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt is now based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text for nearly two years, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal conflict.
This new initiative has only provided for a further division of the country.
For his opponents, the president endures in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "broke his word" and "the right goes by foot."
On the sides of his supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forced the brothers to abandon their plans to explain to the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to recover his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is dying throughout the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, when the Egyptian people with this assault on a overwhelming vote are put to an end: “You either agree to my draft or I will retain the unlimited power,” the latter should likely end after adoption of the Constitution.
85 most Islamic members of this constitutional assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not meet the invitation.
Shortly before the mid-November constitutional declaration, they turned away, as they believe they were unable to implement their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
To achieve decision-making yesterday morning, 11 deputy members were added in all hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
On the other hand, the commentators found it funny that the only divergence of the day was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the Board believed that the Pendeluhr of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text that was adopted last night consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which draws all attention to itself, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The salafistic parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing “the principles” by “the rules”, which would have made it possible to apply more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Holyness" responds to the Liberals who only consider this as a propaganda strike.
According to them, Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in view of which the University of Al-Azhar recognises an advisory function, in particular with regard to verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because "people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of theocracy here.”
The fears of the Liberals are also feeded by the fact that the next director of this university is far less modest than the present.
“Now there is no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civilian state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system,” said Alexis Blouet, who wrote a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitution Stransion.
However, he concludes that, as regards Article 220, there may be multiple clarity, since the terms used are rejected by the religious dictionary.
This particularly refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Adm.
And in the future, the question could be raised in how competent civilian judges are to decide about it.”
In addition to his religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized due to the extensive powers he has given to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another question is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military’s request, the review of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have requested to defend human rights.
The latter also share their concerns with respect to the text they consider as a threat to freedom.
The effect of blasphemy will be maintained, and misleading is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, in particular for the press.
In addition, no article no longer refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the world's navel and a sea of sunshine
The Blessed Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and intact nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Prevent in front of the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessings.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding feast, walking on the water, sewing the sea storm and fishing.
Just here Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
Most of the temples are located in Jerusalem.
Believers do here the path of suffering or cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the graveyard church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossing site, the anointed stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here is a Christian view of the Nabel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew up.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the plaintiffs, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.E.
Traditionally, people of different religions leave there sets with desires that then come into fulfilment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fort Massada form the remains of the secret hidden from enemies, which Herod the Great built for his family in 25 BC.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above the sea level.
Only mountain climbs can reach the ruins from their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airline to this historical summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts innumerable tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski piste has a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods claimed to live on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
Only one trip can’t be visited by everyone.
But at least the five of them most interesting should be visited.
Among them is the Israeli Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are preserved ancient Qumran manuscripts or writing rolls from the Dead Sea found in rocky holes in the Judean desert, and approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bath Al Basha, which hosts several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath servants at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops there.
The entry is free, and donations are basically rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking department is the monument for children, which was built to remind the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, complete darkness dominates.
Stars function.
The names of the Judeans and the lands where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinaries and oceans.
Incredibly, the Red Sea is also bathed in winter months, since the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air heats up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bath throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turkish blue water has a high salt content and thus carrys even non-swimming easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is unprecedentedly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments with salt water (natural salt salt) and cure mushrooms, as well as treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and to calm down strapaceed nerves.
Touch the secrets of the age
These secrets provide the old city of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea road, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia, was linked to each other.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to deliveries, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna must hold the legend after all those who touch the walls in the street with their star mark.
In Jaffa, you can find newly transferred pairs from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crucifixion.
In the Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governor, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre lists evening concerts and operas today.
List of tourists
When you go to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English knowledge: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the journey is preferred to be taken not in euro, but in dollars that can be easily exchanged in checks (the current exchange rate: $1 to 3.8 checks).
In the city you usually get forward by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway, and in Haifa there is the only subway line in the country with six stations that connect the subway to the upper city.
Exactly taken, it is an underground standing path.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of transportation, which is sufficient for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is held in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and guest restaurants, only cooking food is served, which excludes swine meat, seafood, fish without snacks and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with ham, beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fryed balls of purified beans and herbs, as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no disgusting dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
To do this, there are many well-fed cats that are comfortable and unpleasant to run through the streets.
Even in the evening, you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parking cars.
Cats like living places and don’t say no to flavors.
A car rental costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entrance tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational searchers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the prosperous country, equivalent to a 51% increase in the 2010 comparison period, prior to the withdrawal of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and Citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on compulsory freight tests for migrants, criminals already act with fake certificates
Each year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tadshikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families staying in their homes.
On December 1, a law has entered into force, according to which every worker has to issue a test that certifies the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will be required for all guest workers in the future.
It is not only necessary to put track tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both the retention and prolongation of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
In addition, persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 are exempted from this Act.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entire exams are under the head of the Pushkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can perform tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, civil lawmakers asked several times before the entry into force of the law in the press: What does this actually bring?
What changes brings the requirement to demonstrate language skills for both the Russians and the host workers?
In particular, with regard to the Migration Authority’s spokespersons, it is important to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Most people are now talking about the protection of workers' rights," said Viktor Sebelew, head of the representative of the Federal Migration Authority in Tadschikistan.
However, their rights are already to be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants with no profession, education, language skills and medical evaluation are facing problems.
Sebelew is convinced that a future immigrant without language skills will necessarily encounter bad intentions who put him in a dark, narrow bark under the abundance of help, where he will endure with dozens of months of his equivalent without food and documentation and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the country you will have a promise, and when you arrive you will be frauded, get their passports taken away and won't get the promised wage," said Tolib Schwaripow, head of the Danish Labour Migration Office.
Don't shit, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to make their money in Russia agree that they are not only able to dominate the language of the target country but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not their fault, but the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekistan and Tadschiken can also provide reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed their children, unless they buy decent clothes, shoes, and school bags.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to make money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humiliated and low quality."
Citizens emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must be tested.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Great welcome" or "Access prohibited for non-employed"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and of course the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be made quickly and only for a half a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and there are cases of oppression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tadschike Umed Huschkadamow said to journalists.
"No expenses for false papers"
On the day of entry into force of the law, it was found that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be fake.
Some fake certificates that certify the completion of the cargo test have already been arrested by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for free: every migrant who hoped to save the tests would pay seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: this costs a worker three thousand rubles.
The main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil rights defenders agree.
For the moment, authorities may only promise hospital workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a language base course.
In addition, new arrivals are offered places without language knowledge in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
The Ministry of Interior ignores the illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons and crimes is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to reinforce the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities respond to the recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven deaths in the mock of Moscow’s lawyer Dmitri Winogradw.
Police want to prohibit non-mortal weapons in the public and lift the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the Chairman of the Duma Security and Corruption Committee, Irina Jarowaja, and has promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted soon in the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attraction of screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - require the authorities to take a distance from "insignificant aggravations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal lawyer Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC service, said.
According to the Internal Ministry’s statistics, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the enlargement of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the dissemination of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
Weapons come across several channels to the black market.
There are five such major channels, tells former Commander Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen the order defenders of criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by staff of the law enforcement authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
Many military camps have often occurred in explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was firefighting to prevent the absence of weapons," the former military officer said.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market is also made by the arms manufacturers.
“Today, there are numerous private arms factories that do not stand up for international competition and therefore dismantle the weapons under the hand on the black market, such as in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the shame.
Especially a lot of guns and weapons come from poor countries such as Kirgisistan.
“There is a own, sometimes craft production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggler,” the former military officer explains.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was published by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service of State Statistics, Criminal Literature and publicly accessible data on portals on arms.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the army and the law enforcement authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by "the duty of those responsible who have been involved in their work with weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser of an arms store that doesn’t want to be named namely assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been buying no one since they are old.
According to him, it is more frequent that traders take care of the posts in an arms warehouse.
A weapon, for example a gun of the type TT, is purchased through a gunfire.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the ring.
“The trader brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
“Of course, the police know about everything, and therefore, if they can’t comply with the crime detection plan, they regularly check purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,” the sales adviser added.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers are most commonly known to each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone looked at me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja", where someone would wait for me to bring me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I found only there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To take care of a weapon, I need a familiar who has contacts," said the sales adviser. "I have such a familiar, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you have to go and spread with a code like "of Iwan Iwanowich, which allows the daughter to have lost a tooth".
I’m currently even getting a few shots about a familiar person I trust.
He also gives me the strike ring just because he knows that I don't crawl him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything is possible" was depicted.
"I felt like in the luxury store," the military members recall.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the pocket, but can try everything.
I as a potential customer buy not just, but go with the seller in the forest, and there we set up a target plate.
“I can shoot there, and if I’m convinced that the gun has a good shot, we’ll negotiate with each other,” the expert said.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or personal meetings are needed.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy fighting guns or guns".
There users make your orders and make requests.
Will they be sold to minors as well?
"Of course without a license," the user asks "Iwan" (oral quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service has recently switched off numerous web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and can shield coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
The controllers accept the orders.
The buyer provides the money through a banking machine.
"As a response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and come back to gitters when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched off numerous web sites, and buyers who want to buy weapons go to the service.
"People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in the Siberian work camp and can shield coal," he said.
A Makarow for $100
When buying illegal firearms, experts expect prices from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a macarow type gun for $100 to $300.
You need to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by supervisors in the middle range.
According to the Ministry of Interior official statistics, the number of illegal weapons offences in Russia fell from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and eruption related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
Fast-food and supermarket employees strike in the United States
Every fourth U.S. teenager sits behind Mc Donald's cash
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to blow up or whether the air will come out soon again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-oriented non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and Fast-food employees, protest organizers pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this industry has been hardly organised trade unions.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handmade.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work together with trade unions and left activists, branches of the chain whose target group is low and medium-income people.
Walmart sells all products, ranging from winding to hunting fires and car batteries to dust saucers, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the smallly paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
Prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complains of severe working conditions, such as lack of wire plugs or hand scanner.
The protesters on Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the operational health insurance increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns $9.5 per hour, can’t afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley have shown that if the company raises the average wage to $12 per hour, Walmart would cost $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than they now donate for wages.
If Walmart would completely transfer the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be more than $ 12.39 per year compared to today.
Walmart’s supporters are pleased to note that there were only nine states of protests, which did not protect the company from any loss.
The Black Friday lasted in his store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second during this period.
In total, Walmart’s cashes took over nearly 100 million transactions at Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-oriented Huffington Post that in total "less than five" Walmart employees established the work and the protest was merely "a further PR trick" of the unions that organized the protests.
"Free Cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, however, where their destination was not Walmart branches (which were not desirable in this advanced city and therefore have not yet existed), but were McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a day of hospitality, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York law is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is increasing, but not too strong, and on average, their simple employees get $8.90 per hour.
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city.
As far as possible, spending as little money in New York is incomprehensible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths after McDonald's school stood behind the theke, but the youths still lived with their parents.
One saw the main source of income or plans to stay there longer.
Now, at interviews with McDonald's employees I constantly meet people who complain that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment, whose authors notice that it is irresponsible to get children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, who started Thursday at 6:30 a.m. before McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashier and cook of Fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the Fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal and rejecting or dismiss unions members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protest was a meeting in the afternoon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't have a hospitality day, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said "we should support the fast-food employees together so that they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity each New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, not all of them in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands are working in New York City.
It is still unpredictable whether the rain of these protests will mobilize the entire masses.
“The brain can only be moderately overlisted so far.”
The theme of advanced reality popular with supporters of modern technologies has been seen recently by the lens of a special glasses.
In the summer, Google introduced a functioning model at its annual conference, and in November, it was announced that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies at the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses for the researchers of the company were just a passage station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with only hands and creating virtual open surfaces.
- Please describe shortly what research your group operates.
“We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has mostly remained stuck in the phase where pixels are working on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no Xbox will be sold without Kinect because everyone is interested in moving control.
- What else do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system gets more data) could have been improved, the issue has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more catchy.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also its environment.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtue objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stunned virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She is popular, but isn't she overrated?
- She is certainly not the universal solution because she raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform everyone about her actions and intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, we worked in the area of the management of objects on public places in a project where we experimented with short and short gestures rather than exciting gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but it could theoretically be reduced to the size of a arm clock.
But in general, the future includes mixed controls, such as the geographical and language.
- How's that?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this spray dosage?
They say it and at the same time indicate it.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, it would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can provide at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual approach.
I think we will need to work on the development of new types of sensors in the next time, which will allow people to see reactions more accurately.
For example, these can be laser sensors because they offer a good resolution in the depths, which is very important.
- What claims do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it missing resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
However, the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axle.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Man’s movements are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too few, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with a regular processing delay between 1 to 100 millisecond, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machine.
For my work, I just needed a device just without touch control and with more pictures per second.
Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
Kinect is currently working with three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a common RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system in which we could play with different cameras to determine how this helps us in the tridimensional detection of a position.
“When I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of advanced reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in your hand while on the way, but I think: the greatest variant would be a "changing" expanded reality in which we could switch from a cloud to a smartphone via a glass glass,
The glasses are a personal gadget and lies in their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working on virtual objects together with others.
For a while, let’s imagine that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There’s a problem that critics often point to this idea: there’s no sensitive reaction!
The hands do not feel anything at all!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that advanced reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a slightly unusual projection template.
She takes pressure outstanding!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" somewhat hand-resistant, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound rays at a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still as weak as someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also tapes for the hand link that affect the nerve joints in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to overlist the brain?
Do they think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task with which we will still have to fight for a long time, namely to believe a person who is physically in a closed space, he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running bands (not in fitness studios), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far the brain can only be moderate, and there are still many years of work before us.
That’s what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: with many topics we are only at the beginning.
Your own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", which is dedicated to urban residents who form the avantgarde of art and culture.
High-level representatives of the Petersburg art scenes have already landed on the read list, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known to the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagante artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, the red-weared birds that you encounter at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernis cases.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are released, they attract large crowds of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social-philosophical artists of Petersburg who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde in the late 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city, enchanted by his presence in the streets by his fellow citizens smiling in his face and providing good mood with them.
Recently he grabbed a spinning clock and became a Petersburg spinning clock player, since he felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist’s vision, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or Turkish in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as a fashion designer who is dealing with the optics and the image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the gray norm calls out aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you have to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Cultural Palace Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old, but not officially recognized painters ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the paintings of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; of which was created "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was only once ended.
It attracts me to theatre, to fashion, to music, in fact, to everything except literature.
- And all this joined in your kind clinic... - I was important to be at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where the best-created artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a space in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-art club for the Boheme, the house of the Boheme of Petersburg until the renovation.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how thread came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Wire and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing narrow tricks, and among them belonged the famous composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originated in the art clinic.
There our employees and family guests went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press, in which it was the award "Personality of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was interested in the top point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today’s time it’s easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognitable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and prepares for fear to be like that.
In a clown, it loses its tragedy.
I love the greatest, and I have great ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to fully dress.
Now everyone looks at clothes and focuses on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you should not give a man the hand, but you should put him in the face.
The fraud disappears by dressing.
We've recently seen you in the role of the city's Drehorgel player. A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who if I don't?
Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, careful and delicate.
We see the collapse of cultures.
In the past, the people formed large groups: the Bohemia loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Each cult star now has about 100 followers.
- Stas Michailow's appearances come with thousands!
- The left women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people and not 10,000, there is less management, money, and everything goes down.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I painted pictures of a collector even in a series of works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: Spiritual Culture and Consumer Culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, it is something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: Servants of Culture.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
It was different for the real Zarens, because the Zarens might not understand much about culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have those who might be experts, but they will be shut down the path because it needs higher ranking experts who correctly evaluate the first and free them the path.
Now it only counts on its own taste.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they don’t have to accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's for you in Petersburg?
-Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and an appropriate nutritional floor.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutritional floor, for example, because we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
There are many curios people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
This is much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded from subsidies of St. Petersburg City
Birth in the Universe
Earth is in danger.
Earth heating or collision with killerasteroids.
Karawans of spaceships with inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we can plant ourselves in gravity or on the replacement planet?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypothesically.
"Naming Mars and Venus," says the scientists at the astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively living-friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees is on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible in large heights or in the orbit of the Venus, i.e. in all.
The question of reproduction in all was first addressed with regard to the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were conducted.
The fourth generation of crops grown in the orbit did not differ at least from the earthly species.
It followed the seduction of insects, more precisely of small fertile floats (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent into the universe to explore how seriousness affects the development of embryos.
It develops a normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chicken has to be arrested; it has to be able to stand on his legs and begin to move,” explains the laboratory head of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chickens were wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of newborns totally disrupted.
The chickens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we left the chickens climbing and then introduced the whole, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychew to the missing experiment with the chickens in all.
The last cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex species will be found on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into all.
In principle, nothing particular has been found.
“It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued,” said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the space races grew up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are removed from their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is able to think too abstractly and can create a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying all over 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our move fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: does it exceed the space flight?
Will they be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkova, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in the orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, was born a son.
However, there is still a risk.
We have extremely few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
“The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into the orbit,” concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
However, humanity has to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut preparation centre is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a hard state, cosmonauts win routine for work in open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is an alien environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It’s like the little Ichtyander would refuse to testify that life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother’s stomach for about 9 months, and that it can then be used to water easier.
In principle, it is logical, since it just takes 2 weeks from birth to first swimming.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While seriousness for a newborn child is therefore a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of severity, the abdominal and belly muscles become hugely rapidly and thus the ability to push out the child also decreases.
Well, we're going through the baby-leading aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special room to press out the baby.
"But what happens then?" is the unimportant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the ground attraction, the organism cannot form the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be wrapped in the orbit like an adult for training in a burden dress.
He will simply miss what is essential for his life.
“This experiment we conduct together, that is, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled, a totally inconsistent people to the world,” said Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems, RAN.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is just a theory.
But sometime it will become reality when the Earth’s inhabitants in their spaceships break into a remote planet that will become the home for their all-born descendants.
NKÚ Head: Control of the Black System fails by guilt policy
In connection with public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, however, its application falls back.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Panel (Highest Control Authority, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never complete, but it has to be applied correctly - and I think that's not the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar results also appear to have a common control by Czech and German controllers.
As a negative example of practice, he leads the position of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the president of the government, and the control lamb, whose duty is now to control compliance with the law, inhibits its activity,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee of the House of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was it in concrete?
This is a parallel examination we started about two years ago.
In simplicity, it is the European legislation that determines how public procurement can be implemented, which builds up national legislation, and ultimately still exists practical application.
We have all compared this to each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we could find extremely interesting differences; in general, the laws in us may even be a little more "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What does it result from this project?
Such a common control could help us stop trying to continuously improve the laws and reduce and outline thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal exploitation or even criminal acts.
However, reducing thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Maybe it’s even so that we’re loading the system in this way only with excessive "paper cram" and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
With regard to the authorities, the German Pendant to the NKÚ of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to ours, and also has a college which is only formed something different, but the two authorities are basically working similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that these accounts exist also in the individual federal countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds that correspond to our state funds.
Public funds managed with us by the banks and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting heads.
Is the German legislation easier than ours?
In general, I would compare this with no concrete information, however, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all.
Maybe that's because the auditors are better there?
That’s not true, but as I said, I don’t really like such comparisons.
To this end, it should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also faced with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn’t have anything about cooperation with our authority, wouldn’t they?
As regards the Czech legislation, which has been important for your authority to renew the procurement law, do you already feel any impact?
Given the fact that this novelle is only in force for a short period of time, it has not yet effected in our tests.
Since our controls are subsequently carried out, we need to expect a certain delay here.
If we have more impacts in the preparatory phase of future controls, then we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of the risks of insolvency" and examined and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public procurement, this will, of course, affect the changes, as the threshold values, the conditions for certain types of tenders have changed.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, there may be a problem that the rules will become "stringer" and can no longer be followed.
Under the previous rules, persons undergoing an audit against the carrier (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are responsible for any non-compliance with the procurement law of an infringement of the budgetary discipline.
Is it then meaningful to make the law even more strict?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the decision making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let’s say which way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not welcome entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the controller whose duty is now to control the compliance of the law in its activities.
He can say, “We change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we do it as if nothing were.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is also appropriate for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the provider is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be complete, but it must be applied correctly - and that's what I think is missing in us.
On the streets, united ice sheets rule, but they are mostly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there are some snow and ice sheets.
However, mainly the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible this morning, combined dominated snow and ice spots.
The temperatures fall to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it is supposed to be a bit warmer.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the deeper heights only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the hills of the Erzberg.
According to the District Strategy Guard, a limited vision was ruled for nebula.
The R6 and the first-class road roads in the region are currently totally accessible.
However, for example, attention is given to bridges on which roads are sometimes required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third highways, including mountainways, are also accessible.
However, on these roads there remains separately required or exited snowboards.
More attention is therefore given in particular in the higher layers.
Districts of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some East Bohmen roads there is a danger because of ice sheets, in higher layers and in the mountains, there is sometimes still an outstanding layer of snow on the streets, the road and highway direction shares on their websites.
The road masterpieces warn drivers against ice sheets, which can occur in particular in higher layers in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, it can be reached on roads of the second and third-class roads in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the Riesengeberg and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An outstanding layer of snow is located in heights on the streets of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov circles.
In East Bohemian, it is mostly sunny or warmer today, and it remains mostly free of precipitation.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The streets in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but locally, increased attention is given, and the driving method is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has previously snowed and the temperatures subsequently fell, it can come to ice glaciers on the roads.
Locally, it is also to be expected with nebula, but the vision will improve throughout the day.
This information is derived from the district streets.
The highway D5 is practically fully accessible, but increased attention is recommended between the 80th and 131km.
The roadways of the first road class are mostly dry but frozen.
Nevertheless, in the south of the circles of Pils and Tachov, ice sheets can be cut off.
The roadways of the second and third highways are moisture, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also here.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Olomouc District
Today, snow mattresses have to calculate drivers who are traveling towards the elevations in Olomouc district.
After the use of stream vehicles, snowmatch remains on the Pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snowing forced the road masterpieces to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road management, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the roads are mostly fully accessible.
"In the circle Šumperk remains still snowerest in the heights.
On the Pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to wait for snowmatch in the direction of Jeseník,” said Šumperk, an employee of the road management, to the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník circle also had to go out at night, according to their statements, the streets to the heights are free and wet after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are completely accessible, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must be careful to drive in forest sections as the roads are still wet here.
Usti nad Labem District, Liberec District
In North Bohmen, road masterpieces report several poorly accessible street sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is closed in the district of Ústí n.K., according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain in deeper layers below zero, so snow and ice will be kept on the roads. From the depths, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice sheet is reported in particular from the district of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and the road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported to have bad traffic conditions.
The shutdown of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to the easts, which were pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think will happen in less than a month of the world’s decline?
This is one of those disaster messages that we like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make it more fun and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s collapse.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world’s decline.
Can you present our readers the project more closely?
This is a country-wide benefit event that we have planned for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is predicted for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20th, three concerts will take place simultaneously from 21:00 a.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert is about at the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island Kiribati, located in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who comes from this idea?
Originally from me, we then developed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world’s decline, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once transfer this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key stickers against the world’s decline, which can also help us with buying them via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other interpreters, also recorded the so-called hymn against the world crash, entitled "World crash falls out".
Today, the hymn is very popular on YouTube. Will it also get rid of the benefits concerts?
Of course, in the end, provided that everything is going on and the world’s decline does not take place...
The hymn is to be singed at the same time by all interpreters on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns will be transmitted live together in a direct stream from the Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, as well as Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech culture scene, which is related to the realization of many beneficial events and concerts...
We strive to intensively engage these people in our projects.
It has proved that most of us are interested in cooperation with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the performance of the concerts against the world’s decline?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational studio, we have been working with the Tap Association at Jedlička Institute for six years.
Students of Jedlička Institute are regularly administered by lecturers who help them in various leisure activities.
Since students themselves don’t have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
Within the framework of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building will be created which we will then enter with this project.
There are several groups and interpreters in each concert.
Which criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to create a program that matches all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “great events” also planned for the future?
In May, we will first attend the Prague Spring, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to attend the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we were already in the United States - would also like to connect this with events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not small, so far you have already arrived in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group that consists of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these travels logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchairs, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room, and we also, of course, have to join many instrument bags and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always succeeded without any problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes have been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of how it looks like in individual countries with barrier freedom, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were witnesses just in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the east.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled; it is still unusual when someone is on the road alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious that there is a wheelchair in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to retrieve towards the further developed countries?
There are lots of things that we hang behind...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation still depends on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just usual that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events there, in which we are a bit forward with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and barrier freedom is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series, things will really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I began as a career at Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with a little intensely.
And since I myself am a musician and plays Saxofon, I founded a music-AG with a colleague.
Well, and with time, what our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, has to say is something out of control (laughs).
But the band has been known only in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to promote actively for ourselves.
We have become aware that when something is done and it is not to be seen outwardly, our own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential that you could handle things differently.
In the show business today, one is often copying one another.
This is logical in its way, because everything is considered new with caution and is accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer mostly has is, of course, compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely overflowing because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who live a full-time life and can develop, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things, and you must also demand some discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have samples twice a week, they have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm is lost with many quickly.
This is how it works everywhere, in any band that works seriously and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Ice cream Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, we can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcomed with us.
Finded instead of the day before the predicted world crash, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 21:00
Event locations are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three events are finally connected by live circuit, and it sounds like a common interpretation of the hymn "Weltfall falls out" of the band The Tap Tap.
The goal of the concert is to provide funds for the establishment of a multifunctional educational centre for disabled persons, which should be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age for free, tickets are available on pre-selling at Bohemiatite.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was adopted as the twenty-eighth member of this space agency at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Organization (ESA) member states last week. Poland is the second member state of the former East Block (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on November 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The journey of Poland into space began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were engaged in spacecraft, thus not always shooting on understanding.
For example, I remember the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Enter to the cosmonaut".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (d. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Nobel Prize REP-Irish founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and spacecraft.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis’ globally recognized contribution to the development of spacecraft was awarded, among other things, by the designation of one of the craters on the landed side of the moon.
In 1925, a railroad was built in Poland, for which a missile drive was planned.
The author of the project and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
This information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began dealing with missile-driven shootings.
The research was conducted by the Institut Mobilka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents delivered, it is evident that research has progressed until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the intervention of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the special press of Ing. Rohoziński's design of a photoelectric hunting rocket appeared, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda Luftna i missile bomb lotnicza" appeared by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects addressed the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was ended from the beginning of the war.
Other articles on spacecraft appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which the four extensive articles of space space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that the exploration of space would have the future.
In its early 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA attempted to join the 1951-found International Space Federation, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation for Space Transport.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum air height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began in the Błędów-West flight tests with the two-level rocket RM-2.
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the RM-34 missile should reach a height of up to 14.5 km and be used for observation of height winds.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM missiles was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as two-stage missiles, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
These missiles have developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missiles had a transport space with 0.4 liters of version capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum height was 37 km for all three types.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 missiles were developed at the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, following the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
In 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic’s Vladimír Remek.
The repealing of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court rejected the law on non-profit works.
This decision raised a vibrant debate in the public.
It is definitely interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The cause of this is the principle of free trade and of the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which is hand in hand with rapid financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (savings), there are price tensions.
Under this term, it is understood a condition in which the manufacturer seeks to remain in economic competition by importing favorable goods by "offering" competition, in order to crash a larger market share on himself and increase its profits.
In a large scale, this means for most companies to invest or buy their production abroad in a low cost, or to give up their business, which is a result of high unemployment in countries with comparatively high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear any responsibility for unemployment caused by it, state expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are overflowing at this point.
The unprecedented practice of private capital in individual economies creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly expressed in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs to one by economic force in long-term unemployment, and to the other by circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between arm and empire.
There have been public food taxes in Germany for several years for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people involved is already in millions.
The increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly occurring in cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures will certainly run out of the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic breakdown of their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or for a hunger wage at the edge of society, hoping that private capital will flow in land.
The question is, naturally, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty goes from one country to another; or the capital remains equal, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state should not participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital remains closely in its position that the State should not interfere in the economy.
But then you need to wonder whether private capital does not affect politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the unique answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual privilege, legislation, in which almost everything is strict, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a state ministry lacks private, closely involved legal companies in the development of bills.
These bills will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions announce, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the Liberal Democracies have now quickly entered a situation as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Emperor and Pompey: "The state has long been caught in destruction, and the officials were occupied with violence.
Contrary to sharp money, by unlawful ease of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew inherently, and the people went to the election with already purchased voices ... "People with character did not stand for officials, so the state had no consulate as a result of this fall for eight months" ... "You really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was strongly alone, but all the Democratic hero was there was a strong rule, and then the man was elected by C...
As it appears, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the unprecedented preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to social interests.
Private capital is not, by its nature, able to recognize and implement the benefit of the whole society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decade of elites who are not in the least seeking deepening reforms.
The cause of the emergence of fascism and communism, therefore, we have to look for the unprecedented liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s state, the decline of these regimes in favour of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already celebrated.
Especially disasterful is the fact that today’s elites face the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the old and newer history, in perfect ignorance.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least no permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken monopoly of private capital in society.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"... that nothing is derived from violence, or could ever be derived," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in refrain is: "... so that we don't forget how broken we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, there would be no one,” says the deadly Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with which the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and call the State Israeli terrorists.
I do not want to write about who in these constantly recurring waves of the murderer and who are victims; in the end, the present-day inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, have entered the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
I am concerned with opening the view of the readers behind the cults, the view of whose 95-year tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) is mainly serving in the small flat country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and come from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influence the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
At any time, we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less likely is the question of whether they were really always those personalities themselves that set their steps autonomously, or whether someone behind their throne was directed to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it is not created within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a particularly prominent one that can be called the head of the crack (I don’t know if someone else stands over them, but I don’t exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much will be written about them.
Obviously.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the connection of their name with high criminal acts, in the background of which it always stood the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they are waring or equiping them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, only four remaining after the collapse of Gaddafi, while Russia has undergone its government of the central bank of Russia in the meantime).
Anyone who has tried to deal with this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to release his own (speaking state) banknotes during the Civil War and was killed in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to release his own banknotes and wanted to remove the FED - he was killed in 1963; deputy Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED of solving the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschild’s global power lusts in 1859 – 1871 led to the formulation of a plan for the creation of three world wars by Albert Pik, a 33th free-mayor, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The First War was intended to eliminate the great monarchistic states of Europe, in particular by the Second War, the colonial rule of Britain should be broken, and the Third War would reduce the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number like this would not lead to their convenience and their luxury) and, in turn, absolutely, it would not continue to consume as many resources as universal.
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the solution of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (or from chaos - order from chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to worsening the situation (see the founding of the FED so that crises like those caused by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the assassination of the Habsburger's successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo had managed to launch the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zaren Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfunded capitalization of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zaren Empire was no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers were able to create a latent conflict situation through politics by imposing Germany with giant war repairs; thus they created the prerequisite of poor military masses, so that they only had to rebuild the Germans a sufficiently strong commander of a function; they also had to rebuild the facts, and they also had to rebuild the facts.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (Rückkehr to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it came to the first collision with the inhabited Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler went out of the chain that the international bankers had initially held, or whether everything was running as planned, it is hard to estimate, in any case the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps made the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the defeat of the State of Israel represents the creation of the fire point for the Third World War.
If international bankers manage to defeat this war, the Jewish people will become the victim of the first battle line, this time along with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (they only think about how people are sharply divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes infinity in an endless spiral of violence, with initially the jealousy of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, will only choose their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal politician to international banks, who can do everything in order to double a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership worldwide in Shanghai, could run over 20% of the world's road economy (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) and soon to control over a global conflict.
In what light appears the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: “The only thing we need is a all exciting crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their conception, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which each newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to subject this being to total control.
And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, and rich and free, and slaves, to receive a mark on their right hand, or on their foreheads, that no one may sell it, that they may receive the mark of the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding considers the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student demonstrating occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as prisoners.
For their release, they demanded the release of the falling Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way for the U.S. government to get out of this situation - she couldn't let herself throw the shah overboard as this would have massively damaged the confidence of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable in Iran, where the revolution initiated the establishment of a theocratic regime, to implement the release of the prisoners.
It was a severe strike for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt of gender liberation made everything even worse.
The detained diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were passed by the Algerian government.
The fate of the prisoners emphasized at home a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iran moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actress Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six embassy employees escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA managed to bring refugees out of Iran in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, helping them to cover their true identity – they travelled with Canadian passports as members of a film recording that was claimed to be visiting in Drehorte for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by "Exfiltration" experts, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood collaboration.
In order to become credible, articles on this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck film is a special combination of several genres of films.
On the one hand, he is a realistic polittriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the Ocean's Eleven film.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on one side the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are displayed iconic contemporary photographs, and in the film making of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the lonely passports from Hollywood, which are therefore ironically and easily overwhelming.
And then there are still scenes from the CIA and other institutions - men in dresses at the meeting table, on the officials, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has successfully restarted his career with this film.
From a smiling actress, he has become a respectable actress, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third film after Crime No Child Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it’s the first Afflecks film that doesn’t play in the home of the director’s Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that captured the previous films of this director from the Hollywood standard.
However, Affleck proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the entry sequence of the message’s initial emotion is very impressive in their transparency, yet transmitting the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film loss on a bass in Tehran).
Too much action in many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
With the fewer, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality - which does not always act so elegantly (the scenes where the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is removed from a phone call in America, or even the chasing trail on the start path, acts somewhat artificially).
The weakness of Argo is its too widespread streaming, which is due to the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are not alone in the film.
The Affleck film loses somewhat of traction. It is a film that you can follow with some interest and gout the design and the retro style of a thriller from the 1970s.
However, enthusiasm only makes it difficult.
However, as a reminder of a somewhat alive piece of history to this day, and as a proof of how the concepts of all-powerful and all-knowledge secret services are covered, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the inflation of air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which initiates an annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, decided this year to organize the competition "The Most absurd Regulation or Idea from the EU Workstate".
"On this idea, the plan recently introduced by the EU to introduce a women's 40% rate in the management of major European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is concerned about the organization of this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
For example, among the nominated absurdities is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance rates for men and women.
To that end, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Any further incredible accidents from the EU work state can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013,” he said.
The controversial EU regulations include, inter alia, the binding of bioethanol to naturally damaging fuels, the prohibition of reliable cheese silver thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or the Directive on the size of chicken poultry due to the essential eggs this year.
In the past, criticism also collected the actual ban on the use of the term "buttering" or also the ban on the sale of conventional lights.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU appliance often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and should not have "coating oil".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonize the unified national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards for fruit and vegetables have already been rejected by the EU against the resistance of some countries, noting that the previous directives would lead to a deprivation of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation from last year, which, according to air balloons, has to be provided with the notice that children under eight years of age should not be allowed to blow the air balloon without an adult’s supervision.
The EU urged an American study, which, according to airballons, was the leading cause of the child’s injury.
A similar restriction is already applicable to children under 14 years of age when using annual market strains.
Curious accidents are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official role in the EU should not use the name FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) due to the sensitivity of the theme for Greece.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the former absurdities, the EU Regulation on the extent of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU established the highest priority of food stocks that would be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the quantity set for mushroom conservation, which threatened us with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or the idea of granting funds for applications for funds.
These ideas originated not from Brussels but from Prague.
“We are disadvantageous because we don’t have a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement at the EU,” said in autumn 2004 of the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state warehouses were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organized a tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
Grants for grant applications offered the municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should specifically be funded for the establishment of grant applications in Brussels.
EU: Strange regulations are the exception
In the Member States, however, regulations are slightly targeted by criticism, but some experts believe that the EU’s efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve more recognition.
One more serious problem, according to these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced in the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products, and this struggle does not always win.
Although the Czech Republic, after a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, could defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the indigenous space (Tuzemský rum) whose tradition returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it to "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products made of sugar pipe distillate, not for products made of sugar rubber.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lubecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinkens are now available as well as the Karlsbader Zwieback, the karp of Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the pardubicer can breastfeed or the Hořicer roles.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how do you get the idea of applying for the President's office?
I don’t care about being a senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without any problems, I wouldn’t apply anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been flooded for 20 years, how the thieves are circulating freely, while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something I don’t like, then I’m trying to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I’m over 40, and I’m independent and partial, I don’t have any other way to influence things than to apply for the office of a senator or the president.
You got it in the Senate and then went straight into the castle.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I have told myself all the time that I will take the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I precised this and said that I will be nominated for the Chairman's office, if I will be elected to the Senate.
But my goal is not the function, but the function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate as possible.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a people, shine in the knife and in front of the TV, but that we humiliate everyone who wants to change something.
These are the media that want to steal honor and confuse freedom of expression with freedom.
For example, I was argued that I would be a journalist or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with recurring asset declarations of over 20 million krones.
To do this, you have to change the laws.
As President, you have no competences in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I was committed to keeping the travel guide a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the small-spiritual policy - if someone comes from right or from left with a good proposal, this is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent party isolator, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without thinking of shadowblades and party dogms of any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather than right or left?
From the Czech point of view, people seem to see me more left.
But for me, this right-left thought is absolutely unimportant.
It is important for me to move forward.
I don’t care whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also address bad ideas.
I miss you when someone calls you popularist.
But do you not confirm that by what you just said?
If you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And you want to get closer to that.
This can be called Populism for me, but all the suggestions I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament, you only have tags.
And so you are not far away in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in carrying out material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally enforce material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the complaints should then say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that indicates misconceptions can put pressure on the political scene.
Only once take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I am clearly saying that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it fails, then I will return to the private sector in six years.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I haven’t achieved anything alone, so I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they don’t want to be nominated for the Senate.
I talked to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in trade with light heating oil.
My candidateship started with the condition that people are deeply unhappy, but now I’m no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the election at all, and those who have gone are mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
We are only two independent in the Senate.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the Mayors and District Chiefs.
Do you think about the establishment of your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the past of each potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about asset statements, how do you look like yours?
My private property is estimated at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few more on the account.
The Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond always liked how he was driving in the car, was galant to women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive a Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the Republic, but you don’t want your own money to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t wake up too much interest.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign from my own resources.
The expenses for the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live alone from the Senator’s content; for example, I couldn’t finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't apply for anything.
So are you still working as an entrepreneur to have your outcome?
Didn't you say you're going to go back to these activities?
But this does not relate to the amount of wage.
As I promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my Deputy Representative will be the director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live from something.
What monthly income did you get used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
However, as a president, I would completely suspend my undertakings.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects demonstrate that true adventures are not just in the head - for example by Spijkenisse and the newly built office hostel - 2 Photos
“I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a traveller on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But it's beautiful, it's already the house."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is going to volunteer to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a rarely visited sleeping city in front of the Rotterdam Gates, is a record holder.
The 80,000 resident community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the generalization and to build the seven fictional bridges presented on the euro bills as beautifully pinned steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive remained in the boundaries.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library should come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the great bark charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual relaxation and appeared to the competition-Hearing anno 2003 with five books under arm and a grince in the face.
And while the jury still distorted looking around and climbed with the axis, the french Maas stacked his readiness to bring the size to a pyramid and ended his action-made speech with the words "Love city community!"
That is why he is my proposal for the book hostel of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro costly mountain has been lifted up.
It is part of a revitalization project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent housing and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the book hostel was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town restaurant, which had not yet been offered as a post-modern pedestrian zone and a fascist destiny, behind white facades, would tend to suspect a milk factory to become richer in a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public culture building in the history of his existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: bookeldorado under cheese clocks.
Although there is an elevator that leads in the middle of the mountain massiv, the real space and reading pleasures end up with the footing of the topography.
The round-glossed interior is bright and transparent, the burning climbing floor and the elegant street lights speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at Parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Usually, the libraries stand along the façade, and in the middle is a large, dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonalized,” says Winy Maas.
We have placed the classic room configuration on the head and gestured the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the bouquet hostel is used: in the center are offices, internet library, shack club, environmental center and home technology centers.
A special joy is the black books, which are wall-coated, breastfeeding, scratching.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even meat architects and engineers sweat the head of the unknown construction material.
“We wanted to work with recycling materials here,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the city community Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so, one day in a Friesland farm, we have been struggling with an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
In the Netherlands for many years, a thin millimeter plastic sheet has been used in greenhouses and on fields as a root sheet.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is mature for the lock mill.
For the library, the vlies - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeter thick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called landbouwplastic (KLP) is coloured into a dark, homogenous, loadable material that smells a bissel to new cars and a bissel to sports schuh.
After 105 degrees, the summit was reached.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long hiking, you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and pinned ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but especially the proper moisture in the literary mountain.
Donation for the New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house is a project in pointo ecology despite the many glass surfaces,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with ground heat.
Although the bouc hostel is under a glass break, the sun appears only shortly inside in sunny days.
The broad wooden limbs, which stand around the glass fasce, serve as an excavation and take off a large part of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest perform fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already watched the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the bookberg as a "large overwhelming soul" of Spikenisse.
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This will first fill the optical gaps in the yet not fully filled library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has emerged.
The reels are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-leather library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the cattle.
This is why MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called the Identity Foundation of the Professional Jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote literature history.
She likes to be young and unfamiliar too.
This is finally a point of approach to identity.
Sabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany has participated in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in U.S. European relations, Berlin balances this at a narrow degree of diplomatic degree.
German Wave: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for a Palestinian observer status in the United Nations.
And then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Germany has to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held the vote when it came to the establishment of a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it just turns its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the U.S. to a German foreign policy.
It is swearing that Europeans have no coherent and coherent policy.
The Germans are then recovering between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the UK.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to hit the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t like to take too much weight, that’s not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by taking into account important votes, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I don’t think this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as international players and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S. has expressed itself for a veto.
Is there a difference between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American internal policy, these varieties have always existed.
I believe that the government, under Obama, has secretly a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position in public, of course.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanjahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to deal with its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and consistent European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a broader line and instead need to move things out of their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This isn’t easy for Germany, it’s because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Germany itself looks like an important international player – does Germany want to take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still have tough leadership?
Germany is still not used to it, which is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn’t make it easy for the Germans.
This is the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the U.S. influence on European policy is steadily declining, but the EU is not filled with this vacuum at the moment, who else is there?
The Germans will just have to play a larger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's uncomfortable to them, and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and politicians from Europe and North America together investigate the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Marke Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
A name that is officially registered in China is hidden behind it, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, she enjoys protection as long as the real name donors do not complain.
And even then it is unclear if they get right.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in defence law violations in Fernost.
Every week there is a new case on my desk.
The followers have a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
This is how Lu-Gucci will simply be made from Gucci, instead of Prada you will be allowed to insert Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artist named named after the Ermenegildo Zegna Fashion House.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the major cities, there are multi-storey sales houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeit.
But Pattloch’s cases are different: In the name of his customers, he assumes that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a coach brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means that women are fishing rich men.
Chinese authorities are not conscious of guilt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is evaporated, the setting alone disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial failures and process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially with expensive preview products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing, with a volume of €15 billion per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years the procedure can be withdrawn with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court has demonstrated complaints because after the long duration of the alleged name has become "market reality".
If the complainant has a pech, he should even pay the plagiator money because he injured its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle is here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese can use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star until now.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore who left the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of their guilt.
The brand name CTMO in Beijing acknowledges that there were shortages in 2010 due to too low staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, you have returned from the “earth situation in the course of work to normality”.
Thus, the stock of unprocessed objections has decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still waiting for completion in the office.
To deal with it is a lot
As often as in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million brand protection applications were submitted at CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and indicates that China will run the list of new applications for the tenth time in the world, the Authority reports.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were charged.
Simplified means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the contrary, it costs a number of times, as the case of German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was removed.
However, the follower continued to ensure the Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You have lost this because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand name CTMO also showed the objection of the Munichers.
Although Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, the opponent continues to fight until today.
You need to be careful
The case is now attached to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely excited and it takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly clear that the company’s archive even had to review hundred years old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the counterpart a "high six-numeral euro" for settlement.
“You see how much it’s worth,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the distance are even threatening to return to Europe.
In fact, if the imitators secure unprotected brands there.
This is how a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long abandoned the company, yet he was able to derogate the registration.
“You have to be careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It’s not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should “register everything that is somehow protective even in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand dramas, then you must pay the opposite license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pulled out of the market in the questionnaire segment.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi tests - and in Swasiland, AIDS is happy with it.
The history of a connection that surpasses more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there’s the stamping: cowboy shoes, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men’s lippers are looking for the takt on the park floor, quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly blow - old, bass, tenor, and sopran - disturbed and persecuted.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, almost pulls it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his soft wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, Chor Imbongi tests a new song.
There were fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every chorstimme has a different text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swasiland.
Help for self-help
There are around 34 million HIV infections worldwide, estimating Unaids, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS residents.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS travelers in the village of Esitjeni, the Association has found Voices for Africa Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or even praise prizes.
The bandit language can speak fluently, but no one can sing in this room.
For almost ten years, the Chor has used songs in this foreign soft language and brings them down and back to where they originated: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German chorus.
40 percent are infected
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leather and straw cabins, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are infected with the HI virus.
In Estonia, there is a small, all over Swasiland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of male skin, which proves to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swasiland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not rare.
During a common trip to Africa in spring 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but above all, Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school graduation, there is no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
However, a year later, the Chor founded the Association "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally concerned with the AIDS vaccines in Estonia.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomas, herpes genitals or hepatitis.
Fill leathers and leathers are part of the parasite STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are mainly present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydien infections, trichomonades, candidoses (pilz), tripper and human papilloma viruses are commonly sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is comparatively low - however: about 20 percent of HIV new infections belong to this group.
In adolescents, chlamydien infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European reports, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged between 15 and 25 years.
In addition, human papilloma viruses are common in adolescents.
How did the number of infections evolve?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Cook Institute, the number of Syphilis infections increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints in urination, outbreak, under abdominal pain, as well as bladders or vessels.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because, in part, stimulants of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by mushroom infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis, most STIs can be healed and late traces can be avoided.
Through patents, donations, and not last the gages that the chore is extinguing across Germany, there are many things that come together.
"We have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confidence and executive woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares that the wools are well undergoing, for example, one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 waves with them, give them a roof over their head and make sure that children in their uniforms appear at time every day at school.
Anyone who has no more comes to the protective house of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid equally by the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has launched a nursing school, built two chicken houses and organized with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not a self-confidence, because the disease is so obvious throughout the country, you are silently loved to die.
A King with 14 Wives
“Aids is an absolute tabu,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it is strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamia instead of democracy.
It is also due to this state-sanctioned lifestyle that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers carrying the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
“Culture is another – meat to flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Chor travels every two or three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of cheerfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know in the southern summit of the black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has already removed some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patent children.
Even though the small village is hardly found on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the staggering singers in the probe room on Bergheimer Street, you can also see it shining there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Merkur
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is Merkur Ice on the planet.
The ice coating may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. Space Agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although it is nearby to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published in the journal “Science” on Thursday.
The sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently in the shadow region of the planet.
It is intended to be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that were hit on the mercure.
But no one brings the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet,” said Sean Solomon, the chief scientist of the Messenger Sonde.
The temperature on the merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building stones of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unrecognized by Earth citizens, sondages, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are working to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small holes in infinite width.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who circles behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This image cut of an infrared recording of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless star generations: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink "new-borns" in the star circle.
This star-depicting region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This shiny glance of a dead star has taken up NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that has accelerated the star in the death process.
In the gigantic triphyde nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are produced from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galaxy's birth stage.
The Plejaden Starhaufen, also known as "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the only eye.
However, with the telescope, the colors are better validated.
Like a red age, the helix nebula faces the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity with a earthly continent brought this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color environment.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the top telescope.
Saturn and his rings: how these emerged is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn Month, which has disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and hardest recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become real artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Weather shows the multi- thousand light-year-old trifid nebula in the star image shield.
The name Trifid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three, three-parts), as dark dust stripes the bright heart of the star-born place are three-parts.
In the star image of the dragon carriers, astronomers have photographed the predecessors of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are racing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who does not have technical abbreviations may call them the Southern Fire Bike at its top name.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the Irisnevel in the star image Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year nebula is made up of dust corns, which are ten to hundred times smaller than usual house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way is located in this star noble.
The star star is always producing new youngsters.
Also, these star wolves, associated with the Rosetten Nebel, are constantly producing new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspected that it was created only shortly after the original, as it was found mostly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Insights into All: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey – even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasing – and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, i.e. from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world’s largest remote tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows views in all equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
However, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantages of favorable construction: the telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby-eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height corner.
Its particularity: the high light collection force.
This, despite a relatively small mirror diameter, is sufficient to reach the world’s largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to all for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can assist by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Star Wars (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is intended to cover 42 meters and be composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
With pictures, however, it is expected at the beginning of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equally two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks into the sky alongside them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, gigantic telescope will be created - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a surprise on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions of all are the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already been providing pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets – primarily for those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the latest launch preparations on the Kepler Space Telescope are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot at the beginning of 2018 on board an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists believe that there exists on the South Pole of Merkur Ice too.
However, there is no reliable data for this as the Messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Bicycle dimensions have been indicating for decades that there is on the ice merkur.
Through the 2004 Messenger sonde launched – the first to turn around the merkur – the scientists now have certainty.
Drink butter every day - and 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace in the country where 97-year-olds are relatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains is called wild-dromatic.
The small bus runs through the curved street, passing through densely forested hills, rising rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here is the Caucasian people group of the Talians, of which it is not very well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijan and is very durable.
End station is Lerik.
The small town continues with too beautifully rated architecture from Soviet times that doesn’t like to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too complaining is the arrival of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, because the road is only one-stop.
The pronounced wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the goods for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival here of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozens of talyshes from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born
However, the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Müslümov, who is expected to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Muslim’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The husband had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he must have had another daughter.
So did Shirali Muslim Mov count for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the seniors in Central Asia.
"There are also many high-age people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "a lot of very old men live in Sardinia too."
However, due to lack of documents, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially since there is no personal status record.
Every day swallowed butter
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach Bible age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many people live here in the south?
Aserian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
The museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the diet.
However, calculating the calorie-rich diet of the talics should be so healthy that it loves meat, bread, and especially milk products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, from nutritional point of view does not seem just plausible.
Or is it the original lifestyle that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near Lerik city, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground with a butterflies that untiredly pushes and rolls her.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two little children also jump around.
The kitchen serves the tea, which is served in the typical, perfume-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly standing in pure and limb, under her head towel she hides long dark-blooded soups that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
“I never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly retirement is enough for life
She has always eaten only what came from her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
All my life I haven’t bought food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was after World War II.
But everything became better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, is hardly aware of borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003, he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the Ruder.
After all, there is no nose among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euro) receives Mirzayeva monthly as a retirement, for these circumstances a amount from which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayeva has long taken his son right: "The old people enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Competitive customer relationships in Cairo reveal the profound split of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as a basis is strongly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds, it is in my responsibility, in front of the people and in front of God," he said in public television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, but mostly to the Christian captains, the Liberals, the clear Muslims and the Seculars.
Because all of them, so far unexpectedly broken down in a confusion opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a godly state on the Nile of the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has, as Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, temporarily circumcised the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competences "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer really wants to save a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California is about the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judiciary be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were trapped through the 100-headed constitutional assembly, dominated by the Islamist, in a nightly, 15-hour parforce rite, are partially worried.
As in previous constitutions, it is stated in the draft that the practice of justice is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is an interpretation case, and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the sophisticated formulation and the associated legal playground for a rigorous interpretation of the Sharia.
This puts at least a newly added article: in all matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiation power in the entire Sunni Islam, must be drawn.
It does not have to, but it can mean that spirituality supervises the law, which would de facto have resulted in the dismantling of the judiciary.
A lot in the constitutional draft is an interpretation case
Also problematic: Civil military justice is to continue.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositionists.
After the collapse of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military jail.
The State should also, according to the draft, "protect the true beings of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values".
This is so legally formulated that government institutions can even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censorship.
However, no article expressly states the equality between men and women.
For this purpose, another prohibits the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers to insult or deceive.
But what a reproach is, and how it should be declared, remains unclean.
Dubios also encourages the formulation that is forbidden by the "protection of humans".
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal teacher?
As much as in the draft, the Mursi is present to be signed and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the supremacy of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual opinion on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to death before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential election leader.
Peace Nobel Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution belongs to the "mullberg of history".
Through Twitter, he urged the followers of Mursis to lead a "putch against democracy".
"When he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and hit him," oppositional Jasser Said said.
“We are not tired, the blood of our brothers has not been drunk yet,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood, however, went to the demonstration, not on the Tahrir square, but on a mass prayer on the other Niluf in front of the University of Cairo.
Many hidden women and followers of the Salafists took part and shouted, "This people requires the application of the law of God."
They said to Mursi, “Let the land be cleansed.” They said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have sworn to civil war-like conditions.
Mursis’ followers obviously didn’t want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers said that both the opponents of the constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time for the people to decide in what direction the country should go.
A majority of the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should include all social forces.
The 48-year-old prosecutor and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers while sitting in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world views, but because human rights are incomparable for him.
For this he was imprisoned, convicted, and imprisoned.
"And now the word for human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in a conversation with the World on Sunday.
Mursi's exhibit of power on all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are eclatant violations of democratic gambling rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto put them out of force," Saeda complains.
Without civil society organizations, a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels lonely, even from the international community, which looks at the ideological direction fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That might be a matter of fact.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns, “You build a monster that you can’t control anymore.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million residents of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe but all over the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with local appetite on pretty malicious fish?
Take a selection of over-mature cheese varieties.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And shake them there for a week.
You need to imagine the nasal smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this harsh smell in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-trained forella, which - depending on how stinking your fish would like - is fermented in water for up to one year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather becomes colder, the Norwegians flow to a feast here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really extremely prominent specialty.
"You eat raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fireplace, but also organizes the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk-General".
People around us eat small fish snakes and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rak fish," Havard says.
Spiritually, the smell can dilute.
I'll cost a few chickens.
If you avoid bringing the rack fish near the nose, it is not bad - such as sushi, which has a pretty long bus trip behind you.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, since there were no cooling opportunities yet, and fish was drunken in air-resistant salt water bottles in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and, without doubt, consumed feelings pumped by alcohol.
Thousands of Norwegians seemed to be forced to leave their country and mostly wander into the United States in search of work.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a growing labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not long ago much richer than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, although strictly huge part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich is proudly cost 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to disturb it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik in the name - those racist right-wing extremists, which last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, only refers to the "crash of July 22".
The Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peaceful country is able to do such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for Norway’s current wealth has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason why we’re going so well,” says Anna, our killer girl, distributing round tablets with mature rack fish, and with her long blonde hair and the stealing blue eyes, encompassing the Nordic ideal.
We are - as said - a careful people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We aren't very attractive, we don't like cheerleading.
Norway has been very careful with its oil supply – a large part of the industry’s income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years until the World Economic Crisis, everyone was thrown around with money they did not possess at all, Norway kept its stock exchanges firmly closed.
“As long as we can hike in the winter and walk in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And, of course, eating rack fish," she adds with a laughter.
I stand in the snow and plead for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an elch bourgeois is definitely something different. The juicy meat can help me.
But in the evening, the cake is back on the dining plan.
The hotel in which I lodge is one of several events that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV channel to a flying showmaster surrounded by rackfisk plates.
The speculation is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What point do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You climb and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinness of the whole fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto
While Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant by the BBC analyzes the challenges he’s faced and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a constantly distorted city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that shut down several important traffic routes into the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
However, the goal was not to disturb Pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new President Enrique Pena Nieto will be elected as president and will take over the nation’s leadership.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the separation government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country has been under a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people’s lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week at the Oval Office to U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before heading up with the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country in Mexico.
In this tightly occupied, extensive part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A Direct Man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember it.
The residents of the resort are assigned to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that made Pena Nieto build and which represent a great improvement in comparison to the dirty, humble roads that once had been here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political allied Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as Congress Deputy for the party Pena Nietos, who works for the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and economics, we hope to have an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was dismissed in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congress Deputy Olvera admits that the party, after 12 years outside the Los Pinos Presidency Palace, gives Enrique Pena Nieto great expectations.
The allegations of the opposition, the new president, lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent state-owned man, especially he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast could not be larger to the pinched streets of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and represents a predecessor of Mexico City itself in many ways.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was enacted to fight the drug bands operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly urgent problem.
In the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone on a spot near a large waste pony.
During the period of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico - a statistic that exceeds even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for their violence and murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least failed to address the problem of women's murder during his office.
In the worst case, however, his government closed his eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the downstairs, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was killed by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed to have washed her body," recalled Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body stars had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, it is placed next to a cross, carrying a single word: justice.
This is what the family has been rejected so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a spokesman, a disturbance doctor, a Norwegian.
You want to simply accept your judgment and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and distortions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto takes office on Saturday, he also takes a large responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been dismissed by violence in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem in particular during his office.
"I hope he is as president as he was governor," PRI Congress Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo said.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are worried most about that.
Prosecutor Bradley Manning hasn't complained about wrongdoing
The Prosecutor Against Bradley Manning's Prosecution of Incarceration
The hearing addresses Manning’s time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defence strives to withdraw the accusation due to harsh detention conditions
The U.S. Army is accused of having removed thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor tried on Friday to find that the armed man-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain about the allegedly suffered crime in military jail.
In a crossing interview with Mannings during a preliminary hearing in M. Meade, Maryland, May Ashden Fein stated that the documents for weekly visits made by Mannings prisoners during the nine-month period of detention in Quantico, Virginia did not have any complaints about his treatment.
One day before the crossroads, which was held as a result of a defence request to reject the charges - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the hard detention period - had said Manning had considered the suicide in prison.
The U.S. military secret service analyst, arrested in June 2010, is alleged to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fin and Manning went through the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his Quantico military prison, where he had settled in reinforced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine surveyed him to the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints about misconduct, although the officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials had discussed them with him and said they would deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote (after meeting the concerns) “No problems,” and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee that should investigate the suicide ideas mentioned by him a few months earlier in a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status as a "prevention of injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one step under the threat of suicide - to him and to protect others.
“I wanted to convince employees that it went well to me and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and displaced to Kuwait, where he was arrested for nearly two months before he was moved to the Quantico Marine Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once became unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world has been burdensome.
"My world struck on Camp Arafjon, on this cake together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cake.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell – at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours – and without society.
You only have allowed him a mattress, a ceiling, flip-flops, clothes, and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because it was forbidden to sleep or just sleep on the day.
He has always had to sleep with light, which ends in his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and couldn’t see his guard’s face, he was awakened so that he would turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings’ lawyer formally opposed the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his roof during this counting.
At the question on Friday, Manning stated that from a command of his guard, he had to let the ceiling with which he could cover himself fall, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he was forced to sleep naked last night, he had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the bond of his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself, but did not do that.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention sentences and reduce his detention measure drastically, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is imposed for the beginning of the next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will be confessed to minor offences, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme are to be charged.
The continuation of the hearing is required for this weekend, and a justification of the conditions of detention is expected from the prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners held in Quantico among the highest security measures.
The accusations against Manning include the favor of the enemy, illicit publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he is threatened by a life-long imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of chances
Mexicans tend to accuse the migrants - they call them into memory hard times, he says.
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are captured between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control, when i was widespread idleness.
Pictures refer to two waiting snakes: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "External" ("External").
I was there for a few seconds, unsure about which I should move.
I have grown up in Central California and have been called Mexicans all my lifetime.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iran" or my friends in New York City "Italian".
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But that was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or binding strings.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent will not be released either.
So I took my American passport and put myself into the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, and it is a reason for Mexicans to stay in Mexico today with equally high probability instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to connect with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block as an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the Mexican war against the drug cards, even though he did not mention any details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never missed a single thought that the United States entered Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under a presumed weapon to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how Americans deceive the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas move on the way to war.
However, Mexico’s biggest challenge is in reality in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winner and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason that so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our tribe, a person - perhaps a parent or grandfather - did not have a chance in Mexico and moved northward.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and have received good jobs, we should never lose sight that it is the American dream we live – not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be overwhelmed, but as regards our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership layer do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a deceitful defeat and look down on us because we are not enough Mexicans.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
You think our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the sea wall - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans hurt them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she is seen as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are not part of any other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resum their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We want to tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their bonds with Mexico.
No, no.
That won't happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair income distribution, the unfair corruption and drug law, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are still not willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a half a century ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans are upset about how their family members have not been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "Mexicans" as I thought.
Old Fight, New Middle East
Weapon stop between Israel and Hamas could prove itself an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bleeding events seem to stir up such a hope in the keim.
In the middle of the usual fault deportation, countless buildings were put in shields and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of which civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were captured near the Israeli metropolitan Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be captured in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring has created a new uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these wires.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
However, there are reasons to assume that the deadly path situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism seems to be different from the current situation.
Even if the arms stop, agreed on 21 November, this week's fights have strengthened the hard shots on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claimed to have retreated Israelis, although its grouping itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been infiltrated in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas so far.
In fact, Hamas is winning in the West Bank, controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders may conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a renaissance, regional power, once considered Israel’s closest Muslim allies, has captured the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilee Hamas followers believe that there is an Islamic half moon around Israel - from Lebanon in northern, where the militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could stand before the fall of Bashar Assad, until Jordan, where Hamas’ allies threaten the king.
And particularly the rise of Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most powerful and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has sustained the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laïstic despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his collapse in 2011, had only little time for Hamas.
On the contrary, fraternity with Hamas is disregarded and its leaders are more dependent on people’s views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove itself to be an actor that cannot be expelled from Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make an opposed conclusion.
In military view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
Israeli missile resistance system, Iron Dome, has been proven and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds its position intact, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, particularly with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process too much.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have killed missiles from the Gaza Strip since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockages that have entered the West Jordan and thus the main part of a possible Palestinian state.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman with a more fighting group in advance of the January 22 elections.
Why are these behind-listed Palestinians also shaking up and leaving their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Jordan, wouldn’t they fire missiles just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in chess and punish them, they should drive to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to move, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who now sit in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence state is larger than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to establish their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi and Barack Obama are united in order to achieve a weapon stop could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to be removed from their self-determination right - a powder constitution that will certainly one day explode in Israeli occupied areas, just like a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression already undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only aggravate.
Blood missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly demanding their diplomatic tribe over the years.
Both sides need a push from outside
The correct answer is those represented by the most reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and by the newspaper: two states where Israel leaves for security purposes.
The hope for the near future is that the weapon suspension gives outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop the arms supplies in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish State based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by a region and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than for the next UN observer status application.
Obama must also help his part to move Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he refused to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-term perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packaging will enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages that are equal to all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws on single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia, which replaces brand logos and colors with neutral, olive green coverage, which are printed with drastic images, which are sick parts of the body and show babies and children sick with cigarette smoke.
Apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packaging in the brand names that are printed in identical, small letters is from Saturday.
Australia introduces the strictest arrangements for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government conducts studies that have shown that people who haven’t started smoking with 26 years of age will no longer start with 99% of probability.
“You can already see in young children that they understand the message they are trying to apply to tobacco companies with their brand image,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking quotas in the world and changes will only have a slight impact on multinational companies’ profits, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco club struggled hard against the laws.
The laws would favor black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre by British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeitors will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that laws have promoted their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette nets and silicone coverage has increased enormously to cover the intolerant packaging since the British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan two months ago, the top of the Australian court's law.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units in wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hacks are in the popularity of social media in the exact population group to which the plan addresses.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, ban them to appear as sports sponsors and most traders have forced to no longer interpret cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area to apply for its products does not come around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in experience reports on brands written by “a lot of normal people”.
You need to ask yourself: Is that just a private person who finds such great favourite of Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focused on dealing with new laws instead of marketing.
She has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries operates greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted negotiations with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to preclude photographic warnings in 2001.
Currently, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are sad.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a kid and pull out the box,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumour.
Honestly, there’s only one reason I’d stop, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city center of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shirts.
“I took an hour before to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have just completely prohibited cigarettes - then we would have said all right, it was, we made close," he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be stubborn too.
I spent this Thanksgiving five hours in an unexpected way at the airport, when our plane broke out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts too sad.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight half a day at the airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and children’s development experts are leading long-term than a little positive.
If it goes after them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be tired sometimes.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And since most of us today almost constantly stir on one or another screen, the benefits of the long-term are no longer beneficial.
So, should we welcome the braves with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no, no.
I'll come back again.
Like many people, I have always thought that Langeweile is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not look like that.
"In fact, the long-term has a very long history," he says.
The home walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graphite over longweils that returns to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we actually define longevity.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that longevity has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that longevity as an experience to want to "exercise a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to" define it.
In the meantime, it differs from apathy, according to the fact that the person is not busy, but that is what he wants to be.
In the case of apathy, there is no fear to do anything.
The key experience of the long-term, he says, is in a "disturbance of the attention process, accompanied by bad noise and the feeling that time is only slowly passing".
You can hear it almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be related, distressed people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even though we have only difficulties to concentrate.
In her study "The Unengged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of long-terms under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment, a person in front of a magazine, a participant listening to a band article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighbouring room that had nothing to do with the content; others heard it on low volumes, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not understand these noises at all.
The people who barely understood the hearing television said to feel more long-sufficiency than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, couldn't find any reason for it, and wrote their difficulties of long-sufficiency.
When you try to focus on a difficult or hard work, the disturbance of attention can lead to longevity, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the contrary, if you exercise a single-tone activity - "as the search for defective products on a factory support belt, you can denial music and help not feel ashamed."
In fact, as he says, we now know that potatoes and crystals, often interpreted as signs of long-terms, can even fight them by keeping people more physically aware.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down,” Professor Fenske said.
We’ll all be boring - my delayed flight, a sharp speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale of long-wide vulnerability".
On the scale there are statements like "Too many things I have to do repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly as regards the need for more and more external trips.
But in general, teenagers are a rather relaxed crowd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted a experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with a Pager.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and at the completion of home tasks were deprived of being deprived of being deprived if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt annoyed.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know whether the percentages in terms of longevity have risen or declined.
However, he is sure that “young will feel particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers have no great influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is Langeweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to relieve them - that have been shown in studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between longevity and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has explored the subject for more than two decades.
“With the long-suffering, the brain wants to say something else should be done,” said Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do the best.
If you are boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
However, although television can provide a short-term happiness, these flourish in the long-term again.
Anyone who has an iPad enough for his child can take it away from the pain, but it hasn’t learned to entertain or control himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control transfers from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to have fun, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we're going to have to pay attention.
We should not see them too critically either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well, too, apart from the ongoing activity and technological development.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should often be boring, but sadly, it is a boring, constant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are actually only looking for a way to unlock and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to occupy when the noise is broken.”
There are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a trial in Southeast Colorados, which will soon be legal in this state: possessing a few fewer marijuana brokes and a peep with which he smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling with the car in Lamar on a September day near the border with Kansas when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was asked for the possession of drugs and drugs—cavaliers who each had a punishment of $100—and received a court date.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the unconscious weeks after the State’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drugs depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities around marijuana are already left here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer pursuing adults over 21 years of age for ownership, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
Attorneys in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that they continue to pursue existing marijuana and still cite people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from Denvers to Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licented marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is developing so fast that I don’t know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington also crawl down on their heads.
They are waiting for an orientation aid for the establishment of a license system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline before 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is, in any case, the majority of states in advance of the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consuming.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Spiritual Beverage Authority in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serving in the sense of a cruel guide.
“We have no real precedent that we can follow,” he added.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, and thus forms the end point of a green zone where the State License System is not yet existed, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the government's provision of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis stores within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
“There will be nowhere harder to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s baking area,” says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an email in which he stated that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana deaths in people over 21 years, and that police would not "instantly" seek criminal announcements for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban regulations to regulate farmers of medical marijuana and that drug dealers will continue to be pursued.
In Weld County in northern Colorados, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to be liable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue violations at the time of deeds," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are duplicate even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters refused the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the countryside, no longer show adults to own smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership procedures.
“I don’t think I waste my time by implementing the right until it changes,” he said.
Although 55% of Colorado’s voters supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged local officials a profound twist in terms of the great green experiment day by day.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents accused of marijuana offenders and acts on-site as a spokesperson for the national organization for the reform of marijuana occupation.
"They have spent so much of their lives pursuing people criminally that they can't accept legalization," he said.
As the first countries to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national pattern cases for legalization of drugs.
While spokespersons and state officials are preparing for a legal sales age, they are at the same time also nervous waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat sales and growing marijuana at federal level as a crime.
Speakers of the Legalization Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be dismissed.
Despite several reputable arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in large part in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former narcotics adviser of the Obama government, believes that although criminal officials are likely not going to enter doors to capture smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to swallow those under the new legislation to legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses.
Several cities in Colorado do not expect the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratorium for new marijuana businesses, although they could open only in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided to adopt a six-month ban, which is likely to be adopted next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We judge ourselves according to what the church has chosen for and not according to what the state has chosen for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university I once thought to be the world’s largest knowledge stamp for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the large pillars of civilization – free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after I entered the Worscester College in the late 1980s - there I had to study history - I had repacked my bags and thus brought the first scandal in my life.
My father broke in tears together.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard it was called, I would have gone because I had a problem with comics having sex in the neighbouring room.
The author A N Wilson said shelmically that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I'm running away.
Yeah, I did, because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not just because of my pretty unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was only sent out for one reason - a reason that seemed in this alleged weight of lighting for so narrower and cruel: my now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I was the supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I talking about this right now?
Now, according to current reports, a new generation of students suffer from moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hate for Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demands equal protection, benefiting gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College state that they are often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted due to their political views.
They require a place in the Equality Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentric and neonazis.
This was shown, among other things, by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association at Oxford University, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce, with silver-colored dress and silver-occupied jewelry.
To other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "sacrifice for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association at Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing linkage to universities.
People believe we are like the Bullingdon Club without having met us at all.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unacceptable." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, the president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, said she has observed a growing rejection of JCR members with students of moderate rights.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discussion and to the welfare of the members,” she said.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shameful 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred to the Conservative Party had reached its high point.
Last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher – a former student – not to grant honor due to cuts in high school.
The atmosphere would even make Stalinists scare.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students met and the tutors, I received a pre-taste on the future events.
I experienced that the tutors did not only tolerate the displacement of Tory students, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the mining workers’ strike, privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa have found their way into the top-top areas of the Tutorial.
At my first events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century to English, and I hadn't been picked up on what would happen.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (even dead), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stole it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from cake, and quite harsh.
“Do Thatcher followers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students looked at.
In my eyes, tears turned up.
"I suggest you take a few hours of French in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt told me.
I went back to my room with a hanging head.
That evening I was sitting alone at college at dinner when someone lightly hit me on my shoulder.
He was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's how it's.
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory will be disturbed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher's closer, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory semesters suggest to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried to imagine later.
I insisted that I didn't agree with Mrs. Thatcher at all points.
This trick should prove itself unsuccessful.
A student in Philosophy, Politics and Economy, who ironically visited the conservative Eton College, said to me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was pervers and fucking.
“How did Tories have sex?” one asked.
They fight each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals had to feel before the U.S. more liberal legislation.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same feeling only after the collapse of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were before me, spread to my spiritual eye to a fire fire of sealing and insulation.
The only tutor to recognize himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smallly, and rejected him for his Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he took a profession at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I began to climb between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unfaithful.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends have always put perfect ways on the day.
His moisturizing eyes were sad.
Give him a chance.
I'm sure you're just naked.
It would break my heart if you went.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my boyfriends, also Tory's followers, had left the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a tutorial next week, in which another historian seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly broken from shame, I admitted that my parents had been subjected to a "brain wash" and called her "old trottel".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes my hats opened up.
When they went, I picked up a bag and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'm glad you can call me a bitch of sleep.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such anxiety and evil in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hid itself behind an unmanaged reputation of equality and freedom of thought until today.
"Valentino attracts elegance of celebrity"
At the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that deserves the residence of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 skin couture dresses were composed, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story, whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his distinctive clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and remote world of the award.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the readiest aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, to Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashionist in Voghera city in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
Being in love with the adel does not have to be of disadvantage.
“At least they don’t show up their chickens on your magnificent cover, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We are all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the fashion maker’s charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he felt and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "Top-Modell", which began their race at the week of the Haute Couture in 1995 in Paris.
“He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she concludes.
Moden View of Origin
Garavani’s life is not a story of abuse, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 metres long runway that suggests a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire Farain's dreamy "audience" or is part of where the Valentino's Nottingham is dressed with the masterpieces, such as Ari's Moh's dress, Jackie's Kennedy's
In this audience of fashion puppies, there are names such as Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I still remember perfectly.
It was a shirt, a shirt, a western type "Gillette" and a shirt from the Autumn/Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designers' mouse.
“I take him to all others because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty,” the ex-Duchess of Feria added.
I like the colors he uses very; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also, the princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget for the first time she wears a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of having finally the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to it.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a celebration in the castle of my veteran, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper part with a decoration that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream," said Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino doesn't depend on fashion, his occupation is timeless," explains the Italian aristocratic who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashionmaker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress but also the associated memories."
The "King" of Fashion
The great final of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his closest girlfriends) were necessary to make this elfenbein-colored seed dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half-meter long shaft.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the skin Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honor legion, accumulates as many honors as every husband of his clients.
"I am always his refinement, his quietness, his careful and perfect outer notice," adds D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good girlfriend of me.
“He was unmarried; the time leaves no trace of him.”
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian Volcano put their lives and health on the game when they wear 70 pounds of sulphur over the steep, stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by taking sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to go down to the ground of his crater every day, where the silent gas that comes out of the earth climbs in contact with the air.
After he broke out large sulfur stones that can weigh up to 70 pounds in total, he transports them into two bamboo fabrics on his shoulders over the abstract paths of stone.
Although there are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to rise at the scalp rate, while they have to keep the balance and put their steps carefully so that they don’t escape and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, like this happened to a French tourist who fell down on the slopes of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen’s miners earn 5 Eurocents for each kilo of soap that they cut off.
When they arrived above, they crossed the road between the tourists who photographed them like circus saffrons and run with the tiredly heavy baskets three kilometers to the weight, which a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (not better known) its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupee (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupee (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to produce strip wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
“Because we normally wear 70 kg, we get around 46,000 Rupee (3.8 Euro) for every way,” Anto explains to us, who usually runs three routes a day.
For each route, he takes three hours after which he has fully managed, but at the end of the day he then has Rs 138,000 (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhuman effort is the triple of what he would earn with field work.
"The day wage of miners here, where the coffee harvested is paid for Rs 15,000 (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly income is Rs 2 million (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 Rupee (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that is for a reason that is as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindues, and I brought them to Islam to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, humbles frequently and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has put his life on the game for three years at Kawah Ijen, whose soup has already left his first tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, dizziness frequently, and his eyes are irritated due to the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for his dream.
“I’ll work here for two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This friendly and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, Kellner or at the receipt of a hotel, but instead performs the work of a cartoon.
He shares a dirty wooden cabin with other bearers and stands up every morning at 2 p.m. because the soup is also excited at night, where its characteristic yellow color is bright in the dark.
The shadows are challenging, he climbs in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet that he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the basket with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great gains, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
You will also receive no share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) extra per camera required by the guards of this natural park along with the input money of 15,000 Rupees (1.2 Euro) from tourists coming to photograph the volcano and the human cell.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old wearer who has been working for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes" because he needs the money to educate his three children aged between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the soup burns the throat and jukes the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the miners climb into the thick columns rising out of the crater, men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees, bladders on the shoulders.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at the age of 53, is only able to wear 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks through a cow path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in a distance of 18 kilometers.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik explains, opening his mouth widely, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, at the age of 30, also works as a sweater carrier.
The time passes, but poverty holds generation to generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human load on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame for having no children, on career, stress, and the cost of real estate and child education.
“The population of Singapore has to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: fulfill our citizens' duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a Minzbonbons advertising, but - or just because of it - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rapper song, which includes local proverbs such as "Skips will make a "bao" (laib) in the ovens to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertisement company BBH, which turned the video, observes the hope that the advertisement spot reaches funny way to make the problem noticeable.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton said he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national duty."
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When we are planting, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a matter that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating finishes (speed flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, “Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to cope with this problem, such as compiling a rap?”
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Each year, she spends $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have children anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "bigest career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities except to marry and form a family," she explains.
These changes in social situations have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the delays of marriage and births, resulting in the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counter the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the scarcely scattered xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping their wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also considered one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the declining birth rate has the known impacts on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are being built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoch boxes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the lonely, and that they are scared of building building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of Real Estate Company EL Developers, says that its "shock boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are outsellered for days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide developers with clearer orientations to which obstacles have been put in the way before if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to an increase in national birth rate, the conversations with the Singaporeans working in the financial district is to realize that they will not have a great impact.
“People are strongly stressed, apartments and education are expensive, so it is driven out by many,” said a young manager.
The children can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old man.
Men and women conduct their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and education as a reason for not having children.
That’s why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting children – the government can do so much.
Offline Private Offline is private online
Privacy Policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "the same area of private life, where you have the right to protect against any kind of intervention."
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply to its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently traveling online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I would not announce in a post," said 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the significance of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“That’s very confidential secrets, my mother must know them, but not the whole world,” he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also share my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not from me or someone who makes the stupid head,” he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to write beautiful photos, from naked, from crimes, or offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures him to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if someone responds to me, I’m just uploading it,” he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can quickly talk to relatives or friends in the distance,” he says.
Asked, he answered that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommends a stranger to him, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, for example, music,” he said.
After the boy's indication, no one made any statements to him or asked him for his address or telephone number.
“When someone hurts me or asks me for it, I just remove it from my user account,” he admits.
José signed up with Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy's experiences are not known as cyberbullying today.
A girlfriend’s acquaintance was trapped in a social network.
They threatened him and asked for money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or sad situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathy to me or I want to wipe him out one.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher in English with a college degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a means of searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the workshop "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are the children and teenagers who have grown with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants to teach, where we still learn,” he said.
He explains that this is a complex topic, “because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion about what is spread, published or said, and this at an age where matureness is not sufficient for it.”
"They should also be selective when it's most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
“Tell them not to do it, it doesn’t work,” he said.
Porras then calls a few options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the internet?
Or would you like to post a photo of you, like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what others are saying about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before labeling photos of celebrations?
And another question: Do everyone know what you’re doing at any time?
Another point is to give them understanding that they have to act online as they do it offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Studo Guardia, professor of university, primary school teacher and educator, comments that it is necessary for parents to read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When you understand all sections, you have solid foundations to talk to your children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children must be reminded of the lesson "Do not speak with strangers".
End of the UNAUR Summit without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven present governments.
Efe attempted repeatedly to obtain access to the signed document at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources at the National and Presidency Office initially reported that they would be transferred to it after the clause, but afterwards declared that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website for some time.
When asked questions about the text, they stated that the content was submitted to the press by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists were received by the press speakers of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was published during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which encouraged hundreds of journalists of various national and international media uncomfortable demanding more information.
The President of Peru then sent the media an e-mail with the “concluding statement” of the summit, but it was the statement of Humala and not the official document for the completion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the third summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and also at this opportunity, despite a press press call, Lima’s so-called statement previously announced was just as little published.
On the official website of ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published on Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that information systems would be available for journalists, but they restricted high level access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru, to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague that joins a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the Court initiating Monday in the Hague in the process of launching Lima against Santiago to listen to both sides.
"We will follow, follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are making to this international court right now," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is and remains a country that follows international laws, seeks peaceful dispute resolutions, concludes agreements and undertakes international courts,” said Piñera, greeting Humala with a hand pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subjected to the Court of Justice took place after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of the International Court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo was dismissed, has not participated in the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the conversations in the morning and ended the summit shortly after the lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state laid down the final document, which reported that 16 decisions were made and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
Among the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries will "take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which will extend us to the decisions on residence rights."
He stated that measures would be promoted to improve cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in cities and against organized cross-country crimes, as well as to improve access to drugs and Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and effectively in the event of natural disasters.
With the crisis in Europe, “the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not adopt triumphable trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our people a better future,” Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," the President of Peru said in a statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvians located on the cross-border axis of their territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American nations," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbouring relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before he began his participation in the regional meeting, said that he was expecting a meeting with his opponent to Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the IGH in question by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the deal with Nicaragua is also necessary for negotiations with Nicaragua," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
“South America has to learn about citizens’ integration,” says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans were "killing in the Second World War and in other disputes" and "today are practically a home country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American nationality that promotes the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as this is already happening in the spirit community, but there are still more reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the redesignation of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the pretext of reducing the influence of Angelaxis States and taking into account those signed by San José's Human Rights Agreement.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is uncomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said as an allegation to the political asylum that Ecuador gave to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but that he had followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that "there was a reasonable assumption that Assange was delivered to a third country and would not comply with its procedure."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice he requested that he be subjected to an interrogation on his territory for alleged sexual offence, while “the Swedish law permits this through a video conference that could have been conducted via Ecuador’s Embassy in London.”
Correa explained that there was a risk of affecting Assange’s health and mental condition.
“Since he was in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious problem,” said Ecuador’s head of state.
However, there is a risk that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is caught in a narrow space and can not perform physical exercises outside.
“This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution for asylum granted to Assange since June in the Embassy of Ecuador in London was to grant a freelancer that could travel to Ecuador, and that this is located in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We do not act on human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a series of procedures to various European instances," he said.
And "if the UK gives this letter tomorrow, I think it is done."
And if Sweden heard Mr. Assange at Ecuador’s embassy in London or via Skype as permitted by the Swedish law and in other cases, the problem should be done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm itself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediation, the evil intention, and the lies that strengthen the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the poor journalists who seek and oppress wins," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador would no longer be “not dominated by such journalists, nor by the bankers, nor by the hegemonic and spice-citizen countries,” and said that he would “deep the revolution in a re-election to continue the way in that right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "has to remain hardened and should not take place an opportunism and no legally dressed state-run strife" because it "has destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the legal boundaries between the two countries, for "absolute legitimate."
Currently, this judgment is not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated extensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also trusted a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile in front of the same Court of Justice and said that "it is right for Latin America to call international instances when both countries are committed to accepting the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility of being candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to reach its third mandate in consecutive, he stated that he "see this possibility with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it also falls very hard."
Correa assured that if he abandoned the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never been interested in me personally, but under such unfair circumstances as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to follow this responsibility," he said.
If I had to win it would be my last period as president, then I'll get out of public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"That's decided," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for planned routine treatment, and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not mean in any case a relapse in the health condition of President Chávez,” he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated in Lima today at the 6th Summit of the Union’s Heads of State and Government of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of AIDS death is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the results were confirmed: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "develop without recognizable success."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and started informing him about it with such an effort that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is certainly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he entered after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 90s as there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmatas.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided to say goodbye, "because it led to a sackgase."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and whose virus has already damaged and excreted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success of today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, according to reports published in April.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectious disease and HIV/AIDS specialist, commented that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the beginning of the treatment, from 200 CDs4 at the beginning of the treatment4.
Simply speaking, the above claims mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 in this sense "can be 75 years old as long as he is under control."
In order to correctly order this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011), it is right that 60 percent of the patients have died since the emergence of AIDS in the national database.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and by May of this year there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why do people still die there?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no care problems with drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced condition because they don't know their infectious condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection. In order to affect global mortality, early diagnosis are needed, so all people in which this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests.”
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Council Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also patients like Fabrizio, who had conducted his test at a private laboratory, and this was the only reason for Tumor had been a kind of reason, because it was a friend of him, and even a friend of the youth of AIDS.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’ll die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather put it three times," it says in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sports and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I work, I work a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I care about my health and the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid of AIDS today.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group, the sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the lodging table
There are large holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places, “the distribution of condoms actually increased; before they were issued individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the risks of new infections are young people.
"Why do you need the?" is a widespread question of social workers, orientation staff at schools, pharmacies employees, and in the health system that young people don't want to expose themselves," the correspondent said.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the shop, but also in public toilets in facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by compromise.
They should not be paid the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity,” he pointed out.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (1,258 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally located in the fourth place of new and cumulative cases of AIDS, and in the 13th place of HIV.
92% of infections occur through sex, 6% through blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case that they don’t know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s obligations achieved through a trade competition in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent will be created for each national company with neighbouring settlements, which has payment problems.
Therefore, it could be said that the procedures for survival of companies that allow Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of Stars and Stripes, unlike international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment made on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas causes the Mexican companies to be subjected to the detention of their property beyond the Bravo River without help.
However, the decision opens to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico door and door to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge pointed out that creditors must be subject to the U.S. competition law, the appeal court of the Fifth Circuit headquartered in New Orleans says the main proceedings are the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency procedures is unknown for companies with cross-country profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Act was created to harmonize international trade law, and the American Law Institute was established as a clearer.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the voices of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the concurrent mass that the branches of Vitro with their mother company would not have achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities under the group were confirmed by the Federal Institute for Trade Competitions (Institut Federal de Concursos Mercantiles).
It is also true that, after the votes of the branches were withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors complaining against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have decreased by 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for its difficult situation since 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States that hit the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada is opposed to the same appeal court, so that the vote will take place in the plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not made, the Cerciorare appeal, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious matter in this case is that the Court has left a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Trade Competitions, and which indicates that the United States had strictly negotiated the 15th of the Contracts signed by the two countries.
It should also be noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a hit for Vitro and the country.
General Balance
After the announcements by the Mexican air traffic trade unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of a fraudulent administration, have not advanced for several months, the Association Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The investigation by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is accused of disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the Republic’s Chief Administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the bank IXE account F/589, on the name of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million Pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares by Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded by
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental defenders, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplementing a living area for 150 companies employees.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental institution that has destroyed partially protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has not fulfilled a Senate request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation of ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken away the possibility because he considered them a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the building company Homex puts on the market more than 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four of the same emissions that promises a payment of interest every 28 days.
Founded by Competival
Founded by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a company group was founded under the name Competival, the aim of the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world basketball bomber, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled around the world.
A few in Puerto Rico have such a large spiritual collection of the history of the country’s basketball like Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was part of the sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, the first national league players, representatives and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or the Basketball Association president.
"For my life, I have set up many basketball guards, even several at the same time as I was president of the BSN, head of business of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with his loyal wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamon in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that reminded him of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-business manager or manager of the club.
“It was my best years I enjoyed most because I had been part of eight of the Vaqueros championships since 1967 as manager, co-business manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I welcomed myself with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I still remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and hired at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have a very powerful and 2 meters large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freelancer Raymond Gausse, who left himself citizens and was one of our best rappers.
I still remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
He was awarded the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he proposed to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember when we won the first time at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Afterwards, the 1990 World Cup, where we invested the fourth place, which should actually be bronze, hadn't been that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of 1990 World Championships the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and the U.S. team made a fight like when they won against us at the World Championship bronze.
In that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were attended again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be attended for a knee injury in 1990.
A team that might not be the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and gave us great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic tournament in New Queen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players due to the events of the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we win the gold medal against any prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculin.
And this without taking into account his race in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill’s work.
What do you think is the best you've achieved in the band?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 90s to 17 teams in one season.
What's left to do for you?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce play only in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the kids do not need a lot of travel and games.
At least I see the result of prescribed training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I love listening to music, watching videos from music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren from time to time I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became world-wide famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrupulous, domestic, and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of the 80's.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
“Larry was back to his beloved hometown Dallas, where he played the iconic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequence series, was at Hagman when he died in the hospital in Dallas, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted he had drunk a lot over years.
In 1995, a malign tumor was found in his liver, and he had been transplanted.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice guy on television in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" at the NBC TVanstalt.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is placed on his head when he meets an attractive "dshin" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also actor of two comedians, which were broadcast only for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the stunning disappointing J.R., which made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot on J.R.?", which should create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were wrapped in gambling houses.
The series achieved a record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators, transforming the "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of the "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the wizard of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had twisted her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unsubstituted man with a charismatic smile: a desperate businessman and an unfaithful husband who sought to show his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what to stand on J.R.’s tombstone,” said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he did not win.
Victoria Principal, a co-star of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "big personality on and outside of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unchangeable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts, who have the luck to know him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new release of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT about how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a young man when she got Larry with lawyer Ben Hagman during her marriage.
He tried his luck on the theater scenes in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the airstrikes in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I haven’t written anything that I thought it could harm anyone or harm him in any way,” the Associated Press said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he joined liver donors and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them the courage, I meet with them when their operations occur and afterwards," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's going to go well."
He also took part in smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "Ending of the World"
Every week, students examine apokalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keime and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hack: the end of the Maya calendar’s “long back counting” on December 21, of which many believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the next two months: the devastating hurricane Sandy, which some called Deudarmageddon, as well as a growing conflict with Israel, the place where the Christian theory believes that the apocalypse begins.
“I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever existed,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today as if we were away from it for thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apokalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer this semester, which should actually be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apokalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and keime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apokalyptic content and studied how they could compare them to real life.
“I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible,” Becker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a seated professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the clear name "The End of the World".
“We don’t take up 2012 so that we’ll always keep the option to keep the course back in case the world doesn’t pass,” Restall said.
Despite the "previous course" students need to study, create projects and participate in graduate exams.
In Penn State, the final examination will be conducted on the evening of the apocalypse, so students have no other chances to continue to work "until the night where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no places anymore," Restall said about his course for students with a high average that filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the semester start we received emails from students who asked whether places are still free.
Students, however, make sure that the course is one of the most interested ones.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers team for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is in fact only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nurse explains to have seen all the apokalyptic films.
“I haven’t heard anything about a lesson where it is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students - and less a professor - said to believe on the last date of December 21.
“Our first project addressed Mayas’ prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a student at Temple, 21 years old, and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is a apocalyptic fear that brings back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Otherwise, people don’t think so,” he said.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University, who teaches the Philippines this year, answers quickly the question of whether he would know there a course on the “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as an exception to a higher instance.
We have a blessing from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that the last court had spoken over many days over the years, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophed that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world comes.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Some say they want to go to celebrations about the end of the world.
“I may call a couple of friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
