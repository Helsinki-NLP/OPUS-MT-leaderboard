Peter Chech: Transition to the last minute?
It's all possible
Today is the last day you can still jump through a transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance will come only in winter.
Petr Čech, currently replaced by Chelsea, is now not over the new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco and Paris.
She is sitting in the NH Hotel, talking to Czech journalists and is preparing to play with the American general and then to start the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In the Chelsea branch, Thibaut Courtois, the Czech Republic, in the new Premier League season, has become a substitute in the London club for the first time in ten years.
A long time ago, it was speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
At the beginning of the season, he lost the Spanish Super Cup in the fight against the Athletics and could not even enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
He also speculated about the interest of Paris SG.
In the season of the French League, he scored two wins and two remits, with St. Etienne 5:0 shooting on Sunday.
relatively most pressing the boot club AS Monaco.
He still has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league, and Lille was quietly divided by 1:1 on weekends.
On the Bulgarian English websites today, news reports that the Czechs might want to be at Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, the Czech Republic’s leaving Chelsea in the last minute is not too likely.
Skybet wrote a course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change the dress in the remaining few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a 100% in football.
Maybe there will be an offer that will not be rejected during the day.
How would this offer look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know how an offer that can't be rejected looks in fact.
The agreement of all parties should take place. First of all, it would matter whether the club would deal with any offer or not.
Is it technically possible to make such a transgression when you are now in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary to sign a new contract in a new office?
So I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are many players today, all of them are somewhere at the representation matches and surely a lot of transgressions will be closed today.
So it would be somehow realizable.
How many clubs are on the planet that can allow you?
Well, I don't really know.
So you don't try to leave?
The situation in which I did not take a new season in the first three matches is new for me after fifteen years of career.
However, there is no reason to panic, beat and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in the struggle for the position of Chelsea’s gateway and to be at the coach who chooses what decisions he will make over the next few weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision-making?
I take into account all the factors.
Of course, it is important for me to have a sporty perspective, but I look at it from a personal site to which family needs of course belong.
Would you like to take a different club in England?
That's the question I thought I'd never have to talk about.
But in football, everything is possible.
I don't want to exclude anything.
I don't know the answer.

George Webster is accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will be brought before the court for accusation of rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was convicted of the accusation during a hearing at the High Court of Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire County, claimed to have raped a woman.
According to Webster, she was attacked while “she wasn’t conscious, she was sleeping, and she was unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster has been prosecuted for raping other women at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of transfer to the Supreme Court of Edinburgh on 17 November.
Restoration of the very U.S. ideal that labour rights are human rights at the same time
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the organization in trade unions as civil rights.
“Depending on how trade unions work, workplaces are working for the middle class,” said Ellison, a Democratic Senator at Minnesota, who is the co-chairman of the Congress Committee.
Therefore, I am so proud that I can, along with the pattern of occasional rights by John Lewis, present a law strengthening the position of employees.
This intermediate legislation gives workers the same legal possibilities as to prevent discrimination in trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and will stop anti-committee forces
The Law on Labour Relations in order to allow all employees who are facing discrimination if they want to participate in trade unions, judge civil courts - and judge compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
This is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not in accordance with American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other lawmakers present is to relink to the American ideal.
Despite trade struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to welcome, expand and respect work rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country with one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and the right to gathering.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt the constitution proposed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja will be replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions played a role in the formation of new Japan, included the language and openly admitted that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to establish a constitution to ensure that Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that employees will need to organize and promote themselves in a new nation, and therefore included the clause that openly states: “The right to establish associations that will ensure and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
The agreements that will restrict or strive to harm it will be revoked and measures that lead to such a purpose are illegal.
When the former lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission for Human Rights, which proposed the General Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the applicants and Roosevelt included in it the guarantee that "everybody has the right to access them in their interests."
The entire generation of Americans accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When the countries consulted other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to create trade unions - and their participation in collective negotiations with companies and government agencies in the position of an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are attacked in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that workers must have the right to organize and promote in free and open society.
As the reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the trade unions have not reduced the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They have raised the standard of life of millions of people, created a market for industry and production, and raised to a unfamiliar level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we shouldn’t.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the enlargement of the protection of civil rights in order to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions is significantly delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis rebuild ideals that raised America and made it a real vow to democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
The federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the Louisiana law, which, according to lawyers, would likely close all five clinics conducting abortion in the state.
A regulation signed by Louisian Governor Bobby Jindala in June, which is to enter into force on September 1, would require after abortion doctors to have the right to accept a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s decision means that doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, need to grant this permission.
“The proposed party will be able to legally operate its activities and, in the meantime, gets permission,” said John deGravellese’s Federal Judge’s resolution.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month to allow the judge to issue a more lasting resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion resolutions, which are the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
“The decision today ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a misleading law to prepare them for health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, President and Executive Director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three out of five clinics, called for the blockade of the law.
It was immediately unclear whether the decision relates to doctors from two clinics that were not among the complainants and also apply for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have adopted similar laws, while courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures anti-constitutional.
The key parts of the Texas law that would close the majority of the remaining clinics in the state would be blocked by federal judges on Friday.
Fighters for women's rights to abortion together with the Association of American parents and gynecologists and the American Medical Association argue that the need to have this authorisation puts on physicians requirements that are not medically necessary.
The opponents of abortions opposed the goal of measures to protect women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed due to the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that in Louisiana only one doctor is authorised to abortion.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop doing abortions, this doctor would also stop taking the action from fear of their safety, the group said.
In response, the Louisiana authorities said they would not send doctors carrying out abortions while waiting for the settlement of a request for rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment kills an ovarian cancer in the country more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video with their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their opponents in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1,100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% five years after vein diagnosis.
Susan Jordan, head of research from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20% more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New medicines can slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers monitored women during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said that the chances of survival were affected by the age of women during the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women with cancer diagnosed in the more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20% more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors could be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
“The disease is best able to treat gynecologists who usually live in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services that have to overcome a barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transport services that will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated far from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, emphasizing the need for better treatment and preventive programmes.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer today published by Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old young mother, Elisha Neave, from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of house owners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, a decline associated with the extraordinary loss of owners of homes under 35 years of age could lead to the fact that today’s young generation of consumers will reach “the main age group of gardeners,” garden centers will reach up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent their homes lose on average 55 per cent of the amount that people lose in their homes.
As other factors threatening the sector, which earns an estimated five billion pounds a year, it indicates an increase in the number of people living in very urbanized areas, where there are no gardens, the popularity of beaches instead of a pre-garten used as a parking area and the reduced size of the garden.
In the Greater London area, where the share of houses owned declined from 61% to 43% over the six years, one of the lowest household expenditure on garden products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Garden Society argued that housing in rent or lack of space does not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, the chief garden advisor for RHS, said: "The renters are very popular planting in flowers - when they move, they can take plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the “gold age” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of household owners and economic prosperity from the 80s to the 90s.
It also predicted a higher rate for this year thanks to a better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator tells about democracy.
After Putin's youth organization, which most reminds me of Hitlerjugend, saved with atomic weapons and found out to everyone that their opinions are stolen, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I feel that the current regime in Russia shows many characteristics of the fascist state.
Great peoples have one thing in common and it is that they are able to dominate both defeated nationalism and that the complex of minor values can transform into imperialist chastisement.
Time is obviously different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the era of war over Europe had been far away, on the contrary, in the east, it thought that they had been overlooked for a long time and had to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis enforced power, and then followed an explosion of unlike nationalism in today’s situation in Russia.
And then the entirely similar cult of a strong leader, the silence of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, is therefore quite similar to faith.
Vladimir Putin, and most of the Russians, are likely to be defeated after Russia ruled half of the world and the second part was defeated in front of them.
Perhaps western politicians have made it themselves, maybe a little Vladimir was knocking on his shoulder, maybe they didn't call him where he wanted to be, and maybe they began to underestimate him, and he was just a typical Russian man.
He made an order at home, looked like he didn't really want anywhere and broke knives at home.
Now he decided to regain lost positions.
It starts slowly, it's time.
He's probably a leader for life, so he's going to hurry.
The Kavkazans are now the Ukrainians, then there are a number of people from the Baltic.
These Russian bears have been shipping in their skin for a long time.
This will certainly be noticed by China, which in some way is going to jump too much and will certainly make a stunt for the far East.
And those Germans, Vladimir, too, are very good to see how well they are, and I gave them that at 45 so on the back.
What to do with a new Novorossia in Karlovi Varech.
That would be the base, and ours have a lot of them there, and as they print them there, they've already wanted to break the lecker out of them.
So far, our veterans are reminded of what they had done in the Czechoslovakia.
They vote because their Prime Minister Mr. Sobotka, who is so soft, can blow up like a chicken, and their entire EU can dream.
That would be the case if they jumped on the big Russians.
They need to remember where their place is.
And as an explosion, we will use our co-workers who live in their territory.
The Russians are enough everywhere, and when they say they're printed there, they're just printed there, and we're not leaving that, we're protecting them.
And again, Russia will rule, because something else is born to.
Europe is only good as a presentation to which the proud Ivan can dance.
Turkey calls for US diplomat for spying report
Turkey's foreign minister called on the highest-built U.S. diplomat in the country to explain a report on U.S. and British spying activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials had acted on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target for U.S. and British reporting services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has aggravated the importance of the report and said that all relevant states are watching each other.
The older report, which also focused on Ankara by the German reporting service, raised a more widespread response to the Turkish government.
The Game of Thrones Series introduced other tricks in the fourth series
The Creators of the Game of Thrones are currently recording the episodes of the fifth row of the cult series.
At the same time, they praised how the fourth series tricks came up.

Police Director in Magaluf accused of corruption
The complainants on Friday submitted evidence to the Mallory State Prosecutor's office that the police and state officials of the municipality in the self-governmental region of Calvia were dismissed.
The chief of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges of entrepreneurs and bar owners in an unfamiliarly celebrated party district in Magaluf.
Top Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into investigation after several entrepreneurs from Punta Ballena accused him of corruption, a street where most bars and nightclubs are located in Magalufa.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of corruption by police and state officials of the municipality in the self-governmental area of Calvia on Friday to the Mallory Prosecutor.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish State Police for allegiance with corruption charges and, along with Navarre, the judge will be interrogated.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC cited the unsatisfied owners of night firms that the benefits by public agents have a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money for a long time, but about survival,” one of the entrepreneurs said at the court.
Don't play with our lives.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the main page of magazines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube, an eighteen-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to monitor the drunkenness and exhibitors in a number of participants in the holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of unknown alcoholic tours after bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event occurred, was forced to close for a year and, along with Carnage’s tour organizers, pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is mostly popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcoholic accidents including fashion waves known as "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel’s pool.
The first spring day marked by rain and storms that had an impact on the flight at Adelaide airport
JARO brought ice surprises to South Australia, came with strong rain and strong winds that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected to fall up to nine o’clock in the city and another 6.6 mm is expected to fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced along with a few short breaks associated with the storm and wind blows, which began at 8:00 a.m. in the evening and in about 10 minutes brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation.
After a few early doses of spring came last week, the temperatures in the city fell again at just 15.8 °C on Monday.
It is believed that the storm weather has contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land at a moment after 19:30, but for a short distance it hit a change in speed or direction of the wind and was forced to delay the landing.
The wind blowing at the airport in Adelaide at the time reached the land at a speed of about 50 km/h.
The flight data indicated that the aircraft had to leave from the second landing and finally reached about 20:40.
The delay resulted in further delays including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
According to forecasts, temperatures in Adelaide may reach up to 16 °C on Tuesday and one or two surgeries may occur.
Israeli children return to school after war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb covers, while during the fifty-month war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes missiles and mines.
The beginning of the school brought to the communities in the south of Israel noticed attacks felt a sense of joy and excitement, but the signs of battle are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the school employees of the missile attacked removed the remains from the wall after the squads and waited for the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but we're looking forward to the other," said Ronit Bart, a Saad kibucco resident and a local English teacher at school.
Many children in this area really need to come back to their daily routine.
Her eleven-year-old daughter Shani Bart told her that "it's a little strange" to go back to school suddenly.
“We’ve experienced a few difficult moments and haven’t left the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the border with Gaza, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire of the war ended last week, thousands of border settlements such as Saad remained within their homes or homes and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and minibuses.
Many of the inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which she shot a four-year-old kid from the Palestinian minomet, killed with her return.
The Minister of Education said that about 12 families have not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
President Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderota, a city on the border with Gaza, which was severely affected by the Palestinian armor.
He urged the children to study carefully and added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited pace last Tuesday.
The ceasefire resulted in the immediate end of the fighting, but it did not solve key problems such as the Hamas’ requirement to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopening the airports and ports of Gaza.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers falling into the war.
The new indirect bike is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
According to estimated Palestinians and the United Nations, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel doubts and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other Gazan radicals shot 4 591 missiles in the southern part of the country during the fight against Israeli cities.
The Israeli army once again took over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza and estimated that 250,000 people were hiding in a hundred UN schools that turned into temporary grounds.
Due to tens of thousands of people still remaining in secret, and due to the ongoing struggles, school officials delayed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will open soon to complete education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old school boy in the largest city of Gaza.
I'm standing behind you.
Lafatu suffers from the temperature
The Czech Football Championship was held in Prague before the preparation match with the United States on Wednesday and the subsequent introduction of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
The thirty-three-year-old Spartan attacker, David Lafata, suffered by the temperature.
David isn't here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David probably still has some of those problems.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible,” said coach Pavel Vrba to reporters.
"If it's two or three days or it's going to be fit tomorrow, it's going to be seen according to his health condition that our doctor decides about," he added.
The other players are all right.
"Of course, someone has some boldness, but it's not like they can't train or participate in a match with the United States on Wednesday," the Czech coach said.
On Sunday evening, Vrba called as the last player of Spartan backup Lukashe Vách.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, taking into account other mid-polars as well.
I decided that Lukáš is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to decide, but I stand behind it,” Vrba to Vach.
What about Šural?
Let's see what's going on with Lato.
It is not excluded that in case of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
On the weekend, for example, the Liberian Josef Šural, who gave the hattrick, was brilliant.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown the form.
Let's see how David Lafata will be on it.
If it is not possible to be available on Wednesday, I don’t say I can’t donomine any of the players who have participated in the Czech League,” Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a presentation of training in Strahva, and on Tuesday a classic pre-training training in front of the US dule at the Summer, which will be open to fans and after which the autograph will be followed.
The race with the Americans is played on Wednesday at 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the Prime Minister’s victory under the Vrbo.
He played two matches in the previous three matches and lost once.
The qualification struggle with the Netherlands will then be held on 9 September at 20:45.
Peece goes to the Netherlands to Italy
She is happy to have more time for training, unlike previous races.
It’s an advantage when you have players eight days and you can exercise with them certain things that we might haven’t had so much time before.
Now we will only be able to focus on preparing for the Netherlands as best as possible," Vrba said.
The Dutch will be introduced in Italy on Thursday before the tournament in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by the former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have a match and we're going to break it up.
There is a new coach coming to the Netherlands, let’s see what changes will be there,” Vrba told bronze medalers from the recent World Championship.
According to highly monitored statistics, the price of apartments in the winter has increased most in the last seven years.
According to the Australian capital RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to a total increase in June, July and August by 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
An annual price rise rose to 10.9%, more than twice a year by August 2013, but profits were not equally distributed in the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said they led Sydney and Melbourne to the market.
RP Data figures show that the prices of apartments in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, while the prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Another strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price rise from five to six percent.
On the other hand, Canberra was placed, which was damaged by state-regulated expenditure reduction, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Lawless said that when the spring begins now, the number of real estate sales will increase in the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"In view of the ongoing high level of auction sales, overall high speed of sales and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will continue to increase over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never gave me a drink.
He never said, "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With his father who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in the factory, they had a colder relationship.
Henry is testing the comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry had to consult with several unpleasant memories of his childhood.
After his mother’s death, Henry passed “deep” therapy and now thinks about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, you just heard his voice: “Stop with this frame.
Leave your sister in the room.
Go! Go!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a kid, they went to the bar with him and talked about things like a glass of beer or a blow in the cricket.
I never talked to him like this.
Most of my life was a serious guy in the corner as you read newspapers.
Henry recently visited Dudley’s swearing, and although the conditions were better than his father’s time, he looked at what his life had to be for him.
Today there is a little bit more light, but it is still dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth, where flames are exploding and there is a lot of smoke and satiation.
Dad always went into the bath and only lay there, then he was hearing how slowly he began to sing for himself, because he washs himself.
When I walked around, I realized that he was doing this for years to enjoy his family, and I began to appreciate it more.
However, Henry experienced childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't say, "I love you."
When my mother was sick and died, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with that "I love you"?
Don't fuck me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It's a great mom.
French, who had been married for 25 years, is still a good friend.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight, and the symptoms of diabetes began to appear, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I began to go to a big fitness center and also had to keep a dramatic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
The unusual.
No one wants to eat the same marble.
The change in the direction of Henry's career can be reflected in his elegant, short-lived bracelet.
After he received recognition from criticism for his Othel, he went into the theatre.
Followed by the Comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's plots.
It is a different experience than sitcoms and comedy that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage, showing someone, and wrote about him in a talented New Faces competition.
His TV career began in the mid-70s: "I have long been the only black imitant/comic in television."
He learned how to walk.
In addition to having to notice the public, I also had to learn how to invent functioning tricks, to be a star and to play in television, and it was really difficult.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Given that his manager had the right to produce the Black and White Minstrel Show, a fun program in which the actors were dressed in black, Henry finally appeared in his comedy for five years.
My family was no longer dreamy for that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and ridiculous position, I worked on large scenes and learned how to work with a dave.
What was “for years and years awarded British television’s main product,” but was also “the Great Black Parodie.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedian circles and introduced characters that simultaneously ridiculed and celebrated the British Black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known among others as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
For decades, he took ads, documents, television series, and roles in films, but after broadcasting his LennyHenry.tv series to the BBC in 2008, he said, "What you're doing now, Lene, it looks like you're stuck in one place, or you're going away a little."
What's So Great About?/What's so great for...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was seriously allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't teach him well at school, and I thought it was something for white high school.
So I was afraid of it.
Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't worry if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all like Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othel's final speech for the document, and it was already there.
It made me feel that I could do it.
It's like it gave me courage.
“It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn a text, learn something about it.
So the test was hard, and I read the game for months and months before.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for a break that didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in the Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly, I was in the National Theatre, I couldn't believe it.
At one point I thought, "You changed."
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the entertainment of the audience.
“The message in my head said to me, ‘Before you fix your computer, you have to have them ten minutes now.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem is solved.
I went out of the show and said something in me, "Hm, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Somebody else can solve it for me.
"You play, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plotech in Duchess Theatre
Learn the text of the Plates was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, it delivers commitment.
The game was also well accepted, so it is like God’s sign that says, “You should do this.”
Of course, that’s what he says with a great voice.
So I stay with that.
I really like it.
I'm glad at the testroom.
Henry still remains a comedian's brain - all the time our conversation is interrupting humorous performances when he enters and goes out of the role of imitator.
I decided not to make stand-ups, because having satisfaction from a room full of aliens is a bit dangerous, I would say.
When you're still looking for something, you can get into the blind street.
Sometimes I want to live at the Apollo, but I don’t like it anymore.
I was wondering if he had ever arranged a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director that helps to give the curves of the beginning, the means and the end of the journey - I don't think I would ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think that's right.
The actress has fun.
It's fun.
You're still telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers government officials to focus on non-existent employees
Kenya started with a biometric registration of all its officials to try to remove from the government’s payment certificate of non-existent employees.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving wages.
The government believes that thousands of people receive wages even after they have left the state service.
After entering the office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit conducted this year showed that the state is coming at least one million dollars a month (700,000 pounds) on the expenses of non-existent employees and after further abuse of official power.
The government is suspected that pay continues to be deposited on bank accounts even after the death of an employee or after an employee leaves the state administration, a BBC reporter from the capital of Nairobi, Wanyama Chebusiri, said.
All state officials must be sent to the identification centres within the next two weeks where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government’s statement states.
He also says that anyone who does not apologize without sufficient excuse will be deleted from the payment certificate.
“By providing real public service employees, this measure will significantly contribute to its consolidation and will also be used to clear the payment certificate at both levels of governments, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers are arrested for “slap” against the government
Local media stated that 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey for suspicion of a “government crash”.
The police has not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, among the detained were fourteen senior officials.
Some of them were involved in the December investigation into corruption, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone listening.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time the president of the government) appointed their negotiations as part of the action of the Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children return to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine were reopened on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for the families and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the President of the Government, Arsenij Jaceňuk, brought his daughter to school.
At this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that it was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not all schools have a traditional ceremony held on September 1.
Not all of Ukraine is peace.
We have to fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the unified Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at the school in Slavyansk, visited by Jaceňuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by having children dressed up shirts, bring balloons and give flowers to teachers.
The BBC may have found a boss for hard times in Ron Fairhead.
He brings with him a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclave of the Conservative Party.
She has her own experience in front lines.
She started her career at the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world Pearsons.
She was the executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned to the role when her younger co-worker was occupied by Pearson's mother company.
It is said that her departure was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Brown, former BP Director, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: he became a government advisor.
Her husband is a former member of the municipal council.
In May, I described the job of the director as a coal with me.
Not only is the BBC a widespread entity in the center of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inside the top layer of the hierarchy of the BBC's own leadership, but also outside the public's voice in the times of uncleanness when things don't work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires a thorough reform.
However, any director would risk coming into a complex company like the Chinese dynasty, deploying it and thus preparing itself for work.
It's a hard challenge.
If it wasn’t so hard, many people would like to see the BBC’s decline – its power, its finance – and its status is revised.
With the expansion of competition and the new technology questioning old certainty, it brings immediate negotiations on concessions fees to the BBC in great danger.
For a modest amount of £145,50 per year, the British public buys a share in something that is definitely the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims its production reaches 96% of households, while each cost only 40 pounds a day.
In addition, the BBC’s population is apparently rising to 53% of its favourites compared to 31% of its favourites ten years ago.
The models of use of the BBC’s services have changed: Today, newspaper titles are displayed on my mobile phone and I can look at iPlayer on the tracks I’ve asked for.
But the BBC is still a very loving and amazing institution.
He needs a great director, I hope he's found one.
Texas Governor Perry says the offensive tweet has failed
Tweet from the official Twitter account of Texas Governor Rick Perry, published on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic State Representative who initiated Perry's criminal charges of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another was published on Perry's account, which had been distracted from the previous time.
A tweet left from my account that was not authorized.
“I disagree with the tweet and downloaded it,” he added.
Perry's assistant did not respond to the messages with questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it’s not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published a humorous, unpleasant picture of the State Representative of Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, which was sentenced in April 2013 for a drunken procedure.
When Perry refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, which brought Perry, a potential presidential candidate in 2016, this month before the Great Court in Austin.
“I’m not always running three times higher blood alcohol levels than the limit is allowed... but if so, I’m complaining Governor Perry that he calls me for responsibility.”
I am the most popular Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonia, was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and the accusation was called a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge to reject the accusation because the use of laws for the legal appeal of the longest governor in the history of Texas is anti-constitutional.
Perry stopped paying $7.5 million from the State Fund for Public Interest Disaster, headquartered in Travis County, and fighting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection caused a formal complaint from a left-oriented group of civilian activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it even celebrates.
After ending in Iove during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to the speculation that he could already end, a tweet with his own photo running near the lake, saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the home market returns to normal
One of London’s most famous developer companies warned that the residence market in Southeast England “returns” to normal level of activity.
The residence in the capital was the subject of high demand and rising prices, and expanded concerns about the loan bubble led the Bank of England in June to impose mortgage limits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the Berkeley developer company for demanding clients, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current budget year, the market has returned from the top point in 2013 to the normal level of transactions."
During the decline, the London housing market was successful because buyers from abroad were flooded into the capital.
According to the catastrophic office data, only last year, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, making an average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average sales price of private, affordable and student residence from Berkeley rose by approximately 5th last year and rose to 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, due to the empowering book, in recent months the London real estate purchasers have not been so attractive - some of them also threatened the introduction of new real estate taxes and talks about possible "seat taxes", with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections of May.
The London Real Estate Office Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter loan rules, will also slow the pace of real estate sales and price growth over the second half of the year.
The new Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgage for July, indicating that the housing market is calming.
Hamptons International, another real estate office, has dropped due to the fact that home prices have already started to fall, forecasting their London real estate prices rise to 3% in 2015.
The volume of transactions, according to the WA Ellis real estate office, decreased by a quarter each year in the most expensive neighborhoods of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
However, the demand for residence in the capital of Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking housing in a good location remained the same and thus the forward sale continued.”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost one-third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual profit before taxation increased by 40% to 380 million pounds, revenue by 18% to 1.6 billion pounds.
On Monday before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that Berkeley’s annual revenue is expected to comply with the current market expectations.
Analysts estimate that the annual profit before taxation will be £450 million.
Berkeley's shares were stopped at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon at 23,96 livres.
Hacker published naked images by Jennifer Lawrenc on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrenc will come to the Academy’s 85th anniversary.
Oscar holders Jennifer Lawrenc escaped on the internet because of a hacker who claimed that he had “list” photos of hundreds of other start-up actors.
Hunger Games stars confirmed that the photos of Lawrenc are true and hacker criticized for "public privacy violations."
Offices have already been contacted and will be slaughtered by anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrenc.
Hacker photos, which were originally published on a server for sharing pictures 4chan, allegedly gained thanks to the limit in the Internet storage system of App iCloud. The list of photos of hacked victims by BuzzFeed includes names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Ostead and MaryKa- Winstead
It’s not clear how many pictures are authentic, however the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticized Twitter acts.
“I hope that those of you who look at the pictures that my husband and I took in private home years ago are satisfied,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for the Nickolodeon TV series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos would be true. On Twitter she said: "These are my allegedly naked photos, people."
It's better to get it out of the way. *proportional vocabulary heat*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that pop star Ariana Grande spokeswoman denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
Exceptional illustration from the praised new novel of Howard Jacobson on love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, this is the best way to describe it, gradually distributed as a carton box that someone left on the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complex, sturdy, isolated, and perhaps a little humiliating.
And then he cut his hand.
He admitted it out.
He was able to screw, like a jerk, yes.
The last victim of his ability was the beginning of a loving sheet, which more than usual promised to relieve him from lonely boring life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a sharp beauty with a wild-hearted hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and unhospitalier than Port Reuben.
The elderly companion came to the south, which Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called, casually, the Paradise valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The tubes were scratched, in the bathrooms were dead carpets, the slimmers slipped to the windows, as if they thought that the place belonged to them, the garden was grown up and the wheat resembled huge grapes of herbs.
The house looked like a chaloupe from children's stories, scary and at the same time fascinating, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations to the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The narrowest selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on the seat chairs in a long grass, holding their hands, enjoying an unexpectedly hot spring afternoon, sending a public station, which necessarily supplied the country with a refreshing role of black music and quiet reports, when he looked at him behind his long-sleeved comics with a long-sleeved look on his long-sleeved knick.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played in the radio.
They were not forbidden - not really forbidden - they simply didn't play.
They helped them get up to a dozen, just as the word itself did a dozen.
People’s taste proved what they would never be able to rule and position outside the law, and as people with regard to books, choose memorials in which the poor becomes rich, cooking and loving novels, so the ballads in music are chosen.
Kavern let himself climb the day and began to play an imaginary piano and a comic voice singing the Aillini series to the big pedestrians.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fatse Waller," he said, and automatically added two fingers to his lips.
This is what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started as a game when you were young.
His father told him he was playing with his father.
When you don't have two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny anymore and it wasn't funny even now.
He just knew that it was expected from him, it was all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn never heard anyone.
Even though jazz wasn't built outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation came out of fashion.
There was a place in life for only one “time.”
When she started playing melody, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same in humor.
His unpredictableness caused people to be nervous.
And jazz was a humorous song.
Although he did not hear about Sammy Davis Junior for up to ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least Aillin didn't have to say that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember the time when her favorite singers weren’t black.
Also without laws or pressure.
A favourable society is the one in which each part of it with gratitude - with gratitude for those who were happy to save - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribian origin, with temperament and constitutions, played for swimming and athletics, so singing and running.
People from the Indian subcontinent, like the nature of electronics, have assumed responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The remaining Poles were installers, the Greeks, the remaining were mistaken.
Those of the states of the Persian Gulf and Levante, whose ancestors did not quickly leave the land while it was happening, when it was happening, they were afraid to accuse them of putting them into the fire, they were afraid that the fire would spend them the next time - they opened up the restaurant, where the lambs were selling themselves.
Each according to his talent.
Because she only listened to balades, Ailinn hardly understood how music could be produced from the right words that Kavern sang to her.
Music was the expression of love.
“They’re not right,” said Kevern.
Maybe only for people who have too big legs.
My father never hit anyone, but he liked this song.
He talked too much, but the forgotten garden provided illusions safely.
Neither a word could escape outside of the noise sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he stopped getting two fingers back to his mouth in her presence.
You thought he was weird.
"He seemed funny," he said.
She stunned her head unbelievably and covered Kevern's views.
There was nothing else in the world but the sharpness of her hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
“When you think,” she dubbed.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing to me.
She looked really distorted.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
She wasn't so walking.
Maybe a little bit of cats...
You say you hate me because I've got too thick cats?
I hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could say "I love you," but it was too early for it.
“Your thick cats just attract me,” he said.
I'm so a little embarrassed.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often made him trouble, because, like his father, he lost the magic necessary to be able to break the cruelty that he laughed in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Maybe he was intentionally cruel, Kavern.
In spite of my lovely eyes.
Ailinn Solomons screamed and got up from the sheet, shook the radio and poured out a smoke-free wine.
Wine without wine, so you couldn't drink for it.
She seemed to blow up like palm leaves in the storm in her breakdown.
"I'm really attracted to you as a fool," she said.
Until it doesn't attract me.
He was sorry both for his unpleasant words and for the fear he had in his eyes at the time when he stood up against him.
Did you think she would agree with her?
She did not talk to him about life on a cold northern peninsula, where she grew up, but did not doubt that it was the same in bases as it was here.
The same broad and ice oceans have been raised about them.
The same deceased men, then, what has happened, are even more deceased and regrettable than their forefathers, spiders and cabins, angry blooming from the hostage to the hostage, ready to pull the hand on any woman who would dare to refuse or laugh at them.
Blbec?
If you don't care, they'll give her their teeth!
First, anointing it - anointing it became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibodies of bad balads about love that radio crystal - first anointed it, then one murder to her.
According to Kevern, too much cultivation, because lubrication was an act of violence itself.
Ailinn Solomons told him to leave.
He got up from the bag as an old man.
She felt herself surprised, but the silence of her sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They almost didn't know.
She looked like she was leaving - as if she watched him from the window on the floor - a man who had achieved what he himself caused.
Adam left the garden, he thought.
Her heart was shaken because of him and all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them had killed her.
The man turned away from her, shameless, defeated, defeated, all the fighting left her – why did she seem to know this look well, even if she couldn’t enjoy a single moment until today that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, once again, looked at her legs.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and exciting 20-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statuary system of public mood monitoring, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderately heavy violent acts in areas of the country where energy was getting rid of its mildness, its delay, or its delay directly.
"It has done so much and it has to do so much more," she wrote, "in order to calm down the native aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and most of them won, especially in dark, hard-available places of the country, where even the tops of the church towers emerged over the real-life plots of human inspiration."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It may seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the puddles.
The inhabitants breathe over sentimental baladams, sing unfortunate stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that the rural areas of the old brutality hold as hard as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that they do not appear at home and at work.
“Unfortunately, you tend to be too beautiful in May,” she said.
I would suggest you read less novels.
We're Nussbaum's head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I feel like I don’t have to answer that,” said Esme Nussbaum.
You're lesbian?
We reserved our right to privacy and silence again.
Feminist?
Another quiet.
“I don’t ask for that,” Rabinowitz said, “that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have any prejudice at this workplace.
We serve unprecedented companies.
But some kind of hypersensitivity, which is fully acceptable and honorable in itself, can sometimes distort judgment as you have presented it.
Obviously, you yourselves are predetermined against the Church - things that you call “cruel” and “brutal” could also be interpreted as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still addressing what happened, when it happened, as if it were happening yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the light table, pink bleached the recommendations that Ofnow transmitted to the world in the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to balades, go to music, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but nothing is better than love.
“I fully understand your reservations,” said Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure her supervisor was over, “and I don’t claim that the morning wasn’t treated as we claim she was born.
My concern is, above all, that if we do not be warned in advance, we repeat the same error that led to what happened, the fact that it happened.
This time, however, we will not ventilate anger and inconfidence on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the ends of his fingers.
This should mean infinite patience.
“You are treating too far,” he said, “when the steps that may have taken and may not have taken your grandparents are described as mistakes.
You are too far away too in talking about ventilating your "resurface" and "unreliable" to "other."
I should not remind anyone in your place that in the understanding of the past and in the protection of the presence, we are not talking about "we" and "no".
There were no "we" and there were no "they."
We only know that it was chaotic times.
“When we are honest with each other,” Esme said, “we are no one blameless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add to - we agree on this together.
And just as there is no guilt that would be put on someone, there are no things that should be fixed, even if the correction was appropriate and possibly.
But what else is the past except to learn from it?
The past exists to forget it.
If I can add something to that...
Luther Rabinowitz scattered the ends of his fingers.
"I'll take your message into consideration," he said and let her go.
The day she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcycler who hired the pedestrian in a way that the surroundings described as “bruttal and cruel.”
Accidents are happening.
The Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho claim that no gun plans – the President of the Government remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Lesotho Kingdom refused to organize a gun to destroy the government, claiming that they acted against the police suspects of attempting to arm political fanatics.
President Thomas Thabane fled from the country and said the army had surrounded its official headquarters and held government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After declaring that he was threatened by death, the Prime Minister left his family to the neighbouring South Africa.
The spokesman of the army, Ntlele Ntoi, said that it was not a gun, but the response of the army to the threat of “political fanatics” that the police tried to weapon.
“Tomorrow in the morning, the command of the defence components of the Kingdom of Lesoth was acting after several reports of the information service received that there are several groups in the series of police planning to arme some radical, political fanatics who were planning to do a start in the country,” he said.
South African government spokeswoman Clayson Monyela said military actions seemed to be an attempt to defeat the government.
"Although no one has declared that he has been attacked by government power, according to all, they are carrying the actions of the forest defense components of a sign of state shift," he said.
Military leaders of the Lesotho Kingdom said that the soldiers returned to their cabin on Sunday and there was a calm in the capital.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjo Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he was the first to attack for his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, Thabane has suspended parliamentary sessions for internal disputes, he has been stressed in Lesotho.
He stated that, despite the opposition, he did not subdue his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a minimum of 13 months
The production growth, according to a thoroughly monitored survey in August, slowed to a 13-month minimum in the euro area.
The final index of buying managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7 in August.
The number of more than 50 means expansion.
New orders and factories have damaged the increasing tension between the EU and Russia due to Ukraine.
The numbers come from the Thursday meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will require a clear plan for the bank to deal with remote recovery in the euro area and with a threat of inflation stagnating at 0.3 %.
The speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have pointed out this week is considering the quantitative releasing of the euro zone, similar to the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than any growth, the brake effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty on the manufacturer is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist Markit.
Germany’s PMI, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, has fallen to a minimum of 51.4 months.
In the second largest economic zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is a concern about France, Italy has resumed this stagnation.
The signs that the boosting power of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared is also not too calming,” Dobson said.
The slowdown of the industry is likely to put oil into fire by analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax stimuli.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the production overview of shopping managers in August is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
Producers in the euro area are currently very complex because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty trade has proved to be affected - and this is mostly the confidence of consumers, which will likely cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially those costly.
He stated that as "even more likely" it appears that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative release, "although we expect it to be limited."
10 years of survivors of Beslan: 10 years of horrors from occupied school children are still suffering
Ten years ago, Tschechian radicals at Beslan School in South Russia were arrested as a handheld.
During the suffering that took three days and that the world shocked, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of which were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school's death.
Just ten years after a terrifying school in Beslan, where 334 people, including 186 children, were killed, the heroes warned last night of surviving the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatic terrorist children and parents were arrested and murdered, it seemed to be the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to tragedy combined the east and the west, leading to action and future in this catastrophic accident.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school’s death.
We found amazing young people who suffered disaster, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will live in them.
What is their greatest desire?
The war that now destroys Ukraine - and in which children like them die - has already ended.
Girl trying to get back to the devastated school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov as she only tries to get back into the bombed school gym after the bombing bombing.
Aida desperately searched for her mother Lariss, who is now forty.
They were worried that both of them were dead, but they actually survived.
“A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn’t,” said Aida.
I had my legs from blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
She was saved by a soldier.
After a few operations, she thought she had been completely healed, but last night she said: “Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to do another surgery.
In my knees there were some pieces of screws.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people as doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t destroy it,” she said deliberately.
“It just happened to me and it can’t change.
One year I go to the gym to remind those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to friends about it.
This pain is too big.
My best friend and the future companion from Jerry Gapoev's class were killed there.
As a child, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to marry until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her detention, but her memories are a bit bright every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the internet, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from repeating.
The boy who escaped the rain of the ball and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia, children of school start at the age of seven) and survived three-day school dressing in the collection of his mother Tamary.
At that time, the seven-year-old said, "Mom told me that if the explosion occurred, I would lie on the ground and hold it in my hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Fly away."
He was afraid she was dead, ran away and saw crying balls on the road, fell the child in his hand and ran away from the shower balls.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
He says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara hit her freedom and laid her in the hospital with an injured leg and, on the contrary, thought her son was dead.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying for happiness.
I couldn't believe that.
He came in and knocked me.
Damir then went to London (news of the world’s missing newspapers), where he was then Prime Minister Tony Blairem and his wife Cherie declared a winner of Bernardo’s Children.
“This horror is coming back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are already bleached.
I remember that right after that I dropped all my guns to play.
Today I can play computer games in which I shoot, and I don't have a problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the kids I played at the courtyard and didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember a trip to London, especially how I could choose anything I wanted in the toy farm, and how I went to a cabrioleta.
But now he is concerned about places like Ukraine, where he and his friends suffer as much as he suffered from war.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I’m so sorry for everyone who has to go through such a horror,” says Damir, who participated in volunteering activities in the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
I want to work at the police and I hope they will take me to the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighbourhood, can you imagine it?
I remember that quiet after the attack, there were no children who were shouting and running here, and that quiet took a few months.
He remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally tell her that even if it's been ten years, I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's taste of a basket, and so all Russian restaurants were called.
Also, I remember how he played with the cowboys at the restaurant, Damir shot them out of the water gun and they fled and played with him.
And it was just a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, “I still think the world hasn’t changed in the past ten years to be better.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news that they will hear when they are bored or while they do something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what this is terrible.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and was a nice and quiet boy from him, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn’t want revenge, he doesn’t care about it at all.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's very close to six co-workers and sometimes she goes to the gym and burns candles there.
When he was younger, he had problems with it - I remember how he sometimes lay on a couch with a face turned away from us and sometimes lay for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had open eyes.
I also remember that he's throwing all his guns or other guns to play. Damir's 17 today, he's higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for a few hours that he was dead and that I will never see him again.
When I remembered after the explosion, and lifted up my legs, I looked around and saw the hell, everywhere lay pieces of human bodies.
I was absolutely sure my boyfriend had no chance to survive this hell.
“I remember how I shouted, ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced that he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and fled.
So, unlike others, our lives are far away.
Gregory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Beslan's survivor Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatimou after the 2004 attack, on the right of Grigorij today
When he ran away from his life after the Chechnya terrorist shot his colleagues, he was scared of his bleeding face.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of the beast in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, a 54-year-old doctor, put him on his first day at school and hurried to take her elderly son, Vladimir, to the university.
"I spent two minutes before the terrorists entered the court, so my boyfriend stayed there for three days alone," she said.
Not entirely alone because we had relatives there, but all of them died there.
He just survived my Gregory.
As the date approaches, it is increasingly difficult to think about it and talk about it.
It's not a day to remember that tragedy.
It doesn't matter to us that it has happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: The photo of Grigoria (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was nominated as a socha (right)
I remember how Grigory was greatly pleased that day at school, he said he wanted to take his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there is even a crying soda of Grigoria.
Grigory doesn't like the girl in this picture and we have her hidden in the library at home.
I understand it, but I also think that thanks to this picture, people around the world know what pain we feel.
Gregory said: “It’s important that this doesn’t happen again.
“I doubt that sometimes we will learn the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but no one ever knows the truth.
They are now investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
This world expects something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when people ask themselves, no one wants war as possible?
For ten years there is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, it takes tens of years.
It had an impact on my health, I still feel it.
I had three or four years because of a nightmare attack, but then it improved.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was frightened every day.
I thought of my friends and colleagues who killed.
When it comes to September 1, I’m going to the gym.
I want to worship the memory of friends from childhood.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I don't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to enter the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't do it because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't go.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived although he was held in the foot of a murderer
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was arrested during the attack under the foot of a murderous terrorist, yet he managed to survive
When the attack was in full stream, he was arrested in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the foot of a killer terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
“It looks like it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service, but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've thrown in my head.
Now I'm older and it's said that children with bad experience can handle better - I have to say that it's not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I was a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - year after - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I'm sorry.
I will never go there again and don't want to follow me to show you where I'm sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I take it with me every day.
Friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me to school.
As for physical health, I'm okay.
I have to be careful about my knees I've had in the morning, but I'm walking normally.
But I couldn’t go to the FBS Academy for health as I wanted.
I sent my documents to them, including medical reports, and answered that it was not possible.
My other interests are animals, so I went to the veterinarian.
I did the next year there.
He learns how to treat all animals from “cat to cow”.
He said, “I know I will never explain to my children.
It’s not something that children should know about and not anything that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain will always be here.
It's inside and it gets worse with the coming anniversary.
I will participate in memory ceremony.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God for bringing him back to me, and there are traces in Beslan everywhere.
He's staying with us.
Gregory is an adult today, but the horror is still on.
It is hard to accept if something so terriblely unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sport, but he can't do it for his knees.
He has been undergoing several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I would say that 50% already overcome the fear, but it can't be overcome completely and forget about it.
This terrible experience with us will always be.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbours have been killed and the pain is just worsening.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could give me, but the loss of the dead hurts me.
I know the families in which other children have been born, but also the widows who have not been married again.
It’s hard to assume that life goes further, even if you don’t want.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to fight together?
People and children are suffering, I am sure many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If we could collect all those rebels and kill them as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
Children who have brought a special command to safety
Saved: Alyon Tskaevu is carried to the safe Russian special command (left).
Now she is 10 (right) and doesn’t remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world collapsed after breathing when the small Alyon was taken in hand from a Russian police officer's imprisonment.
The terrorists let her go, but in jail at school they left her thirty-year-old mother, sister Kristina, and brother Makhara.
Makhar, who was three years ago, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and had a girl named Kristina after her deceased daughter with her new wife Slightlyne.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, has not remembered the attack at all and has grown up from her a wise and happy girl.
A close friend said that “it is a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great children.”
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep children away from the 10th anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to make better photos and videos under water
If you are interested in photographing or filming underwater, you have a wide range of equipment available.
The cheapest options are compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs around $300.
I made these pictures for a couple of photographers, all of them cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but to achieve the best results, several rules apply.
Check out your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
In addition, set the camera depending on the type of photographs or videos you will make.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenery or video mode that optimizes exposure to the dark underwater environment.
And before you go into it, find out how deeply you can immerse yourself with your equipment.
Some cameras are intended only to 5 feet, others to 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide by purchasing and evaluating digital cameras in regular and waterproof performance.
Always make a few pictures - a lot of them will not go away.
Compact cameras have LCDs that will help you make photos, but they don’t have it outdoors.
Although you have an LCD, it will be badly seen under water and the composition of the picture will be unpredictable.
So always make more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with a slightly different exposure spread, use it.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper light shine, it grows significantly.
If possible, keep yourself photographed in the pool, lakes or sea near the level.
It will also allow you to capture more light on the pictures - the deeper you float, the less color you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is a great advice if you photograph on dry ground, but underwater is even more important because of the thinner light.
This is particularly important if you record with an outdoor camera: such devices usually have a solid and wide angle of lens, which means that if you want to fill a photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a person whose personality power was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to avoid the sick from pain caused by diseases and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who asked for his help was the officer of MI6, who had to live with the consequences of torture that frozen him.
Lawson understands that while doctors focus on diagnosis and diseases, treated patients in the most part are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, it was the one who began to suffer.
“I don’t feel in my skin,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He encountered the influenza symptoms and found that he was intolerant and his wife Juliet included counts.
He said, "I want everything to happen sooner than later."
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusual and unexplained.
Something was wrong.
My friend made him a X-ray chest.
Two weeks before he skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came.
He had a mezothelium, an unhealthy tumor that affects the cough or lung excretion.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer have smoked.
Mezotelium is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause of exposure to asbest - a fiber-building material, which was previously referred to as "exclusive", but today it is known to be mortally dangerous.
It was not difficult for most of us to ignore mezotelis.
Asbest, ultimately, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s when it entered into force the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry.
Even at the time asbest was used, only certain groups of people came closely with him, such as isolation treasuries, builders, teasers and shipyard workers.
Toxins used in the industry in another era today are difficult to see as a reason for concerns.
Such selfishness is not in place.
In the UK, the mesothelium epidemic is at the top of today.
The number of deaths on mezotelium is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths to this disease are twice a year as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths due to mezotelium effects annually since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we are still feeling its effects, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were finally banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before mezotelis develop.
The cemetery in the form of mezotelium does not only concern the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and in many cases, he is still present in homes where we live, offices where we work, schools where we learn, and shops where we shop.
Mezotelium therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, occupation, or age.
Privilegiated bastards from London business homes to public schools do not represent a hiding.
Parliament is also full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which we should be treated are the warehouses of this mortal carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even put an isolation.
He tried to find out where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he came to it.
“It’s possible that a lot of asbestos was at Guy’s Hospital’s sudden stages, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and doorkeepers - walks were used.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question that he was able to answer partially.
"From four doctors who were in the Guy's Hospital and who later showed mezotelium in the last five years," the 2010 letter noted, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mezotelium when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55 years old.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not so usual for so long.
55% of people diagnosed with mezotelium will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are sick of the same disease?"
According to professor Julian Peta, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when an asbestos epidemic occurs in the UK, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them do not know that they will die in this way.
Asbestos in Quebec, Canada
When checking regularly in the archives of courts, to which disabled people are frequently turning and demanding compensation, it shows how much the mezotheliomic crash has expanded.
For example, in June, Marks & Spencer admitted that he had exhibited asbestos Janice Allen.
For the chain, she worked nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she watched in two stores on the clothing section - one of the locations was the company's flagship, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children over twenty.
"Before this happened," she says, "I never heard of mezotelium before, I rarely knew about azbest.
I never thought in my dream that it might be something about me.
There isn't a lot of people who know about asbestos.
In fact, asbest is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He received his name thanks to his fiber structure, which gives him strength and weakness.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most often, in buildings today, it is possible to find chryzotil, commonly known as white asbest.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boilers and even in brake cover.
It is not as fatal as other forms of asbestos, the EU and the WHO consider it to be a “great health risk” that can cause death.
The more dangerous is brown asbest (mosit) and blue asbest (crokydolitis).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbest and experts claim that “there is a convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of unusually high mezotelium [in the UK].”
Marsk & Spencer employees exhibited asbestos at the Oxford Street flag store in London
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mezotelium victim, but Juliana Peta's work indicates that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients argues that “a substantial part of the cases of mezotelium without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was likely due to an exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exhibition is due to the "usual use and ventilation" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which studied Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the central government don’t have to know that they may be exposed to asbest.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that service lifts and pipelines behind the Parliamentary Committee are contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fiber could be damaged by something as harmless as "the strong air stream."
Ministers are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but in this case it can be the opposite truth.
Although the Parliament’s Department of Services took the Westminster Palace to receive a “good medical certificate”, it is now counted that it will take a million pounds and a few years of work to be thoroughly reviewed by Parliament, modernized the Al-Qaron electricity and removed asbest in the center of the 2nd green spaces, and that after the Westminster elections in 2015, they will be more likely.
In Goddard’s report, “the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations.”
It is not possible to tell if this disagreement will cost life.
Everyone can just wait now.
One of the people who had never been able to determine when they had an exposure to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects that he was exposed to asbestos in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” she says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It’s hard to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he remembers the day of early December 2009 when something like a winter.
He was 45, he was in the evening and was just in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly, I broke up.
It's all right.
I was awful.
I thought I wasn't going to get a car home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain came out of the backbone, exacerbations around the lungs.
But just like Janice Allen had no reason to believe that it was a mezotel.
He finally spent a month at home.
The doctors made a X-ray to him and brought him a chest cateter to remove the fluid that they sent to him from the lung.
However, they did not determine the diagnosis.
His condition gradually improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after exercising and debt.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients with similar symptoms arrived at the surgery hall and was subsequently diagnosed with mezotelias.
But Abbott didn’t know anything about his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades old and went into direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s state again deteriorated and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he was introduced into the space between the breastplate and the lungs of a sond equipped with a camera.
I'm optimistic.
I tend to do nothing too much,” he says.
To be honest, I wasn't worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of biopsy came between Christmas and New Year: “They told me that it was a mezotel.”
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mezotelium
Abbott began to gather with sisters from the charitable organization Macmillan and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that time he realized the scope of the epidemic.
“It has proven that asbest has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbest heat insulation in pipelines,” he says.
In people who have been exposed to asbest in these buildings, the disease now begins to manifest itself.
This is why the intersection begins with younger people who do not have a risky job.
The most dangerous tubes, heat-insulated asbest, were located in the suterene in hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, members of the staff who walked through the sudden hallways between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or eating in sudden dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now shows, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of doctors who treated them.
Asbest is eliminated so far.
Students built Bunsen's kahan on asbest floors
And it's not just about the hospital.
Asbest was often used in offices, stores, libraries and municipalities because of its excellent insulation and non-combustion properties.
Also in schools.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbest floor.
A website addressing the issue of asbestos in schools has emerged.
Innocuous things such as floor floors or rooftops on tools in our homes usually contained asbest.
“This is an industrial toxin built into a large number of homes,” says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer representing Andrew Lawson in his complaint against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mezotelium was able to remember in the 1970s when she broke the garden house.
So be careful how you grow a garden house.
With the consciousness that the disease is unhealthy, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
“It takes a while before it happens,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I found that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the surgery room for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to get the next Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the doctor’s position to the patient’s position.
As an innumerable number of patients before him, he remembers how he felt confused with the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand all of this,” he said.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
It was told that twelve months.
I remember when I said, “Well, I’m not going to live next Christmas.
That's what it is."
Mezotelium is particularly destructive because the mechanism itself of what keeps us in life – the breathing itself – is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mezoteliom are caused by an asbestos exposure.
Asbest is a small fiber.
When asbest is broken and the fiber breathes, they can be settled in the membrane, the lung excretion.
Asbest fibers irritate and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is a breathed asbestos fiber in the form of a needle,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who entered Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
In the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxally the leading center in mezotelium treatment.
Treasure Lawsona knows and treats other patients who were likely exposed to asbestos during practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, and “soul breathing is pushing on the edge where the excretion is located.
His nature has been invasive from the very beginning.
In mezotelium, common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, we are discussing the effectiveness of the operation.
According to some, it would be a trial.
Treasures are disagreed.
“You can’t remove the confession,” he says.
You're missing the scalpel around her.
Cancer does not respond to chemotherapy, which is "have some effect", but does not cure.
“Sometimes someone who survives lung cancer will occur,” Treasure says.
But in the end, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live a lot longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After the discovery of the mezotelium, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years since his diagnosis, became an individual support and adviser for equally disabled people.
When they called, they were happy to introduce themselves: "Good day, you've got to the center of cancer."
“It was very positive,” Abbott said.
The disease was diagnosed four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and probably would only extend his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson “can show things in more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim from the breast surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until they sent me to him, but I just called there and they looked at me,” Graham admitted.
A normal patient should have received a request and should have approved the payment.
In order to get the best available treatment, the question of money is key for patients with mezotelium.
But when various treatments eventually fail inevitablely, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave here.
And that's why he goes to courts and wants compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgana from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbest has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even its very small amounts could pose a health risk.
And here we meet with the company's incompatibility.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally fixed themselves, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "complete compensation" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that the mezotelium was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the case investigation, spokesman Guy's Hospital confirmed that "association in the incriminated sudden part was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Exposing a mortal asbestos to one company or a place of work – usually decades after that – has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mezotelium seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed the owner or disrupted.
The evidence of insurance was lost.
And those who are now accused of obstacle have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation has been adopted this year, thanks to which it is easier for patients with mezotelium to demand compensations, even if their former employer cannot be monitored.
The law created a 350 million financial reserve that is paid by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no complaints.
In such a case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally allocate to them as a compensation - about £22,000.
300 successful applications are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mezotelium, thinks that £350 million is a “good job”.
“It’s a contract written by insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies should pay if they don’t have time and people with a mezotelium would be able to enter the former employer and in a normal way to charge them.
Even Mike Penning, former minister of labour and social affairs, admitted that the law "had misunderstandings."
But Penning and Morgan admit that due to the seven deaths every year, a quick action was needed.
"People suffer too much and need help right away," Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the law on mezotelium.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunskio 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Toma Treasura, he thought he had a positive effect.
After the surgery, radiation and chemotherapy was followed - a triangle treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski could boast about five years of survival in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott strengthened it.
“This isn’t the most important thing,” Abbott says.
You can always see it in patients.
There is something that drives you.
When you give up, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott was in operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Surveys have not shown any symptoms of the disease.
I went to further control in March [2014].
In my chest, I had a number of breastplates [cancers].
I just got my 50th birthday.
It doesn't threaten life.
Beer to it.
Abbott once again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumors in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think of practical things - financial assurance when I die, or to show a woman how a wake up on the coat works.
When you find out bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more tolerant.
She didn't say so much.
All patients with cancer must face such conversations.
In patients with mezotelium, however, such interviews are not delayed by hope or merely a sign of chance of survival.
Disease brings (and eventually brings Stephen Jay Gould) unpleasant certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, “because of the death, life is not threatened.”
The bodies of the nabalized Pharaohs are packed into an asbestos plate.
Asbest fibers are used to strengthen cooking shells and increase fire resistance.
Plinius Senior describes asbestos.
The fabric was invented, which is fireless.
I saw the bulbs made of it that shine in the hostages.
In Italy, asbest begins to appear in commercial use, it is used to produce paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos dolls open in Canada and South Africa, soon then in America, Italy and Russia.
During the industrial revolution, it is an excellent insulation in steam engines and turbines.
The global production of asbestos increases to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential insurance companies statistics detect higher mortality in people working with asbestos and then reject life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that asbest particles in her lungs “are certainly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
The employers of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, refused responsibility.
It does not pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships are constructed intensely, working in ships represents the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of importing blue asbestos
The appeal court confirms the first successful complaint about health damage due to an exposure to asbestos in the UK.
The global production of asbestos increases to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires all suppliers of asbestos to have a license.
Import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
The use of all kinds of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
In the United Kingdom, the Mezotelium Law enters into force.
350 million compensation programs have been launched.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbest is still used as cheap construction material.
World production holds two million tonnes per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong power to choose leadership – demonstrators promise revenge
Despite the mass discussion of the democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese parliament decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates to the 2017 election.
It is likely that this step will cause long-term protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists have begun to organize and crash only a few hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress in essence allows Communist leaders to issue any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it turned us out,” said Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
People in Hong Kong lied.
And it is clear that we have to do with the authoritative regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Fei, said that allowing public nomination in Hong Kong leadership elections would cause chaos.
Since 1997, when Britain returned China to Hong Kong, Beijing promises that citizens will be able to elect executive power from 2017.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic crossroads because Hong Kong allows direct voting, but it also makes it clear that Chinese leaders hold firmly in the nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after summer months that recorded one of Hong Kong’s biggest and most follow-up protests in a few years.
Among most pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong stands the Central Occupation Movement with love and peace, whose organizers threatened by the closure of the financial district, unless Beijing gives them the general voting right.
On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of fans of the Occupation movement in the rain gathered in front of the Hong Kong government’s headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement would enter the new stage of civil disobedience and the waves of protests would begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, obviously they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In his online statement, the organizers said that the movement “has considered the occupation of the Central as the last step in the event that all the options of dialogue are exhausted and there will be no other choice.
We must regret to announce that today all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the involvement of the Centre is inevitable.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing all day and strengthened the protection of the headquarters of the government on Sunday and placed police and barricades.
Anxiety stimulation, according to many Hong Kong residents, is a sign that they slowly lose control over the city.
The arrival of people from the fort increases competition in products and services.
They are also worried that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are a growing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Central Occupation Movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade - the Hong Kong rescue boat.
“The test that we are talking about could cause much bigger economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long,” said Regina Ip, a criticist of the long-term movement.
We do not want the concerns that Hong Kong gets out of control.
Such perception could harm investments.
The Chinese state media has also reported in recent days that Democratic activists in Hong Kong have depicted as counterfeit agents governed by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants – more than five voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
Pre-electional agitation?
Liga in Jihlava has a name by political movement
A small copan plays about 1,600 amateur athletes in the rural town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is newly named Joint for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that goes into the October municipal elections.
In addition, a tenth of his candidates is the boss of a small company in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
"There was a large crowd where there was no problem with it," Mr. Darka said.
The situation around the first league of the small bands was already engaged by the lawyers of the Jihad Council and recommended to change the grant distribution system.
The small company won around a million krone last year, according to the city's website.
This year, it's about hundreds of thousands.
According to the law, a small procedure is not in contradiction with the law or the directives of the magistrate.
The situation is, however, a stimulus for the Office to adjust the rules of grants and grants,” said the spokesman of the magistrate Radek Tulis.
Pumping grants from the city and at the same time expressing a small swap support in the elections of one political party, it will probably no longer go.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the high-speed "big" football.
It is necessary to create a country conquest, ODS division or KDU-CSL 1.
What about class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be for.
In contrast, I would like to turn to us by sponsors from a number of companies," said the President of the country's football union Miroslav Vrzáček.
The boss of the small football of another party and move to the title of the league will not leave
According to the small company players, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own space with six floors, clothes and social equipment.
"For example, the playground in Stoops is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapesh from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech milk.
In my opinion, however, there will be, for example, a senseless area for the scenery, which is about fifty in Jihlava," the Dark said.
Primator Jihlavy Jaroslav Deleted (ODS) responded that the small cabin uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Russia and Na Stoupách, which are the property of the city.
We want to build a playground that has the maximum use.
We are preparing to modernize or build sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon hours.
I think a huge progress has been made for the small copan in the last few years," he added.
Other political parties in the names of the League do not appear, according to Jan Mraky.
We have restrictions.
If someone from one sector comes into our partnership, we don’t give the other anymore,” he explained.
"Political movement on behalf of the league, I think it is at least a disagreement step," said the Board of Directors for Sports, Karel Voldan.
"But whether the voters assess whether Mr. Dark uses the community of Little Copenhagen Jihlava and the city's grants for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition enters university life – first-times can fly with a press plane
We are delighted to respond to demand by launching the first luxury travel services for students in the UK.
In order to make the best possible impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including private printer or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its security page.
Service is the ideal option for students who otherwise have to wear their stuff across the state in a dangerously charged car.
We look forward to our VIF (very important fresher – a very important element) variants this year to ensure students arrive at the university with minimal nervousness and maximum luxury.
The company spokeswoman said that because the services have just started, they have no bookings yet, but he added: “Students will start bookings in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students pay an annual school amounts to £9,000, it is expected that the service will find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are others with regard to expectations and desires - it’s more important than ever to do the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students criticized the service as an inaccessible.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is inaccessible.
Many students who go to university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to the train, because available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot take a step in increasing costs for basic needs.
Feminists fight racism and police behaviour after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of a month, a police officer in Ferguson killed an unarmed young man in Missouri.
Those who are waiting for the funeral with their hands rising are scanning: “Arms rising, do not shoot.”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri for the shooting of unarmed uncle Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez recorded a move in the online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and equality of income, white feminists prefer gender before race.
With the increasing tension in the Middle West, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noted that the reaction of white people is 100% focused on the race.
In comparison with the reactions of the blackshot shortly after the shooting on August 9, personal articles with titles such as “the thought of the whiteness over Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about the oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
Perez said that is an important change.
“I don’t think there’s a lot of people in the feminist movement to talk about race and privileges at this level,” she said.
People felt that what had happened must be expressed.
This is characteristic for the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially gained that they had to point out.
According to a professor of English at the state University of Ohio Korithy Mitchell, Ferguson put the problems faced by African-Americans every day and which are not perceived as “female questions” in the cultural sphere.
"I can publish funny stories of life on Facebook with my partner and get 150 people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colors are in their own country, it's silent.
“How is it possible for a woman to talk publicly about relationships, but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For blacks such as Mitchell, who deal with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no difference between the issues of race and gender disotomie.
The blacks couldn’t give them luxury in a clear way to divide these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although today’s white women are consistent with the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors were doing the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was, in almost all cases, rape of whites,” Hattery said.
In order to motivate the lynching, you needed a white co-operation.
According to Hattery, the breakthrough between white and black came when fighters like Susan B. Anthony studied the fields at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people could have the right to vote – women or blacks.
"They have decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and the right to focus on blacks later," Hattery said.
When we realize this, we get an important view of why colorful women don’t believe in whites.
We didn't do a good job.
We have never been able to protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years before they began to organize anti-lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was founded for 40 years after the Blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell’s response from the White Feminists to the issues that brought to the event in Ferguson – the question of police behaviour, racial discrimination – reflects the time when white Feminists had to “build” the questions with which Blacks faced the generation.
“It wouldn’t be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminist who made a career fight for reproductive law and access to contraception now find out what this means.
Significant feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown’s killing on Facebook, where they published Rebeccy Carroll’s column from the Guardian, calling for white Americans to protest more racially against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but yet similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society – and racial opinions that differ significantly in public opinion surveys – will strive to change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem is an intersectional feminism that includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America some people kill.
Expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, author of the book “Who stole feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colorful men, are “a lot more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinman’s comments are faced with the criticism that Ferguson raised earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost no for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program, which had to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it led to many feminists, including Glorie Stein's depicted reactions.
The relationship between the police and the Black community is not the only problem that comes in the interests of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police arrested nearly 63,000 youth in the southwest of the country without accompaniment this year, the issue of immigration law reform - this time as a women's issue, again arose.
Andrea Mercado, co-Chairman of We Belong Together, a women's immigration law reform organization, said that the only thing she had to do was to share immigrant stories in order to bring the question as necessary for women.
“I’m talking for myself,” says Mercadová.
Because most of the work permits are granted to men, women who come with them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have warmth in women’s organizations,” she said.
Pig residence in Ipswichi for sale
The real office removed an image of a house for sale in Suffolk - when she published it, she rested on it in the pork’s living room.
A single-room separate house for sale for £12,000 is on a private road in Ipswichi.
The information photos included an image of the living room, in which it rests with the head on the pig sofa.
The Real Office Connells stated that pigs on the photo are the pet owners.
“The photo was wrong there, and that’s why it was already removed,” the spokeswoman said.
In the real estate information, Connells’ real estate office described the former prayable as “a single single-room house.”
Although the office has already removed a photo from its websites, promotional materials still appear.
The sale of the house raised interest in social networks, where some asked whether pigs were included in the price.
After the win in the lottery, Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
He is searching for a new millionaire in the Southeast of Perth, one lucky lottery lottery on Saturday will take $1.1 million home.
Traffics in Harvey had been the second time in sharing happiness in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was a $1 million winning.
The lucky winner has only to sign up.
The store owner Steve Forward said the whole city was talking about victory in the southwest of Perth.
This is the main topic and everyone is disruptive.
We thought that a similar victory was touching.
Eight winner in Western Australia shared one victory last month, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires and just a couple of weeks earlier in Belmont won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winner couples put 20 years and said the victory would allow them to process the world and buy a new house.
The Harvey Millionaire is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia for this year, earning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains will not eat at night.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL marked the protest as a warning stake, for which he was deliberately elected out of the traffic point.
The GDL takes note of many people returning to the railway from the weekend until the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people who work during the day," the trade union said in a press release.
"Our first wage should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers already," GDL added.
DB has not yet published the official response to the bill.
It is not even clear how protests will affect international rail connections, among other things with the Czech Republic.
The committees require a five-percent increase in the wages of machine drivers and a two-hour shortening of working hours per week.
Currently, the average wage for machine drivers varies from 36 thousand to 46 thousand euros (998 thousand to 1.27 million kroons) per year, depending on the year-olds.
Machine drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to access salary growth when reducing working hours.
They emphasize that the salary assessment of machine drivers must develop as well as the other railroad personnel, for which DB is not counted by reducing the working week.
It threatened that Christ’s truck would start to burn.
That's why Barum Rallye is over.
What exactly happened?
It was a lack of material.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think that something like this could happen.
Was the exit temporarily fixed and continued to serve in a slower pace, where mechanics would exchange it?
If we were straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more erects, and it didn't work.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car to start burning was large.
I can't afford that.
You've managed five speed tests at a full pace.
What kind of impression did you have of them?
Very good.
I felt like a youth.
We were faster while I didn't go over the vint.
Everything was caused by the car piping for more than a half year to be at some level.
The race proved that we succeeded.
You put him in such a way that you could really think of victory.
I made the car and myself so that we really had to win.
The work didn't come out.
On the other hand, the result we could think about did not happen.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technician said no.
You weren't the only one of the tops who left the battle for the championship.
There are also foreign favorites of Breen, Abbring or Lappi.
Have you been surprised that so many favorites have left?
Yeah, yeah.
Mostly, it was a shame for the spectators because the race was over early.
Jaromír Tarabus was on the top for a long time.
However, he added that he dropped out of the line and took nearly two minutes shortages.
How did you be satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degree of winner.
He was in the first two times.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was good.
He went very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared on the Barum rally start.
Can a good feeling of driving again make a regular rally racing participant?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Last year I said that Barumka was my last race, and yet I didn't.
I decided to take her back.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there's a chance again in a year, I'll probably go there.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the trail just for you.
Did that please you?
We started to a certain extent just because of them.
Many people, known or unknown, are constantly asking if I'm going to go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team continues.
We'll go to Vyškova next week, where Robert Adolf's race will be.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow from us for this race.
We are waiting for a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do this, we'll have to get things up for next year.
Can you suggest something?
No, nothing is decided.
When the Corsical rallye was part of the world championship, you reached your maximum at the fifth place in the series.
Can't you try the trail again?
It doesn't.
Oral agreement with an employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you didn’t have to issue a doctor’s confirmation of work inability, which serves as a proof for the organization that you can’t carry out your job duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately report the absents to the employer.
The agreement then concluded that certain days would be considered a vacation, but the agreement took place only orally.
Although the labour law does not require the obligation to keep the consent of the employer with a pumping vacation in writing, this procedure has been certified in practice.
If only an oral contract occurs, you have no confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the pumping of vacation, as in your case, may be denied and the absence at work be considered as a long-term unexpected absence, thus a reason for the immediate cancellation of the employment relationship under § 53 of the Labour Act.
In the case of a legal dispute on the contract, the employer has no proof.
However, the working relationship with you has not been cancelled under § 53, you only have the data specified in the account list as an unexpected absence.
The unconditional absence in the account list does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g., the impotence of taking material unemployment security), however, it is difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and keep confirming in writing that the accident has actually occurred, as a result of which you were unable to work (this is not the so-called "discrimination", it is only a doctor's documentation).
When looking for a new job, you can submit the document and explain the situation.
In practice it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of work inability and the prompt notice of the employer or the request of written consent with pumping leave.
You avoid such complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on returning to the trail
The return to the line ended for Tony Stewart just a bit behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway racing route.
Stewart hit the game for the second time after his right front tire broke in 172, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought the denied car into the garage, he didn't express himself to reporters and left.
The Chief of his team, Chad Johnston, said the 14th car team was disappointed, but he will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I would like to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we'll have more.
Stewart hit the game for the first time in a Sunday evening race after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required a correction of his right side of the car.
Johnston added: “Today, we have put hope for a good finish,” he added, “it just didn’t happen.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team was packed and ready to leave.
After his car attacked and killed another driver at a New York racing, Stewart released three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to get a place in the table.
He returned to the race during the tragic investigation of a tragic accident in which he died, a 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who entered Stewart during the race.
The authorities said that the investigation into the cause of the accident will take at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
Three-time championships were encouraged before the race.
Stewart started at 12th place, he worked at 10th at the start of the race, and then even at 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd wheel, Busch's car number.
18 got out of control, went out of the second round and hit Stewart, sending both cars to play.
Stewart continued, but went down to the 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi manager, earning 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection procedure for the new manager of the offices of the taxi service.
With 103 parking spaces, he gets about 12.3 million krone per year.
Last year, the taxi drivers picked up 150,000 crowns annually for the same locations.
He informed the Council of Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past, the city used logging in the selection of managers.
The winner then got a rent for a pausal amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
Currently, the sum of the offer is choosing.
"The year since the announcement of the original rental contracts and the opening of the auction has proved that the new rental system is far more profitable and generally fair for Prague," the council said.
The most expensive flek is Na Pershtina
The highest price was offered by stakeholders to stay in Na Perština street.
They pay 2.1 million krones per year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by new administrators for places in front of the General House or the Václavsky Square.
The new rules for renting the premises of the taxi service were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year, the original lease contracts were issued.
The selection proceedings took place in four waves and the new manager found 29 positions.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the hole.
We let her go all the time, creating a nearly second fisherman around the chamber.
Then we hired Savo there.
It's an incredible puch!
Our fountain in the cloth has always shine enough fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, his grandfather gave her her her help.
It's been a long time ago.
She was just three-scrolls, and in general, she's all in the house, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until the year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
When she stayed there for several months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water wasn’t watering.
We wondered if something happened there.
In the place where the pump went, it was possible for a little sadness, the board did not go there quite, so a hole was sealed by the body.
Our inspectors confirmed that he was moving.
Otherwise, nothing was seen in the water, and that's what we told her to the bottom.
So we let it go again and clean it up.
Of course, we improved the improvised thickness around the pipe pump.
We noticed strange things in the hall.
There was a bunch of bones on the ground.
That's what it looks like.
And a bit further.
Now it looked like a mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where there are flows, grandfather's invention, there were residues of fish!
And it's hard to go!
Our store is selfish as well.
Someone would say that grandfather had just deceived the chat.
And it wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and floors are only dirty sand, only the ceiling is soaked.
The boats are mainly there.
The car.
And the beach leaflet.
The doors with wide scales were usually open as somebody walked there in one piece.
At the ceiling there are several of the above-mentioned flows.
Without a network, so the birds are typically buried there, and they build a hook on the trails.
The mouse is unnecessary to mention.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and that's it again.
The air hasn't helped.
The whole store smells.
So we cleaned the whole cloth.
Especially the fish on the tram was nutritious!
We also threw out things around them: brush, heraclithic plate, and so on.
Our house at a distance welcomed the surrounding disinfectant area.
We've been thinking, who could get us all the delicious remains there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away from the village.
It'd be hard to come to us.
A neighbour attacked his grandfather who wasn't all right.
If he didn't give us the dishonesty in the way?
There's almost a year, stupid ideas, that's him.
We decided to take care of and regularly check the hedge.
After a few days, everything was okay.
We started using water again, just for washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Tahat water from a forest stud is nothing I would like to do for a long time.
One day we heard a terrible anxiety shout of our fans.
Mom looked at her from the balcony and saw her in the grass next to the veranda a long, strong black cake.
The grid crashed over her and crushed like a madman.
Mom spent it on her because she thought that Réza had earned the waste bag from the washing machine.
Suddenly, however, it was partially smoked into the club and partially stirred up.
There was a smoke on the balcony.
The grid got a hysterical invasion.
We went downstairs.
The bulb, long over meters and thick like a cow, was about to swallow a huge oil and the Reza defended her in that.
It was unclear if she wanted to save the oil or if she wanted to crash it alone, but it was unimportant.
When the bulb saw the moves in the form of our whole family, she probably said we would then sit down when we were so hungry, and she elegantly stretched through the stream into the cloak.
We were flying behind her.
It's like a lightning jumping to the bow.
By the way, we recorded another fragrant package on her board.
According to the smell, it's probably fish.
The predecessor wasn't there!
Our new safety around the pump was a little sharp.
And that's what we shut down even during the day.
You'd...
We went out there and each of us went to one stream.
We didn't wait for a long time.
That's a sharp thing for the cave.
First, a flat head with yellow moons on the neck appeared.
Then the whole bowl was thrown out on the stove.
She turned around the pump and began to get inside.
An exorcised employer was arrogant, bought laptops at the company and sold them.
After the release, an embarrassed employee purchased a computer company and then sold it.
He was able to spend the money before the police were detained.
In a short period of time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for over two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks to Olomouce, where he sold them after bazars," said Chumper police chief Rostislav Brückner.
The motive of fraud was the city of employers for release, as well as money gain.
"In an interview, he claimed that he was spending money on loan payments," Brückner said.
Police also found that the fraud is a pathological player who repeatedly treated himself in psychiatry.
Money could also end in winning devices or in video lottery terminals.
“It’s often that we didn’t find any money,” said the Commissioner.
A fraudman who was once punished for theft is now in danger of staying in prison for a year to five years.
Police have not yet told whether the penalty is also threatened to bazars who have bought and sold laptops below the price.
"It is true that they have taken completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the Commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazar have been accused.
Come on, a little bit, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague.
This year, the organizers made a few changes to us.
This was the biggest change of the route that brought the target on the wheel instead of bringing it back to the Yellow Bathrooms.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I wanted to experience it so little on the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally heal our readers at the stand, where we photographed together and recorded videos.
To achieve my view of perfection on the other hand, I accepted the role of personal leader.
Together with the girlfriend Katia, we listened to the end of the 60 to 70 minutes before the start.
We greeted friends who walked around us into the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of hot springs, turn on sports testers, calculation and start!
The screaming of the jasota, but instead of a quick start, followed a cupping to the start line.
After five minutes, we get to the gate, start the measurement and break the pace at 10:00.
We're flying with the yellow boobs of runners who run their first race, like Katia.
So far, all the fresh looks, the slow down sun on the cloud provides views of the Vyšehrad nearly to a boiling breath.
The pulsing meat that draws across the coast looks like the whole Prague runs here.
On the shore between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, traditionally begins to show who has how many powers.
A light rack on the Palace Square forces many runners to slow down or go on a walk.
Just before the transition to the Theatre I see a police escort and immediately after him Flights Vitek Pavlišta with an incredible pace to the destination.
I hear the stunning breathing of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the trail, I encourage him to cry with me, but just before that, he'll fall under my feet and our hands will swallow.
The Theatre Street gives you a chance for a short rest and breathtaking.
There are places in front of us to breathe.
The island on the bridge of Mannes shows Prague in all the beauty of the sun rising.
I don't breathe and my legs are carrying me almost alone.
For the first time, there is a moment of truth.
On the road, Katia will cross over the ribbon and bring a jump to the sea.
I look at if he doesn’t need help, and I start a series of encouraging words so that he doesn’t have time to think of pain.
It is one of the narrowest places of the trail, it is not drinking any more at this stage of the race, but it is necessary to watch the surroundings well.
I still don’t know that the most narrowest place is getting its true meaning later.
At the Praha gate, we are freneticly encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I'm trying to push myself with anyone who offers a hand, and I'm happy with Cate, because ten pushes with fans are like half an energy cup.
The fact is that it works, we accelerate again, and whether we have been quite significantly defeated, now the ride has begun.
We're going through dozens of runners, when I'm missing someone particularly tired, I'm trying to encourage him a few words: "Come a little bit later, you'll be able to do it."
No one expects us to be the last one, we're accelerating.
We've run for an hour and a quarter, adds, there's nothing to wait.
Three kilometers to the destination will hurt, but you really need to get rid of it.
The sun is slowly late and the day ends symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last ride on the bridge, the rotation, and just the level to the destination.
What's the pace we're going on? What's the point where this girl's going on?
"Come, let's go under 13:00, let's go!"
We're trying it, we're trying it, and here's the goal.
Hour 13 and 6 seconds.
Well, what can you do?
The coach set a 20-hour limit.
So seven minutes under the plan.
That's a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katte's legs are shaken, I help her to get rid of the wrists where she's resting for a while.
There is exaggeration, but also luck from well-realized performance.
After a while, I’ll slowly get her out of the target area.
Euphoria doesn't give us any idea about the printer in passages to clothes.
Here's what we can see that the Kozy Street was not the narrowest place.
This is so far behind the goal of an invasion that is under pressure of nearly ten thousand runners forced to crash.
If someone doesn't like dancing, it's not a place for him.
I'm also losing my head after a moment and wondering if these beautiful views and compared to last flights, the more interesting route was worth what's going on in the target.
From my own experience I know that organizing a race is not fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, the rich accompanying programme and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transportation is a huge challenge.
This year’s route change showed the drivers a lot of interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere dispersed in the Yellow Baths moved between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the trail and random viewers graduated it on each meter of the trail.
During the city's historic centre, unfortunately, I have to count on obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of the mass race in a place on one side of the walls and on the other side of the river the best solution.
If I say that the race has ended by running the goal, I'll consider it very well.
I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but finally everything went well.
Write to us for a discussion if you liked the track and what you say about the target situation.
Prisoners in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison officials throughout Bulgaria attended an international protest meeting before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
At peaceful demonstrations, they repeated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have changed in recent times.
There are also higher wages on the list of demands to be discussed with the temporary minister of justice, Christ Ivanov.
The supervisors of the month symbolically protested against the new working time and asked for a return to the original twenty-four-hour exchanges.
Although prison supervisors and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
“The negotiations are still underway,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the BNR General Directorate of Prison Service.
It is also expected that members of the Federation of Union Staff Organizations in the Ministry of the Interior will join the protests of the prison service staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we don’t see them
Physicians usually don't write bestsellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University succeeded in a black hit in 1999.
His book The Elegant Space has become the most accessible way to penetrate the mosquitoes of problems that a number of theoretical physicians face today - trying to unite two greatly functioning, but incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is that in the case of searching for a united physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The basic physical problem between the two key theories (always at this time our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) has been addressed and is thus addressed by the idea that it is worth translating and fans.
In addition, Greene has consulted so much fresh and excitingly that he cannot count how interesting he has not included in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "feat" mostly in two other books: the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality.
Obviously, the author would not object to his book to aging faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost all the essentials that an informed will with ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is relatively likely that in the coming years there will be only a little bit more living in this area (because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's inviolably open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions, can certainly sound sophisticated, fantastic, strange or mystical.
However, it is concrete and fully acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our views from the universe as a whole to something more landscaped, particularly to a long and thin garden hut for floating.
Imagine that you can download a centimeter garden pad from one side of the canyon to the other and watch the entire scenery from a half-kilometer distance (like on the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long, horizontally trapped hood, but if you do not suffer bystroair, the thickness of the hood is hardly distinguished.
Due to your great distance from the hammer, you would think that a forced hammer has only one dimension in which you can walk: the left-right dimension along the hammer.
When someone asks you where the rabbit was at the given moment, you will answer him with only one signal: the distance of the rabbit from the left (or right) end of the rabbit.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of cage looks like a single-dimensional object.
In the real world, it has thickness.
If we're all bigger, we'll see the second dimension suddenly - in the form of a circle hanging a hook.
In such an increased view, it is evident that the mower can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hood, but also in the "dimension in/in the direction of the movement of the hour handles", i.e. around the circle of the hood.
You begin to understand that to determine the location of a small row, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the row and where it is on the circle of a hanging row.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the cord is two-dimensional (e.g., experts will notice that this chapter is focused purely on the disorder theory of the strings.
Non-progressive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.)
The surface of the wheel is two-dimensional: one long long dimension is shown with a direct screw, the dimension in the direction of the circuit, marked with a circular screw, is short and swirled.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hole is long and easy to see.
The size of the hanging circle of the coat is short, "white" and worse noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to explore the hammer with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of space dimensions.
They are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, wide, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, swine, and much worse observed.
Of course, in that case, we did not just overcome to reveal the "swintuous" dimensions related to the thickness of the coat.
It's enough to help a television.
But if the hammers were thiner - like hair or capillary - we would only reveal the swine dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent his article to Einstein, in which he gave a stunning idea that space geometry could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
His radical assertion of Kaluz justified by providing an additional dimension with an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be linked to a single, unified concept structure.
Immediately, the question of how this Kaluz’s perception goes together with the obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of space.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and clearly expressed and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926 stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe may have both large and twisted dimensions.
This means that, just like the dimension in the direction of the length of the cord, our universe has three large, wide and easily visible dimensions, the existence of which we realize at every moment.
But analogously with the circle of the garden cage, the space can also have additional dimensions, solidly wrapped into the space so intact that they have remained hidden from our most perfect experimental apparatus so far.
In order to get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz’s remarkable proposal, let’s stay at the back for a while.
Imagine that we draw a relatively dense range of circles in the circle circle.
It looks far away like a thin one-dimensional line.
With a remote view now, thanks to the drawing, we reveal the swine dimensions still tolerated, for we will see the motive from Figure 2.
Clearly, we see that the surface of the clay is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and round.
Kaluz and Klein have come with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but besides one small circle dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, which is, together, four-spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little, let’s look at the illustrations in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small round dimension.
On the picture we increase the view of the space geometry similar to the one we increased the surface of the hood.
Each of the following levels represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our space may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are crushed into enough small space; thus we explain that we have not yet observed them directly.
The square network represents the commonly known "big" dimensions, while the circles are new, small and swine dimensions.
Just like cords in a densely stretched cover, even these circles exist in every place of ordinary dimensions - we only draw them into a square grid for sights only.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the common world around us - in common measurements such as meters,visualized by the side of a small square in a square network.
On each of the following images, we will focus on the small area of the previous image; we will increase it to become visible.
Initially, there is nothing special to happen, as we see at the first few levels of increases.
However, when we go on our way to the microscopic properties of space geometry further - at the fourth level of enlargement in Figure 3 -, we see a sudden new circle in the shape of a twisted dimension, similar to the sharks even in a thick-woven piece of cover.
Kaluza and Klein have come with the idea that an additional circle dimension exists in every place in the direction of larger dimensions similarly as it has a circle circuit in each point of its length.
In the interests of visibility, we have drawn the circular dimension only in some regularly placed points.
Figure 4 summarizes the idea of Kaluzo and Klein's microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the strike is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-departing spatial dimensions (of which we only drawn two), but the hammer has only one large dimension.
The more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the space itself, not just about an object within the space, such as our craftsman.
But the basic thought is the same.
If an additional circle-switched dimension is extremely miniaturous, it is much harder to recognize - as well as the circle of the hood - than to observe obvious, large and wide dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed even above the strength of our modern enlargement tools.
But most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a blank back inside the usual dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration incorrectly indicates.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common broad dimensions.
It is the dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as well as the dimensions of the upper-dollar, the left-right and the front-rear independent (and round) each other.
A small bulb can move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position, we would need four data, except three more ordinary positions in the circle dimension; if we also count time, then the data five, at least one more than we normally expected.

The price of the e-book is 149.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that being aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein’s thoughts show that there is no exception to the existence of additional varied dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with just an eye.
How small should they be?
The most modern technical equipment can recognize the structure of a large billion meter.
Smaller pork sizes can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined the original Kaluz's idea with several ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional round dimensions could be the size of about one Planck length, i.e. the size far beyond the skill capabilities of today’s devices.
Since then, physicians have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluz-Klein theory.
Avoid Honza Homola advises how to exercise on an electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "Twelve" consists of a twelve-year-old harmonic form that you can repeat anyway.
Whoever draws in the music theory finds its principle detailed here.
Jan Homola was not Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a lottery and a lottery leader whose Facebook profile can be watched here, he has been living as a graphic from maturity 20 years ago.
He is a guitarist of the fleet, from which he is unfortunately unable to leave.
The guitar is after his father, as is the brother Matthew, the leader of the Woheys.
Start with training on a single string.
"The rhythmic model is only on you, you can imagine anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the Twelve," Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen to Honz and watch what you can think of with the twelfth harmony on the two strings and how beautiful it begins to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already cock some songs with the melody.
When you finally add the fourth, be careful to change the layout, Honza notes in the video.
The next time Honza comes back to the Pentagon and you'll try to put it together just with twelve.
So, practice her honestly.
Best of all, you can read this in an interview with John Homolo at the first lesson of his school game for electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It’s not for a great celebration, acknowledges the castle Dwořák
We take the point and we love it.
The first half-time we had more chances, the second home," the attacker, who scored this time from the punishment cup.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but he was accompanied by a huge sand?
I didn’t see it particularly, even though at the second door where home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You've been punished for half an hour, but you've also got the goal from the penalty for less than four minutes.
What's wrong?
We slept at the beginning, we were passive, we came from that corner and then a penalty.
After that you got up and for the first half you were a better team with more chances.
Why did this change after the break?
It's hard to say.
I agree that we played well on the invased goal until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game after her, but we couldn't do it.
To tell the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it’s also true that they’ve said something about a break at home about their game, maybe they’re not very satisfied with it.
You’ve only scored the first time at the competitor’s playground, while you probably haven’t even got a goal at home.
Why is that such a difference?
I wouldn't say it's such a difference, rather, it's up to us how to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Plzen, that's another category.
You've been waiting for the goal, didn't you fear that after the previous match it might be similar?
It may not be, but of course we are glad that we don’t have to listen to the last match about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added another without expectation, but there are only three in six matches, which is still not for a big celebration.
Iceland - the lave arrives from a kilometer away crater.
A lake flying on the surface in the Holuhraun area near the ice Vatnajökull, accompany the underground tunnel from a kilometer away crater.
It is located under the ice cream, as well as part of the mentioned underground layer tunnel.
This fact now makes the scientists worried most about...
The situation is still unchanged.
From yesterday morning (31.8)
2014) still flys out of the bowl approximately the same amount of leaf.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to previous eruptions from 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
Scientists, however, fear that the tunnel can be opened even in places where it is under ice.
In addition, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the river Jökulsá á Fjöllum and on other rivers.
In the vicinity of the eruption it feels a strong smell of syrup, clouds of steam and gas rise from the throat.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was in the case of an eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are much more gases here,” says vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the mornings it was almost windless in the area.
The traces of sandy storms were smitten by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The Orange Degree (second highest) applies to Barðarbung and the Yellow (third) for Ask.
The sky over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She passed through the wings
Aerial day in Chebu.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, Peggy Walentin’s airplane acrobat was introduced, which dropped from the cockpit to a monster on the top of the two-scale wing, and also between the wings.
It is only for the strength of the muscles.
The airline day in Chebu took place this year's fifth and the organizers were able to prepare a few interesting airpieces again.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only "winding through the wings" by introducing the German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary hunter P-51 D Mustang or the Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew his attention to himself with his brilliant deck.
The acrobation called Wingwalking originates in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots were attempted.
However, due to a large number of deadly injuries, it was prohibited.
Today, however, he is slowly returning to the flight schedule.
Peggy will get out of the cockpit to the upper wing after the start.
There he presents various exercises.
At the end of the show, she moves into the space between the wings of an airplane where her show continues," Luděk Matéjíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the day of the airplane.
Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If the Peggy performance was the main gravure of the program, then the next gravure of Mustang was a famous cake sweater.
The legendary hunter arrived on the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in the curtain (such as numbers).
The airplane fans in the Czech Republic could see this one for the first time.
Pilot Miroslav Sazavski then introduced a breath of acrobacy with a plane from 1945.
He was made for wars, but he probably never participated in it.
He was included in military reserves.
Since 1963, he has been in a civilian sphere.
Even as a race plane.
Today he has his own home hanger at the airport in Munich.
The same place is also another Cheb Airline Day pearl, the two-motor Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
There wasn't a huge machine to look at at the airport.
His excited aluminum coating lighted up to a distance.
The admirer also acquired the Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard machine in the colors of French aviation.
A small transport aircraft was surprised by the denied Turbolet and a German delegation from Hofu took part of the German delegation to the flight day.
German neighbours in Chebu introduced themselves with reconstructed aircraft as 18T or a three-member formation of the Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return in front of the camera!
Lucie Borhy's parental concerns were exchanged for the work for at least tonight.
Stress or nervousness - a blonde moderator does not obviously know anything.
It was a good way to moderate TV news, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It’s only two weeks when the blonde ended six months, where women experience the biggest stress after birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news report TV Nova.
Regular return is expected, according to Blesk.cz information up to a month.
Just her daughter Linda needs her now more than a television audience.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a black hit.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
If it's going to be sold, it's planned to break the game
It would be worthy if something like this had happened during the World Cup.
"But it matters how the bond will be made," he said in Jihlava after an exhibit called the Golden Race, in which the captured Nagan team again met.
Even the players who participated in the gold hatch.
Players should taste, aren't they?
Sure, I'm sure.
It would be a good thing to make a break with the golden generation during the championship.
I think they can find one and two days during the tournament, when it's totally free and where such a match can be inserted.
Let's say that to Gum (Jürim Šlegro) or Béd Ščerban (organiser of the Jihad match) who would take care of it...
Arena would be sold.
But what if you play with New Jersey play-off?
So when I'm flying...
You don’t want to play in the representation.
Or did the Jihad meeting somehow change your decision?
Representations and exhibition competitions are two different things and in the representation are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially for the World Championships.
There should be a ride for players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has never changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan search?
It was just a great deal to meet the players.
A man has revived his stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for fans, but also for us hockey players.
The most important thing was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that it’s leaving a generation that really deserves it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek as a substitute.
Will you still enjoy your first match?
It's not forgotten about such things.
It was against Calgary Flames and three young people: I, Robert Holick and Robert Reichel, we joined in one three.
This was the first representation start for everyone.
Well, if we'd dominate somehow, that can't be said.
In Jihlava for a long time, Dominik Hašek caught.
What did you say about his performance?
My name is never surprised by the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can't (Hashek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end in the representation).
The bulb also appeared greatly.
He was trained with me once at night and there he was a kidnapper.
And now he's caught famously.
First, the United States and then the Netherlands begins qualifications for footballers.
The NH Hotel is hosted by prominent guests on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, the bracketer Petra Čech from Chelsea, the representative coach Pavl Vrb...
And here, that character in a black shit, that's Tom's Russian!
Arsenal and the captain of the representation arrived at a raid of about half twelve among the last.
We are looking forward to a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
“Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said when he was already present in the conference before the journalist.
Czech Representation Program
Monday, September 1st: the beginning of the crash, the first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramma (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) End of the collapse
Russian and sex fans can support even before the match against the U.S. on Wednesday (20:15).
The conference opened a Tuesday training, which begins at 18:30 a.m.
And then there will be an autograph that neither Russian nor Czech will miss.
Otherwise, this disaster of the national team will be calmer.
What is the praise of the coach Vrba, who just complained about a lot of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will devote ourselves to what we want to devote ourselves to.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It’s an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to train things that haven't been so long before," Vrba, who is officially led by the national team since January, said.
The Czech football representation will be carried out by the Musketeer image when entering the new qualification cycle.
The Representation has three matches behind her, all ready.
With Norway and Finland, she lost 2:2 and with Austria, she lost 1:2.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's right now.
The game with the Netherlands starts qualifying for the 2016 European Championship.
The Czech crew would, of course, help if it could be a general against the United States.
The first half of the year was to meet.

Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A British woman describes how she thought she would die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After having been diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenagers assuming she had only left a few years of life.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charitative organization CMT UK stated that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is believed that in the UK there are about 23,000 people suffering from CMT, which may manifest symptoms in the area of motorism such as muscle weakness, non-motor walking and broken fingers on the leg.
In patients affected may also occur insensitivity or pain, this condition is unhealthy and progressive, meaning that over time the symptoms get worse.
When Rodgers was thirteen, he thought he was suffering from Freidreich Ataxia (FA) - a disease that has a very bad prognosis.
She believed that before she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be placed on a wheelchair and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children who are now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell down every day and everything took me longer.
I could never ride with other children on a wheelchair or skateboard and I was shit down at school because of how I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was thirteen and had been after several operations that had to release her Achill's sweats and correct her walker, she took advantage of her doctor leaving the room, and looked at her documentation where she found out she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I promised, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I returned home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he said.
When they answered, I was shocked, I was completely panicked.
I thought before I was eighteen, I'd end my car, and before I was fifty-five, I'd be dead, and I'd gradually lose all my skills.
I was alone and I planned a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk wasn’t worse as much as she assumed, and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up and said to her, “Dear, I don’t think you’re sick, otherwise you’d be on the car.
I think it will be much less dangerous to life.”
After several genetic tests, it was found that it had CMT.
“When he explained what the CMT is, I thought I was a baby.”
The charitable organization CMT UK launched a month of CMT information to warn about this disease.
Washington’s entrepreneurs: with the economy’s turning up taxes
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And also higher taxes.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of companies in the country with a slight increase in the recovery of the economy last year and Washington companies were not an exception.
Maryland and Virginia entrepreneurs, together for the fiscal year 2013, took $27.6 billion to state and local treasures, which is 3.8% higher than $26.6 billion to be selected in 2012.
Tax burden - state and local - rose by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9 per cent last year, and it was the third year of growth after 2009 and 2010 when taxes declined.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased by 4.3% faster than local withdrawals, by 3.9%.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 percent, is from the livelihood tax, and 36 percent of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28 percent, shows the relatively lowest tax revenue from businesses.
The researchers argue that the majority of the increase in tax revenue comes from an increase in the value of real estate to companies, which increases the real estate tax this year after three years with a growth of -1 percent by 3.7 percent.
Although most profits come from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vriginia paid over $10 billion last year on state and local real estate taxes, which represents an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, a clear increase in the value of real estate does not exceed the state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where the real estate tax represents less than five corporate taxes.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., the real estate tax represents nearly half of the state and local tax.
“In Maryland, a lot of real estate belongs to companies, especially the base of taxes around D.C., government or non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes,” Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation, explained.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income tax, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other countries.
Recent increases in business tax revenue cannot only be attributed to a recovering real estate market.
According to data, revenues from business also appear to rise.
Companies in the region have published the revenue tax of businesses $2.3 billion, rising from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has chosen one billion dollars, most in the region.
Although they are taken in the same direction, the local tax burden of entrepreneurs does not grow in these three places as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia, the tax increase was below the average by 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax from all three rounds (all have the same taxes) of 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 %, while the average D.C. remains relatively high at 9,975 %.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally favourable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a corporate tax reduction law from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and the tax will fall to 5% next year.
If the country will continue to meet the revenue targets in the coming year, the tax rate of revenue as set out by the Act in 2017 could be reduced to up to 3 %.
According to a recent study with small entrepreneurs in Washington, it leads better, so higher state and local taxes are paid.
Life-tax deducted by small businesses as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for cost increases by price increases, according to which most companies are organized - rose by 20% in D.C., Maryland and Virginia last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers argue that the trend and national increase in livestock tax will likely continue next year, total sales tax revenues for state and local governments will rise to 6.2% compared to the same period in the first three quarters of 2014 last year.
However, Washington can stop behind others because the reduction in state expenditure is choosing its tax on the labour market.
What did you escape: the boss of Europe will be Tusk, Putin Novorusko and Lafat's knives
Will a new state rise in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on New Russia
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government units have been fighting with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current anti-Russian sanctions regime they would have difficulty returning to the Russian market.
The support given to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is opposed to democratic values.
The ending of the conflict is dependent on Kyiv, so it cannot be said when the Ukrainian crisis is ending.
Other sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has been entitled to disagree with part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, will propose the form of further alignment of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, decided the EU summit tonight.
This was told to reporters by the permanent President of the Member States’ meeting, Herman Van Rompuy.
According to the Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Saturday, specific proposals for the development of the forms of sanctions should be prepared on Monday.
Tusk will be a new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected head of the European Council at the European Union summit, namely, the so-called EU President, who leads the summits of Member States.
From December to two and a half years, Herman Van Rompuye will be replaced.
In the head of European diplomacy, Catherine Ashton is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, must still be confirmed by the European Parliament.

Stanislav Huml, a member of the Czech Republic, is clear about who shot a Malaysian aircraft over Ukraine.
According to him, "the strong sanctions declared in terms of the shooting of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
According to the lawyer, the CIA's handwriting is also known.
Incomplete promises.
The elections are coming, and the parties offer it impossible again.
End of homeless in the streets, parking for every family and lanovette over Prague.
This is repeated before every election: the parties promise it is impossible.
And now, with the coming municipal elections, politicians are preventing who prefers voters more.

Joan Rivers' family: "We hold our fingers"
Joan Rivers has been in consciousness for three days since she was taken to the hospital in New York City, but her daughter has expressed herself today that she does not lose hope that a 18-year-old comic will be healed.
“Thank you for your greeting and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a phone call to a rescue service, according to which she had a heart attack on a Yorkville endoscopie in Upper East Side, according to a source.
Doctors will deliberately keep it under the influence of sedatives and under strict surveillance until they make sure that it remains "weighted".
The reactions did not wait long, including unrealized internet support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is overwhelmed titles
The fact that the media in their titles transcend reality is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that the titles are "selling" newspapers, but I also know that many of them are so-called "rechers", who do not read anything else.
And that's the fact that I've been suffering very much lately, the more heavier is the word of shave.
This is especially true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The titles "Israel attacked Gaza" are common.
Only in the text you can read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to the Gaza Strip burnt missiles, often during the announcement of the attack.
This will be the title "The two sides broke the landing."
Does the journalistic municipality realize that it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there) by this procedure?
Not even sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who survived Shoa.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where Dav shouted the passwords of the "Jewish pig" and similar trust, I stopped.
Does that want the world to complete what hasn't happened to Hitler?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews they were destined to eradicate the Salvia?
Ladies and gentlemen, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as "the guardian dogs of democracy".
So defend her.
As long as she's here.
And also defend the right of one truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to remain if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would be eliminated and the Czech Republic would be deleted from the map of the world?
Maybe you should also realize another fact.
In Israel, nearly 20% of the Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of Israel.
And they're good there.
When you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, for example, why they would do that?
In Israel they have work, social security and high health care (I have seen in my own eyes the highest private hospital of Hadassa, which is financed from sponsoring gifts of Jews from all over the world, usually go Arabs and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas also attacks his Arab brothers with his shootings.
The only true help of Gaza, and thus this uncalled region, is to get rid of Hamas and disarma him.
And do not condemn Israel to be indirectly in the titles.
Inform the practices of Hamas, the abuse of people as human shields.
Report that Hamas aims to eradicate the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the price of the death of innocent Arab children.
Report that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian assistance from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, which the Gazans do not pay for, and are even enraged that at this time the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels to allow suicide attackers to penetrate them in the territory of Israel, but for example in the construction of apartment houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would be significantly better.
Amazon buys for $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON has just confirmed Monday morning’s Information claim: an internet retailer – a video manufacturer and hundreds of other things – buys for $1.04 billion (970 million dollars) Twitch video streaming service.
The announcement caused a surprise not because no one would expect someone to buy Twitch, but because he expected a buyer to be YouTube.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitche Google for one billion was sure, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, had to become a widely used video streaming service - live version of YouTube.
Instead, it has quickly become a platform for players who have transmitted online games to it - the words Business Insider "YouTube for live play".
Interface Twitch.
YouTube is already popular videos "Let's play", a species where mudrlanti (mostly older) give the game processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube’s descriptionTwitche comes to a lot of tremor, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, no one too excited, was an example of how a company will pay for a possible competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube did not go out, although the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the CEO Twitche Emmeta Sheara’s statement: “We have chosen Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us achieve it faster.”
Another mystery is - sincerely - the incredible success of Twitche.
For snobs like me who claim that sports prefer to do rather than watch, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing on it, games instead of real play just watch.
One thing is watching a friend over his shoulder at three in the mornings, as Resident Evil plays, and the other thing is watching someone stranger gets 20 interventions in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you can just watch.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from the player’s perspective, so looking at their recording without being able to control the perspective itself is quite a good recipe how to get a bowl.
I admit that the games of speed run, in which Roger Bannisters will complete the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone is not a master of play or humor, his channel on Twitchi will probably not be too interesting.
But what about the skeptics like me?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth at the top of Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is mixed into Amazon Instant Video as elegant as it could have been YouTube.
But Twitch has something that every company wants to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitche Shear, Amazon and Twitch said, “Believing in the future of games” and media don’t seem to turn out, even as a spectator.
The second basic lie to creativism.
Another Czech translation of the U.S. atheistic candidate Aron Ra.
This time on the topic "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
Added to the original video.
The second basic lies to creativism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often ask us the question: “Who will you believe?”
The word of God or the word of man?
As if the human study was totally incomplete compared to the authority they imagined they had their doctrine.
Only when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to myths about God by humans written.
If there is an intelligent creator for some purpose, then it is the one who created a fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be the one who invented genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be the one who has added a series of evidence that only indicates the evolutionary conclusion to the final detail.
Why would all of these things otherwise exist?
Looks like he was trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people will tell stories, fabulous.
And they were the people who wrote all the texts that claim to be the word of God.
Each allegedly sacred doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "inspired" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictate of the angels, but those texts were written by no one except by mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, neither angels nor gods.
If there were really one true God, it would be an integral part of all gods of all religions, an over-galactic supergeny, the ultimate entity of the whole universe.
If the being of such size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, the only scripture of the Holy Spirit.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, as human authors couldn’t measure with such a work.
And people should not have to believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, undertaken by verified and truthful evidence, and reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire each reader to unity of common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't expect anything smaller.
Only what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of the one religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origin and all of them are constantly divided into increasingly separated denominations, seeking controversial truths, and each in some way claims to God’s leadership, regardless of continuing excitement and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Quran, the Bahá'u'lláh's Kitáb-i-Akdás, the Zarathustrov Avesty, the Sikh Adí-Granth, the Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Mormon, are all considered to be the only ones who belong to the "absolute truth" and the "s of truth."
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the way to a certain extent.
None of the above books have any advantages compared to other books.
None of them have evidence of resistance and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I don’t say that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and apology, because they contain irregularities, absurdities, and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are a proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable beasts instead of morality, and many of them claim that they have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - with the fact that each can also contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and therefore are subject to interpretation, impressions and views of their primitive and often the prejudice of politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books.
I wouldn't call it contradictions, rather, mutual comments.
We need to point out again that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
It is true that Genesis has more than one author and is certainly not a narrative of a clear witness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, that is, five Books of Moses, and Moses does not write any of them, because it was almost certainly not as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several interdependent oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were overfiltrated at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not even as old as her believers think.
Swifts from the Dead Sea are the oldest archaeological findings of texts known for their infinite foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are for many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese Nazi Egyptian.
Christianity began as the Gnostic Faith, followed by the Docetes and the Ebionics, and their entirely different views of Jesus, which eventually merged into some compromise called Orthodoxity.
Other Christian groups such as Luciferians were discredited and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these administrations is the King of Ugarit, who ruled 3500 years ago.
Since his followers represented a substantial threat to the young Mosque religion, the authors of the New Law decided to laugh, and Baal Zebul, "the Lord of the Mount," changed to "the Lord of the Mount" Belzebub.
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently changed for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what became New Law was canonized in the 4th century B.C. in a series of committee decisions at the House in Nicaragua.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply lifting their hand, as if the fact had to be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon developed depends on what was read about Sundays in those Christian centres.
What was read on the second Sunday after the Passover in Jerusalem’s church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
They gradually learned that they approached the same stories of the gospel.
Thus, the core of the canoe was developed from the fear of the original church.
So the Council simply accepted as the gospel any relevant stories that collapsed among the uninstructed mass at that time.
But they also took more than ten books from the Bible consciously, even though they refer to the books that were approved.
And it seems to us that we find letters both of the apostles and of the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only words of some people and/or are not even available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could this be approved if God was the true author of this random mixture of poems, similitudes, and psalms?
The Bible was surely written by people and certainly not too lighting, but instead!
That’s why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it’s almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We're talking about people who believed that rabbits and ass could speak, believed in the clays, bloody victims, ritual magic, charmed objects, fireworks, astrology, and five magic creatures.
They thought that when they used a magical prune that someone was sprinkled with blood, it would heal him from the leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought that the rabbits were overwhelming, and the netophiles are birds and the beerlings are fish and drink that it's the whole number.
These people believed that when they show pregnant cow-trained patterns, they will give birth to trained teeth.
How can someone who knows about genetics say this?
The authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, it would not contain such errors as it contains.
If it originated from the peel of truly superior beings and was thought of as a literal history, then it would not contain any of what it contains at all.
As a moral guide, it fails totally because, most of the original Hebrew scriptures were written by non-educated and bigotians who overlooked or promoted cruelty against animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slavery, abuse of nationality, abuse of family members, canni, abuse of race, abuse of race, abuse of childhood, abuse of race.
to defend their inhumanity by claiming to do the will of God.
However, creativists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creator had no favorite books, they would not have a god.
In their world, one and the other is the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “obedience to the creation rather than the Creator.”
But they themselves consider the word of man as the word of God and God himself, and even insist that their allegedly "sacred" books in some way distort God as such.
Not their version of God but all the versions of God.
Creacionist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, then God lies.
They cannot assume that God could exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the divinity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship the compilation made by man, as if these books were the same god, because they think they are the word of Jehovah.
Only God has never written or dictated any of the scriptures of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their alleged “inchanged word” of any god has been invented, composed, grouped, translated, edited, and often deliberately modified and overwhelmed by only missing people.

Apple iCloud allegedly submits hackers, publicly getting naked images of celebrity
Screenshots with deletion of unique files
Until then, an anonymous user on the server 4chan publishes naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the U.S. server Mashable.com warned.
It is alleged that it has gained unauthorized access to user accounts on Appl servers, where users with disabilities have been uploaded through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet expressed the problem.
Some of the celebrities refused images as fake, but some of the authenticities of the pictures already admitted.
They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for Katniss's title role in the Hunger Games series, or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in the Dead Beard 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the captured images and videos to enrich.
The recordings are allegedly expressed interest in American magazines, but hackers prefer money from the community, according to reports on the server 4chan.
According to The Next Web server, it is very likely to be a weakness in iCloud security.
In fact, GitHub appeared two days ago with a tool that enabled you to get passwords to your user accounts through hard power, i.e. automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool worked provenly, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had a lot of time to get access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
Therefore, iCloud users should change their Apple ID-related password for preventive reasons.
The key is the length of the password, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The shooting of naked images of celebrity to be considered a note of safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured multiple times better than computers in homes or smaller companies, uploads sensitive photos in unprotected form are an unnecessary risk.
If you want to backup explicit photos online or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only runs on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will have the opportunity to move sensitive images in time "to safe", and above all you will have a space to delete unpredictable images, so they will not unnecessaryly take the space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer HN and IHNED.cz readers in the form of electronic books from Michal Altair Valáška in PDF.
A smart way to save for a college script
Since the price for a high school script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the next second year student came with a smart way to reduce costs.
He invented a book lease system from senior colleagues with a nominal compensation offer to stop their return.
“A calculation book that usually costs $180, I earned a semester for ten and a chicken nugets,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
Lost 120.
According to the University Council, an average student loses more than $1,200 a year, but students have different options to manage these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online shops and creative solutions such as Schroederovo.
On the highest level there is a leasebook, which allows students to use a semester of the book, often with a significant discount, rather than buying it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 books on campus areas, says that book lease has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the sector shows that about a quarter of books in university libraries were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Vice-President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Stores in university libraries.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping Online
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the internet than in the university library.
The recommended price for the nineth edition of the book "Calculus" of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the internet it is possible to buy a new for $239.99 on Chegg.com, a retail shop specialized in the library.
Buy used
If you don’t care about other people’s notes or use and denial, the appropriate texts are used.
At Chegg.com, Calculus is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, a 25-year-old student at Brigham Young University, says he paid on Amazon.com for the used "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new sold for $48.
University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students with their teachers verify whether older publications are acceptable.
Sometimes changes to work in seminars are not significant.
If so, older editions can be sold for a break in price last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are also a popular alternative to buying used books on eBay Inc's Half.com.
Leasing
It is also worth lending books, if you treat them well, you don’t forget to return them, and you don’t need to have them even after the workshop is finished.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of the new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for the whole semestre for about $20.
Get acquainted with the terms of the trade in which you borrow the book, including damages for notes, emphasis or harm and damages.
Remember: If you do not return the book in time, the penalty may be higher than the price of a new book.
E-books
Another option is to take care of the e-book instead of the normal book.
Sometimes these books are basically leased in the form of electronic licenses valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the cheapest offers can be found by students of literary courses, as many classics are now available for free download, while natural and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon arrive at Pepperdine Law School, advises you to follow the ISBN as it guarantees you buy the right book.
Before ordering a book via the internet, make sure it’s really a warehouse, Gault advises.
He was convinced of it on his own skin.
The book you bought was sold for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university library.
Bahno, it's all.
And then they found a gun from the end of the war in the cave.
This valley stands a little bit from the church of St. Jiří.
We discovered a portion around, and we began to pull out the flying nanos - about a meter and a half bahn and shrunk leaves.
“When we approached the dinner, we hit the head,” said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it, and found that it was a torso attacking German gun used by SS units.
It is allegedly unusual to find.
According to my information, such guns were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand,” he added.
All wooden construction items have been distributed over time, so they are unusable.
Her body is preserved - she holds her shape.
How's it in the fountain?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS units, probably by fear not to be removed.
The fascists wouldn't do it.
They dropped guns in the forest," the founders said.
The gun was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Spirit Movement of Autumn found in the foam.
"We could have been there hand-granates, those once there were a lot around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully looked at the bahn so that there was no accident, but nothing else was near there," Novák said.
The discovery ends in the museum's warehouse at a castle in the nearby Slez Rudoltics.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet released the prisoner of the Czech
Exclusive interview Aktually.cz with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the imprisonment of pro-Russian separatists.
Kyiv/Praha - "I'm sorry, I have to take it... they call me from Donetsk," he apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktualmente.cz, Ukrainian general Volodymyr Ruban, or the director of the Center for the Liberation of War Prisoners.
General Lieutenant Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
It was not possible to hear the names of people, their numbers or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban specifies with his opponent at the other end of the phone.
"It'll be that - go there," he finished one of the blasphemous discussions with Doneck and once again devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a general in custody, a former pilot of the hunter and an active participant of anti-government protests in Maydan.
Yesterday, when we talked about it, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the imprisonment of pro-Russian separatists is devoted forty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: Maybe you know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counter-scientist estimates their number to thirty.
They can be much more, though.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have released captive Serbs, Dagestans, Czechs, one Swedish, Georgians... but the Czechs are not yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we hit your jailed country and could set him free.
Ukrainian soldiers occupied by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to occupy them?
They should understand that if the Czechs fight in Ukrainian volunteers and separatists take them, they will be shot without grace, as well as any other foreigner.
Separators consider these men to be a leasing soldier, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers occupy a group of Donetsk separatists - and, for example, the Czech Republic -, they will sit behind the nets and act with him as a war prisoner.
This guy is shortly surviving.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in war.
A.cz: How much have you been able to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that, then exchange.
Some sources say that it has been over hundreds of men a long time ago.
We have stopped counting how many people we helped.
But we just set them free... we couldn't save them from war if they decided to continue fighting.
The rescues are in war, doctors, surgeons, but we aren't.
That's right.
And every day they add another and another.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it must not always be about exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release prisoners, even human prayer.
A.cz: It is asked that in a few months you have gained great authority and even confidence in the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you achieve respect for both sides of war?
Heavy question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the overname "Crazy General with Steel Balls".
It doesn't hurt me.
Maybe that's the essence of our work.
As the boss of the Ukrainian Officer Assembly, I have already gained some authority.
I never lose, deceive, and always keep the word.
Whatever happens, I do honestly and speak the truth.
Even when it is the Ukrainian government, or the Done or Luganist very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm just telling them that they torture and kill them.
And that they're crimes.
Often I risk my life, even when I'm in prisoner exchanged... this work can mean end at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many sentences and tortures do you know?
... (long fault) ... to torture prisoners, even separatists are dismissed by Ukrainians in interrogations.
I'm sorry.
What about punishments?
They only play on the donor side.
I don't have any information about the Ukrainian army's execution of prisoners.
There are no signs that the Ukrainian army is doing something like that.
We have an idea of the number of sentences, but I can't specify the numbers and I don't even want to.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the Prorusse separatists.
They are officials, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They strive for independence and perhaps even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that is what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchys.
Separators already have oligarchs full of teeth and are their inexcusable opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them to the throat.
The same dreams and prosecutions, by the way, were revealed in Madagascar.
And now I'm a bit speculating: Russia supports separatists and the West supports Ukraine's state on the other hand.
I consider one speculation as big and the other as small.
This is my sentence, but there is an incredible contradiction within me.
A.cz: What do you think of one of the hardest leaders of the Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Whenever I cross the line of war fronts, I am without weapons and show soldiers or armed forces dismissed.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on a mushroom or in an optical focus.
Those faces of people who look at me, I see every time... and they can push their guns at any time.
He is an experiencing Colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He is considered a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, just like a small governor in the Great Russian Empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and Ukraine is considered some kind of misunderstanding.
Such a state should not exist, he said.
At the same time, he is an incomparable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we are talking about characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian television, you named your Prime Minister Arsenie Jaceňuka as a weak, tired and tired "leader" who would do the best if he would quickly leave.
For the three hundred meters walk, I always get scared at least five times.
So why should I hide with the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that it is harmful to our country?
A.cz: Do you think it is part of the war in Ukraine?
Maybe you know that the Ukrainians call Jacenuka "King".
And the chicken is not in the eyes of the Ukrainians a beast from which he would be afraid or should have respect and authority.
His behaviour directly copys the behaviour of the chicken.
Perhaps he is a good economist, but as the Prime Minister does not have the right to cry in the parliament, ask him to play with him his intrigues, threaten to put his role... he must manage the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister does not have the right to family, friends, rest on a widespread emotion.
He is the first of Ukraine’s ministers.
What about Jacenic?
Behaves like a puberty girl.
Yes, he's tired, but also weak, because he's never strong... he's not afraid of Ukraine, he's just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why Galactic Guards Can't Save Markets
Sylvester Stallone's three executives returned from the $30 million budget in the United States and Sin City: The woman I'd have to kill from the $70 million budget to just 12 million.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned only $14.6 million during the first weekend, as well as movies for children like How to train Dragon 2 were for a movie disappointment.
According to Robbie Collin's film criticism in Telegraph, what concerns children's films is their own quality.
Collin designated 2014 as “the worst” year of children’s films and How to train Dragon 2 was called “functional” continuation.
When it comes to a slightly older target group films, it seems that the problem must not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic servers with their average estimates of summer film premiers broadcast at least 2,000 films during the period between the Day of the victims of war and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of audiences and film critics indicate that this year’s film fruit is similar to last hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in access to viewers and greater popularity of internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Woods Book Processing, the Hollywood Reporter website said: "I think time is changing."
We have to admit it and not try to hunt for what was already.
Unlike the current Hollywood cash market crisis, Netflix gained $1.2 billion thanks to online services, which is almost twice as much as the last $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the study for relying too much on the rights of comics, and predicted Hollywood's "covering".
In the light of the current disappearance, some commentators declare that there may be something in his disastrous witchcraft.
With the listing of possible major cash markets in the summer of 2015 including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimons and the Jury world, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
Producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently marked a decline in markets as simply "cyclic." For Hollywood Reporter, he said: "The next summer will be the biggest cash markets in history and no one will worry about selling."
The DPRK again threatens Soul, fired another short flight missile
North Korea has fired into the sea another short flight missile, Soul said.
The alleged missile test was conducted shortly after the completion of joint military manipulations of the United States and South Korea, which Pchjongjang considers to be a preparation for the invasion.
Chagang province is located in the northwest of KDLR at the borders with China.
South Korean defense ministry spokeswoman said the shootings were fired from a location in the northwest of the Republic of Moldova and fled to a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea probably burned a missile from the province of Chagang for the first time, stated South Korean media appealing to the military circles.
In the province, there is a underground fire ramp for Scud-type missiles.
This is another series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has carried out an unusual amount of missile and firearm tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiffu
The protests of opponents of the NATO summit in Newport took place during the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to participate in the move against NATO.
And on Sunday about 150 people came to the Cardiff City Council for a meeting, which was described as the anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation during the weekend and spoke to protesters who traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be flying from Blue Mountains
TWO youth tourists were taken by plane and transferred to safety after spending the night at Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and eighteen-year-old man went on a trip to Govetts Leap in Blackheathu after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn’t return home, their relatives called the police around 8:00 a.m.
She was sent by search papers including local police and rescue teams, and a couple were found around 11 hours in the evening near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl kneeled down, and the man fell down, and at the same time fell into his head.
Police stayed with them overnight, and on Monday morning they were taken away.
In a stabilized state, sanitation was transferred to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought out of Opavy only a point, he won on his legs
The 23-year-old forvard could decide, but failed at two greatest chances.
After the goal, she mostly shot nearly three minutes before the end, but in the network she ended at the gateway of Opavy Joseph Květoň.
I had it on my feet, I have to give such chances.
"I'm angry with myself," his grandmother shook his head.
"If I had to put it up under the wire, I was a little sad," he said.
The Sigmy defender did not allow Opa much, except for Mikul's 11th minute arrival, but he covered the Reichl's goal.
Then they began to press the Hananites, but in the block of defence, they did not run away and shots from far away in May.
Fifteen minutes of comparison, then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But your grandfather did not give up the chance, and so it ended at 0:0," the coach of Hanaki, Leoše Kalvodu, said.
It also took the point because of the absences in the assembly, where, besides the two wounded, Petr Vavřík and the triangle shooter Petr Ševčík, hosted in Slezka from Sigmy, were missing.
In contrast to their previous policies, they did not allow them to go.
The substitutes deserve an absolutorium.
Sigma was playing football, but we haven't left it for anything at one standard," said Slezans coach Peter Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combat.
Remize is probably deserved, a point is worthy of profit for us," he added.
Sigma got the remiso at four points, which means the 13th place.
Nothing could satisfy the club's head Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znojem, conditioned his million deposit in the cash deposit with a diameter-different performance in other matches.
"We noticed the warning of Mr. Lébra, so it can't be said that boys wouldn't want to fight," Calvoda noted, and on the address of your grandmother's sleeping shooter he added: "I believe it's coming, and when he gets a goal, it's gonna start to fall there.
"But after the first time, I'll replace him right away to save his goals for further matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino was inspired by Venice twice.
The film festival is different from the crisis
After a huge enthusiasm for the launch of Birdman film, whose director Alejandro González Ignaritu was ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, another days showed the impression that the interest in the 71th anniversary of the festival in Venice has fallen somewhat.
Whether it’s because the number of places in the largest room has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman’s criticism followed, but for viewers less attractive images as a documentary about genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s Watching the silence and other films with a social theme from the U.S. homes to the Iranian story.
Cocktails from comics
Even the red shirt in front of the festival palace had not yet dressed like the past, and it was allegedly a problem to find a place in the hotel in the last minute.
The crisis is spoken more than elsewhere in Italy and it is not surprising that it has affected even so-weighted institutions like the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not a lack of personalities, but present only in relation to films.
While younger fans sought the autograms of the actors of comic superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully deteriorated dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations it became the main event of the legendary actor Ala Pacin.
He was in two movies right now.
In the story of the show, which is listed outside the competition, recorded by Oscar Barry Levison according to the novel Philip Roth, Pacino, fourteen-year-old, has a role that is close to him: an actress at the top of fame, suffering from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him on the second day as a stranger owner of ironing from the rural town of Manglehorn film, recorded by David Gordon Green, was an unforgettable experience.
The wolf cup for the best actress performance shouldn't pass it - but does the artist still need awards in the Pacinova format?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the public, and especially the Italian, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his ancestors came from.
Body for Italy
This year’s Italian film is very good in Venice.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first image of Birdman awarded a long pocket.
The calibration of the mafia is reflected in the family relationships between the clans that fight each other for power and money, and the director has been able to match all the assumptions for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and actress.
He was also engaged in a chamber psychothriller Hunger Heart, who recorded Saverio Costanzo with Albu Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost lost her own child with his sincere anxiety.
On the contrary, from French competition films, neither the Redeemer for Fame nor the Three Hearts, both of which are fascinating on the traditional model of consumer films based on the popularity of actors.
But finally, two really amazing movies, Birdman and the Black Soul, are not so few in the first half of the festival.
And although the festival pictures have some depressive topics, the new Peter Bogdanoviche photo called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy featured in Venice outside the competition and recorded in the style of American celebrities in the 1940s, managed to raise the mood for more than one day.
Police arrested four manufacturers of pervitine in Prague, carriage drugs from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men 42, 42 and 37 years old and a fifty-year-old woman who manufactured and sold pervitin drugs in Prague from last November to August this year," police spokeswoman Johan Rössler said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, the intervention unit in Cihljarska Street captured a twenty-four-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who figured in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a seller of donations.
The following day, the detectives were detained on the basis of the prior consent of another member of the group, a thirty-seven-year-old man.
The last four police officers hit on Wednesday morning, August 20, in the Malesian Burns Area," the spokesman said.
Women from Poland receive a third of drugs for drug transportation
The main organizer had a wide field of application.
In the aerospace department, in the garden house in Horoměřics, in the apartment in Koňovov street and other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, provided various tools and chemicals needed to produce it and provided the transport of drugs with pseudo-efedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighted the manufactured drug, distributed into plastic bags and subsequently sold pervitin.
With the transfer of drugs from Poland or the sale of drugs, a fifty-five-year-old woman has helped him.
For this she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drugs made,” Rössler added.
The criminals also conducted a number of domestic inspections on the basis of the judge's order, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital weights, pay bags, injection syringes, bulbs and other aids and objects that may be considered as a complete equipment for the production of metamphetamine.
The dealer has been sentenced seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, police found that the main organizer has been sentenced to court seven times since 1995 for property crime, and the woman has not been sentenced to court," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detained in 2006 was conditionally convicted of sexual abuse and a seventy-year-old automotive engineer who was detained for freedom was nine times sentenced to court since 2009.
This was also mainly due to property crime.
The investigator accused three men and women of committing unlawful production and other handling of narrow and psychotropic substances and poisons, threatening them for up to a decade of imprisonment.
For three persons, the investigator finally submitted an incentive to the State Prosecutor for a proposal for a link to which the judge finally placed it," the spokesman said.
The fourth accused, a thirty-year-old recidivist, ended in freedom.
His position and role in this case was not as important as the other accused.
Police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers wood and carbon shakes.
Ferrari offers very interesting things within its other products for a lot of "interesting" prices.
As a good example, in Italy, handmade shakes with a 42 x 42 cm toy plate.
If you like it, prepare more than $40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer gets a set of black and red-lacked figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fibers.
Nobody will be surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a riding horse figure available.
If you don’t have chess as a sufficiently valuable gift, the Ferrari 500 F2 (perhaps manually) model is also available at 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
The disruption of gyms and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that gymnastics have good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
In the last fourteen days, there have been great preparations in schools.
It is mostly about routine matters, such as transferring flowers from summer storage back to classes and shaking wings.
There will be a little bigger framol at the gym.
A couple of days before the start of the season, the furniture, computers and other technical equipment and library are shipped into the library.
There has been no thieves or prosecution, and four-year gym in Hořics opens and rebuilds its activity after three years.
Not on a public, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incapable.
They had to wait for the existence of a school to be confirmed by entering the register of schools managed by the MŠMT.
“French socialists should collapse and put France in order,” key allies Francoise Hollanda said.
Valls calls for a strongly disintegrated left-wing to “demonstrate its support” to a combating socialist president whose new division of functions did not meet with the consent of the majority of the French.
The President deserves general respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay on his side," he said.
As a peaceful gesture, the President of the Government insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour work week despite the passionate interviews by Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who proposed the rules to be released at the beginning of the week.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to remain “coherent” with the government.
Christiane Taubir, Minister of Justice, made a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist deputies, where she criticized the Socialist Party for “the French people lost faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, a leader of the extremely conservative right, laughed with the ongoing internal disputes among the socialists, declaring that he did not assume that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls was also forced to establish a new government when the previous one did not endure until the end of the summer.
"And the new will not last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen said to his fans.
She reiterated the challenge of her party to dismiss Parliament and said she was convinced that it could win early elections and is ready to rule the country.
The French government suffered in the March municipal elections of defeat and the extremely conservative right has succeeded in the European Parliament elections in May.
According to a weekly survey in Journal du Dimanche, 76% of French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of being divided into several competing fractions before the end of Holland’s term of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French will soon be patient unless the new socialist government can improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but the public opinion must think that changes are happening in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Hazard and street art no longer limits Prague to elections
The amendments to the relevant statements should be prepared and approved until the new leadership of the capital.
From the streets of Prague there will be no other play in front of municipal elections and the city will not limit street art.
There will be no limitation for dogs.
Prague will not reach the October election to prepare and approve in the representation of the changes to the relevant statements.
"In addition, the change decision should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends the mandate in a few weeks," said Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
The cancellation of flat gambling in your territory has been decided by several municipalities in recent weeks, such as Prague 5 and 7.
Herny will not disappear, but the gambling statement will not change yet.
This is the task of a new city leader after elections.
We wouldn’t even technically do this now, given, for example, the deadlines for remarks and the like,” explained Manhart.
He added that the last negotiations of the current representation, which must approve the amendment of the statement, will take place on 11 September.
The referendum on a flat gambling ban will be held in the municipal elections of Prague 1 and Prague 8.
For example, the ban on gambling is currently valid in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
The expenditure will not change for the same reasons even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
In particular, Prague 1 complains about it, which has already sent the magistrate a proposal of places to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angela.
The application that regulates the hunting of dogs in the city will take several months, yet it is not completed.
The location of the players and the problem of busking addresses urban statements.
They can only be issued or edited by the representativeship of the capital.
The councillors have only an advisory vote, and they should not make statements themselves.
Last week he set a victory to Scottish independence advocates on reach of hand
The Scottish independence campaign was at risk that this error would be triggered when she barely put on billboards throughout Scotland asking whether the Scots would want to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by calling on their wallet, and you won’t get their respect when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Law is still alive in Scotland, although only few Scots are still going to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to expel exchangers from the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond knows this well, and therefore repeatedly questioned his opponent, Unionist Darling, in the television debate whether he is willing to respect the "suveronic will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters vote for independence, and begin to support the single currency for Scotland and England.
Darling forced him to vote between Scotland’s civil society and London’s finances, and with grimashe he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of Scottish voters.
However, the debate on what Scotland will have had has already been less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and defense of state health that citizens have for free.
Darling in the case of currency supported London’s bankers and also created an impression that he would not protest against the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond said, "He went to bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous situation for all Scottish politicians.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the Association of "boss" to the British Industry Confederation.
It begins to be clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with the Scottish Prime Minister Salmondem was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a fucking absent home.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron has at least been able to say that Scotland could be a "succeed independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it almost hurts him physically.

The Pessimistic Beginning of School by Miloše Urbana
An illustration to the story Longest year
Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end of the holiday was the best at all, the last week that wasn't going anywhere and we just bowed down with grandmother in the summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it was possible to get from Tuzex, shoes from eastern Germany.
Reading the Quick Shields, already defeated, screwing on the mountains around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis curtains, was no longer hard, the sun cooled back and shoulders, climbed the rays to a separate.
Evening slight nervousness, still a holiday regimen, sleeping up to half the eleventh, a week will be worse, a moment before sleeping they take from a few minutes to two hours, and then waking up in the morning at half the seventh.
It's coming Monday.
Mostly, it's not easy, on the contrary, the summer is misleading in front of school.
Enjoy a plaque in a monstrous light and look like a plastic tray in a glass craft, there is the school, ZDŠ A.
Zapatotic with blurred pink shirt, and old known faces before it even a couple of new, boys heightener, girls chest heightener.
These are dirty, avoiding them, and it's interesting how they're inseparable and how they're here soon.
And these adult girls who seem to come screaming, now laughing hysterically, maybe something has changed in their life through the holidays, while everything is in my old age.
And again, the new priests, some nervous and others silent, why do they get here at all?
Because he has to, educational war is mandatory.
So inside, cold floor moisture and lightweight disinfection, poisoned schoolgirl with a mope, is the same as he says that he borrows the keys from the shelf cabinet, where the libraries can be left and which are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the shell remains in memory, it is not now, it is well ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
Just from this idea, the stomach is shining and headache begins.
The head, which is even worse than the lesson from mathematics, that devil game for the chosen, of which I do not belong and I will never be.
Again, those three and four, not gods five, hide from trial, fall into the lavish and best to sublimize, be there, not even be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and so far dream stories about the lovely girls and beautiful buildings of no one, of the Antiochs, and of no one else in the universe.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, just like years ago.
The native daughters were allowed to die.
She is at risk of an exceptional punishment - Newsy.com
The first birth occurred in March 2012 at the public toilet cabinet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without foreign aid, she was born a girl who, after she had crushed the puppy in the ready deck, hid under the bowl and brought it to the road attractor, where she placed it in the wheels of a dozen meters away from the road.
Born on the way to school
I guess it came to me a little earlier.
I was on my way to school.
In the bus I had to go to the bathroom, I was born there.
She was born alive, looked at me.
I cut the puppy sneaker with the knives I weared to school,” the accused described and said she was ashamed of pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the place, put the child's body into the pocket and took it away, took it out of the pocket, wrapped it into a black ice cream and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havlíčka Broda," the new complaint says, not quite obvious when the death occurred.
It could be a dozen minutes, but also a few hours after birth, when covering the deck, or when inserted under a belt, undercooling or bleeding from a non-contained puppy.
This scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman in a nearly unidentified period from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by accidental witnesses under a knife at a fisherman in Havlíčkobrodska, she was born herself again secretly.
This time in the undercover apartment bathroom in the family house.
Without checking if she was born alive, she stopped and tied the puppy that was surrounded by her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packaging including icelit bags and left him in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the fisherman.
Finally, a friend struck her.
The father of both children was just an accused friend, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
Even for this reason, he is not now standing before the court, only being punished for sin against the Law of funeral.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like being punished as a comrade.
He manipulated the child against my desire.
I know my solution wasn’t correct, but it came to me at that moment as a human,” the accused, who allegedly was subjected to a man’s relationship and feared him.
During her speech, a young woman spoke fairly balanced.
Tears turned into her eyes until the moment she talked about the relationship with her parents, from which she left herself after reaching the age of age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They're following me every 14 days to visit, they're doing everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she said.
I didn't give my equipment because I didn't want kids, I looked young.
Furt wanted to put it in the babybox, but I don't know what happened to me.
“I can’t explain that,” the judge answered.
She refused to act with the mind and intention of killing a newborn.
According to her, the second child was born dead.
Even in pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I restricted it.
And he didn't drink hard.
I smoke too," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen on her in both cases, she allegedly claimed that she had health problems and that she was injured.
And that's my friend.
The main trial will continue in the court's statements of court experts on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, the judgment could be issued.
The woman is threatened by a penalty rate of up to 18 years of prison, if possible with an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise closes to Prestige Cruise’s three billion purchases
According to sources known to the whole issue, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third-largest travel vessel operator in the world, advanced in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion.
The Norwegian Cruise trade, a $6.8 billion market-valued company that competes with greater competition for Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), enabled access to the luxury Cruises and rich customers.
The deal can be published this week already, the source said on Sunday, but he noted that the negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent share in Norwegian Cruise.
Resources did not want to be nominated because the negotiations are not public.
Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to comment requests, spokesman Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise is headquartered in Miami and operates thirteen tripling vessels in North America, the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight tripling vessels flying to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced the sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the ninety-nine billion tournament segment will benefit from the rise of middle-class in growth economies such as China and India next year.
Companies are competing in order to become a preferred option for these customers when choosing trips.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer at U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since its close of a sale of $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it has been combined with the tour operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of free-time and casino companies controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise introduced stock stocks in January 2013.
According to the registration by the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting had a 28 % share of capital, Apollo 20% and private investment company TPG Capital LP 8 %.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offer includes Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises in total 82% of the volume of North American passengers.
Pro-Democratic activists in Hong Kong on the day after the decision to vote provoke Chinese authorities
There was a group of loyal to Beijing who had a Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates will participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first receive support from the appointment committee, which will likely be composed of loyal members of Beijing.
Due to this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to reach election tickets and force pro-democratic activists to restore the promise and to strengthen the financial center of Hong Kong’s protests against the “Central Occupation” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main cause of tension, Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report establishing Chinese official powers in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists organized an informal referendum on elections in a special official district, and hundreds of thousands of people entered and occupied the city’s commercial district.
The press conference, which will be held by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese contact office in Hong Kong.
During several press conferences, the Vice-President of the Permanent Committee of the Legislative Committee Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of the Office of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also discussed.
Student activists said they would meet in the afternoon before the Hong Kong government office.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations on "state sovereignty" with Eastern Ukraine
According to Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of displaced areas.
His spokesman Dmitri Peskov later explained that Putin did not intend to point out that the regions of eastern Ukraine under the control of separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reviewed in order to gain power in the Russian speaking area to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s challenge to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals, corresponds to a clear strategy governing the outbreak of anxiety five months ago: Aid separatists to possess the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give a place to the newly declared Russian rebels, to connect New Russia with independent facts.
In an interview for the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military action to recapture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were dominated by separatists in March and April after Moscow acceded to the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists of the recently occupied territory were labeled "New Russia" or "New Russia", a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
The Russian press agency Itar-Tass has announced Putin’s words that “the prison of illusion” is everyone who believes there are peace negotiations on the horizon because Ukrainian politicians have launched a campaign before parliamentary elections on October 26, while government units attack civilian populations in the regions of government separation.
“In the interests of people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only about legal matters but also about the political organization of society and the status of the state sovereignty of Southeast Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin's invasion of state sovereignty was thought to be in a context of broader autonomy, which has been dealing with Kyiv's leadership for several months, which is to relieve the concerns of Russian language areas of threatening cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that the necessary autonomy could only be granted to the eastern region by the Ukrainian government.
It is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman, which had to correct Putin's "wrong interpretation", emphasized the approach of Russia's leadership to resolve the uprising of separatists in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million populations of origin rang to the ethnic Russians.
Moscow should have a much greater difficulty to accede to Doneck and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian and public opinion surveys that have taken place before the conflict have shown wide support for Ukraine’s settlement.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats have negotiated on international forums, would allow regional governments in Ukraine to determine their own business agreements and international relations, and thus, essentially, to give the Kremlin real control over the territory that would combine the Russian fort with the Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, anchored five months ago, is the headquarters of the main Russian naval fleet, marine commercial background and historical coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also down centers, factories and slivarians, which produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Porošenko proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after new elections - consider the changes in the Constitution that would give more control over their finances and language status to various regions.
However, this vision of autonomy differs significantly from the vision of Kremlin and separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and promoting violence.
Putin’s last challenge to treat the separatists as equally following the next rebel proceedings last week after Russian units and tanks from the formerly calm region along the Azov Sea have penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separate Russian reinforced forces have taken control of Novoazovsk with such a force that the Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that it is a trap in order to occupy strategic coastal territory to Crimea.
This has accelerated a massive civil and military effort to strengthen Mariupol, a port with 500,000 metallurgical combinations of inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsulas.
Poroshenko on Saturday attended a meeting of the European Union's chief representatives in Brussels and urged to take action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent in the last 23 years.
“We are approaching the point from which there is no return,” Porošenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit has not undermined any definitive steps - the leaders are urging the adoption of further sanctions against Russia in the event of closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said on Saturday to reporters in Kyiv that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaya after last week two colonies of Russian reversed vehicles and 1,000 military units drove into the Dona region.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers arrested in Ivoryland during the Russian invasion were exchanged for 10 Russian planters arrested a week ago in Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in the scandal with uncovered photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disturbance over hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his bride Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is shocked after getting on the internet in the biggest scandal with hacknut photographs of celebrities, the series of explicit photographs naked by Jennifer Lawrenc.
Hacker claims that he has sixty photographs with the naked star Hunger Games Lawrenc and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, Rihanny singers, Ariany Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Due to iCloud escape, Australian actress Teresy Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourn actress Greece have also received personal pictures to the public.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greek for hand last month, said to the magazine Confidential, "It's unpleasant."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
The Greek who is now in New York, according to online newspapers, has said hacking is "unshaken" and those who have become his adjective are "like humiliation".
It is believed that the hacker has received thirty Palmer photos with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which he goes upstairs without breaking up at the pool.
For example, Palmer acted in the film Love and Honor, where she was her counterpart Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the TV series Chuck Strahovski and thriller actress Sucker Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen images.
Lawrenc TMZ said, “It is a clear violation of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen criticized on Twitter: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is the same as selling stolen goods.”
From the legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigmy footballers have improved the Lebra, even without winning
Olomouc - The chromas and glows that the co-owner of the olomouc Sigmy Josef Lébr strengthened on his subjects last week are, seems, the past.
Being from Opavy finally brought only a point behind the fireless remit.
The club's boss was just a little good enough for the boss's fighting and fighting.
Money for expenses could come to the club soon.
"I'll take another match as I talked about it last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lebr confirmed that despite not winning Sigma, the players convinced her to improve performance.
The battle and bets we played mainly in the second half of the time were exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I am able to forgive that it is not winning.
If we were playing so since the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we haven't lost yet," he said.
Sigma in Opava stopped the input pressure of the home, then matched the game, and in the second half it was better.
After Kalvod’s victory, the believers sacked, but they didn’t reach their goal, so they couldn’t win.
However, the result is not according to our ideas.
We were missing to be fully satisfied, but only one change of chances," Lebr, who does not think that the change in the approach of footballers has only caused his threat.
There were certainly several aspects there.
Whether from my side, from the coach or from the fans,” Lebr said.
With pressure, Sigma has to count.
The players were not very interested in commenting after the game in the last week's event.
I'm trying to get these things out of here.
“I tried not to let it go,” the young broker Michal Reichl said.
He left the question of the last week’s statement by Vaclav Vasiček, who did not give the greatest opportunity to Sigmy in the Saturday match.
But afterwards, he only disclosed a bit of pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everyone wants to get us out.
"Today we showed that if we fight and drive all the fuck, that's going to happen," he said.
The warning took to the heart
Even Leoš Kalvoda did not hesitate that the preparation for the match was not the easiest due to the atmosphere that ruled in Olomouca last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized this, and today it was seen that Mr. Lébra's warning took into mind.
Even though it wasn’t about fighting and shattering it before,” the coach said.
It was similar to the first fifteen minutes today.
It took to compare the hardness and realized what the second league was.
That's not just about football, but especially about that fight," Kalvoda said.
It remains to be hoped that Sigma will work in the next matches from the beginning.
"I would like to believe that," he added.
