"North Korea says, 'hinding-hindi' unilateral to disrupt army without faith
North Korean Foreign Minister of the United Nations said on Saturday they would be devastated by the United States because of continual sanctions and prevent-hindi unilateral that the nation would explode their nuclear military under this situation.
Ri Yong Ho in the Annual General Assembly of Representatives of Worldwide said North Korea would make a "important step with good lion good" in the past few years, such as a testing nuclear and missile test, testing nuclear site testing, and demanding not to do nuclear military and technology.

"As inconfidence in America, there will be no contradiction with our national security and under this situation, we are not really unilateral to defend our arms."
While Ri examinated the familiar Korean complaint about the invasion of Washington in a "jugto-jugto" diskarte in denuclearization where North Korea excuse while doing this small step, his speech became important because he didn't immediately refresh the unilateral denuclearization of the nuclearization.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump denominated a declaration of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between President of the United States and President of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim urged him to attempt towards "denuclearization of Korean Peninsula" while Trump urged Trump to guarantee North Korea's salvation.
North Korea long searched for formal finishing in 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States said Pyongyang should initially explode their nuclear armada.
Washington has also encodered the desired areas of severe international sanctions in North Korea.
"United States rushed to denuclearize" and suspended sanctions in order to implemente their intentions delicately, and they also opposed "deklaration at the end of the battle," Ri.
"La visión de las sanctions, la visión de las sanctions, es una ruptura de las personas, las cuales no nos conocen.
"But problematically, it's a constant sanction that we're going to find out."
No plans have been mentioned by Ri for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which he declared by United Nations head of United Nations in the first week.
En cambio, minister declare la triple predication between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If South Korea and not the United States party in this issue of devastation of nuclear weapons, it will not take a deadlock the denuclearization of Korean peninsula denuclearization."
Despite this, Ri's tone of information was completely different from the previous year, when he said to the UN General Assembly that it would not limitate targeting the territory of the United States of North Korea rockets after calling "Mr Evil President" Trump Kim a "raket man" in suicidal mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who guarded "devastatingly devastating" North Korea in the previous year, awarded honour to Kim for his default plan de acciones devastating, but he said that much more needs to do, and must continue sanctions until North Korea denuclearize.
Trump said on Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time for him, and he said, "If that duration was two years, three years, three months, three months, case case."

Originally, he also missed the traveler and internationally mysterious man keeping Atkinson in the splendid now in a few ads on Barclaycard TV, where he snuckled his motherfucker.
JE's last line is one or two fine exen.
I liked Johnny English approaching to helicopter whilst helicopter medieval butterfly and hitting rotor blades in his helmet.
I see Atkinson's talent in the physical performance, but wasn't effective and wasn't naturalized the excessive performance, especially because there's a reason to add the performance as its element to the brands of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible.

The premise, now long experienced on the site, is the position of Great Britain in difficult situations.
A cyber-hacker has deployed a vaste conflictive web network of British spies, which sets out the differences of all British agents in the field, which sets out disillusionment of agents who deployed - a miserable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last thing to destroy the prime minister of a superior and helpful person, who experienced a total delicate sensation of the lack of human support in politics to him: Emma Thompson conclude la performance in a mala-Teresa-May this character but not much descriptive from script.

Johnny English himself, who works now as professor in a exclusive institution, but gives private learners how to become a undercover operational operational: this is happening, because it gives English a mala School of Rock academia.
English was immediately called to Whitehall for a emergency newsing and joined her back the former sidekick for a long time, Bough, who was repeated by Ben Miller.
Now Married Bough, who is married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks paper where Vicki Pepperdine is relatively naked.
Batman and Robin are returning to the action that they love peace partners at Secret Service of His Fame, and they can confess the beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova, which Olga Bulletova guarded.
Adequatement, premier premier delicatement descended de l'affliction of charismatical technology billionaire who said that he would break down the computers of Britain: a miserable Jason Volta, Jason Volta, de Jake Lacy.
English and Bough started in a long relationship with them in a long relationship with the privileges of receiving: offering waiters, they started fire in a nice French restaurant; making them a scene to navigate without ignoring Volta's magnitude yate; and a long-range family aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged aged.
Nothing is perfect all the best in the last sequence of that, but even if it is soaked and soaked, there's a chance of being off TV's off his life.
Nei, it's not great things.
And I'm not allowed to think about other Johnny English film: Isn't British film industry giving Rowan Atkinson a role that can give justice to his talent?

Rather than being in the middle of action, as often occurred in him for the United States, a five major winners scored five times his time between becoming cheerleader and testing in range, inviting any miserable to him.
Because he never became the best direct driver even in the fall of his career, the 48-year-old wasn't given for the inclusive Le Golf National course, where often problem mal shots in long rough.
And for not enough the hard race, Mickelson fronted, in the 9th match Sunday, in the championship of British Open Francesco Molinari, who compares aged Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of them against this game.
If Americans, who scored four points initially in 12 singles matches, start hot, may be important against Mickelson.

New Warship of Germany
Germany's latest frigate in 2014 should be noted that the German frigate was solded by ancient warships since the Cold War period, but it is still not happening until next year due to system defects and increased cost, local media report.
"Rheinland-Pfalz", ladyship of new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, was suspended until the first half of the year 2019, according to Die Zeit tour, which was mentioned in a statement by a military spokesman.
I must be with Navy in 2014 the boat, but problem the big project due to serious issues issues after finishing shipping.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class boats ordered by Navy in 2007 will be solded to other Bremen-class frigates.

Among other important features is the longer period of review - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
Nonetheless, continuum responsiveness significa que latest warships - affirmed to give fortunes in Germany to show power in different countries - will be ready to come time when these come to service, says Die Zeit.
