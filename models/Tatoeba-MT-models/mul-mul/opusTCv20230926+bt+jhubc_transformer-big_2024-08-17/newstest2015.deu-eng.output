Karratha Police arrested 20-year-old after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was captured after the driver had driven it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it left a gasoline station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
Police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on the Burgess Road before he drove to the Buschland, where the officials lost it from the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha’s police accuse a 20-year-old man of non-observing a stop signal as well as unprecedented driving.
He is expected to appear in Karratha on September 23 before the Office Court.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.

George Webster, 28, was prosecuted in a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, sleeping, and could not signal any consent."
Webster is also alleged to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae introduced the negotiation date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reflection on the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress deputy Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil rights.
"As trade unions die, middle-class jobs die," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and Deputy President of the Progressive Caucus at Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to propose the law on the authorisation of employees, along with Citizenship Act John Lewis.
This breaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination – and thus stops anti-union forces.
The supplementation of the National Labour Law to create an opportunity for workers subject to discrimination to organize a trade unions representation to appeal to a civil court for justice - and for compensation or penalty - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors suggest their bill is to get back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlashes that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country -, Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press, and association law in a way of breathing.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would replace democracy.
In full consciousness that the workers and their trade unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that expressly recognized that "the rights of the workers are guaranteed to association and joint negotiations and actions."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism would replace Adolf Hitler with a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause expressly saying: “The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or business.
Agreements that restrict or target this right to distort it are zero and denial; measures targeting it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everybody has the right to join trade unions in their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic prizes that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advises other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to establish a trade unions - and that this trade unions should then participate in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government agencies - should be protected.
Following these rights in the United States, it is actually very wise to take the American ideal back to the eyes, so the working population must have the right to unite and share hearing in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for the industry and has raised the entire nation to an inconceivable level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - has long been overwhelmed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and renounced the promise of democracy.
Judge suspends temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, saying it would likely have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was taken into force by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June, and to enter into force on September 1, would force doctors carrying out abortions to acquire a patient reception at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to achieve these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing to the judge will be appointed to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors would spend more time to obtain hospital recruitment rights.
“Today’s decision means that women in Louisiana will escape a delaying law that will take them their health and their rights,” Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to keep the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the complaint and also applied for invocation rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, while courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi non-constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which most of the clinics remaining in the state had been forced to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instruction rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents oppose that measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only a doctor who conducts abortions in Louisiana has patients who are invisible, the Center for Reproductive Rights reported.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to no longer carry out abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out the surgery from fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not be punished by doctors for the conduct of abortions, while their requests for patients were still dependent.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of death by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video honor for her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of death with ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1100 Australian women who found ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent five years after the diagnosis were still alive.
Susan Jordan, research director of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Small Study: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing diseases, as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer has already advanced further at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services in order to counteract distances somewhat, she proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of involuntary doctors to give specialists the opportunity to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study found a poor long-term survival rate in women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old young mother from the Golden Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret the declining numbers of house owners
The decline along with an increased decline in the number of household owners under the age of 35 could lead to the loss of tens of thousands of pounds a year when today’s young consumers after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reaching the “Greenboard Group for Garden Products”.
The report states that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with their own home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular practice of stopping asphalt facilities for parking purposes and the declining garden size are further factors that the industry threatens, in which estimated £5 billion are implemented annually.
In London, where the share of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is indicated.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can’t pull plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden advisor for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular among renters, for example, because they can bring their plants to a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to increasing numbers of household owners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition politician Imran Khan and spiritual Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state TV TV PTV.
Minister of Information, Pervaiz Rashid, said soldiers could have pulled the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The transmitter introduced his operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends back.
At the same time, about 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a kilometre away, they supplied collisions with security forces equipped with stacks and stones.
The police used tears.
The demonstrators asked Sharif's resignation, but this rejected it.
The country's army is forced to make a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using without violence."
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday night, the military reported: “The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state.”
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan suggests that Prime Minister Sharif has been fraudulent in parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated on weekends after Khan and Qadri had urged their followers to go to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s oldest U.S. diplomats to inform a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Mirror and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major activity area for the U.S. and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that Germany's main secret service had Ankara in visibility also provided significantly worse reactions by the Turkish government.
Warning: Local guides threatened with consequences for Pendler
The federal warning strike of the Lok Guide on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The stand announced for 18 to 21 p.m. applies to all transport companies, including the distance, regional and S-rail traffic,
The main direction of the warning strike is goods transport.

The German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There is no regional focus.
The main direction of the warning strike is goods transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where they want to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences in concrete terms.
Police Chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence on Friday to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca for oppression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The Chief of the Police of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested in the famous Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf, according to corruption orders by businessmen and barber owners.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of oppression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià on Friday to the Office of the State Attorney for Corruption.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with the corruption proceedings and were interrogated together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the agitated nightclub owners stated that the veteran industry of the authorities had serious effects on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Leave our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international tags this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing a 18-year-old British tourist who performed Fellatio on 24 men during a tour.
The island authorities have since attempted to stop the wrong behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the famous alcoholic beverages surroundings.
The Playhouse Club, where the fallacy accident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organisator Carnage together had to pay a fine of €55,000 (73,000).
The tourist place Magaluf, mostly popular among young British holidaymakers, is also known for some accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and storm weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with severe shame and strong winds affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21:00, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen to Sunday at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of brief, storm-sturding screws, including a guss that began just 20 hours ago and provided nearly 4mm precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8°C.
The bad weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19:30, but was hit by a wind wind — a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance — and had to restart.
Wind blows at this time reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The flight delay led to the delay of some other flights, including a Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible shame.
Matthies says: the highest time for the great network
Given the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech noise centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts us with a highly familiar electronic accessory.
While I write this here, my look on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable would not be, all listeners would fly around the house in the shortest time, and that would be even more retro.
What does it mean for the Ecletronic (ecletronic)?
No, tip error: electronic) Sector the rule that the world's newness of today is the electric screw of tomorrow is purchased - old.
For example, whoever still has a pipeline television in the living room, says only that he basically refuses television.
Why these considerations?
Because IFA’s enthusiasm at the function tower this week brings us back to our absolute inkompetence in electronics issues.
The laye, who had previously been blindly controlled the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being spread with an incredibly irritable expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, it's all right?
What should we talk to people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such a quark?
In fact, for about 20 years, it's mainly because we've got to connect our house.
In order for the yogurt to be self-employed, the fire reporter will tell us to the Maledives on vacation that it burns a degree in the workroom.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office from the air conditioning to our baltic arrival ...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: we will lift our arm clock, you say, "Saugen!" - and the dust sausage robot runs at home.
I'm crazy.
Everything runs less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods disappear," a industry knows, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamguard sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but nothing is useful because we are in the dust.
From everyday practice, we also know that when a new fashion device is really urgently used, the battery is guaranteed empty.
Another reason is that the spirale cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection spaces, while missile and murder seizures on their communities were underway during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools were closed in Gaza while the area was recovered from the fighting.
The school start brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fight are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, encountered by a missile, were removed before the students met granate plates from the walls and screw walls.
"We're a bit scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident at Kibbutz Saad and a English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a little weird" to go back to school.
“It was difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Until the war stopped last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza and escape the missile and murder fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border with Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian massacre granate, refused to return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily lodged in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city to Gaza, which is hardly drawn by the Palestinian conquest.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure that they acquire their knowledge and provide you with security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited arms ceasefire on Tuesday.
The arms relief led to an immediate end of the fighting, but important problems remain unsolved, such as the demand for Hamas after abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighters.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to start in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates of Palestinians and the UN.
Israel contests these data and estimates that at least half of the killing were fighters, however, there was no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 missiles and massacre granates during the fight against Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and approximately 250,000 people searched for refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary protective spaces.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protective spaces and continue to fight, educational authorities moved the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be opened again so that we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU Visa Strobl questions NPD ban procedures
Due to the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, the CDU federal visa Thomas Strobl has pledged to end the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU federal visa Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also CDU country chief in Baden-Württemberg, said the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD is politically fighting rather than the constitutional court.
The NPD had failed at the five-percent ward during the vote on Sunday.
A first approach to banning the right-wing party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection was then also in the NPD splits.
In December 2013, the Federal Council, after long preparation, filed a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now lodged in tents.
The Central First Refugee Recording in Harburg runs out of all branches.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were not informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck action continues to enforce the reserves of the citizens and give county politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the humanitarian accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of Greens at the Harburg County Assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg presently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be lodged in the three tents.
Reasons for the surplus in the first receipt are the storm of the applicants - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient spaces in successive facilities.
Many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
Housewives have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1% in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
With this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2%, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was at 10.9%, more than twice the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the rises were not equally distributed over the country.
RP Data’s research director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne were driving a double-shared market.
RP Data figures show that home prices in Sydney rose by 16.1% last year, compared with 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rise by an average of five to six percent.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been severely affected by government spending, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued to say that with the beginning of spring, it would now be a rise in real estate for the next months, which would undergo a "real test" of the market.
“If you consider the ongoing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the ongoing low interest rate, it is likely that the home prices will continue to rise in the next three months,” he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he opposed the statements of CEO Peer Medau and testified to posing "as a field master".
This is not the high school style, it is said in the statement.
Thus, the Medau family has already been informed orally about the insinuation of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he suggests that the plans are not "prefixation or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
Also, the expansion of the narrow road to the castle necessary for access is less dramatic than the medals.
It was nine meters wide and is not the word.
It goes at the current level of 5.50 meters, which is a meter broader than ever before,” Pötzl explains.
The argument of the medau operators that their free and school parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Trains are not parked at all because this can be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
The children's clip Bergwichtel, located on the ground and at the door of their home would lead access to the park cover, is intended to "not affect" according to the high school president.
Instead, he thinks that “it’s not only about the childhood, but also about the inhabitants of the enthusiasm to Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring Real School.
So it’s much more than the special interests of Mr. Medau,” Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the childhood council, with the expansion of the street, would be justified to lose a "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" "the reader can decide himself".
In early October, Pötzl, along with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and, in this regard, address the importance of the new resolution".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the child crash last week about the high school plans.
As a result, the access to the new parking lot should not be carried through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib Street, but through the Medau-Berg.
In this way, the narrow road must be expanded two-spiritally at about a kilometre length.
According to high calculations of the medals, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be ten times more.
Around 2,000 vehicles per day are spoken.
By the sides of the city, we did not want to express ourselves in this project.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal League SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised health problems for this decision.
I don’t like the decision, it’s ripe for several months.
“It’s time for me to listen to my body’s signals and end my career in the national team,” the World Champion of 2007 said on his Facebook page.
He has a balance of 167 country games and 576 doors for Germany in the international retirement status.
Because he wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced his framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation."
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasticed me as much as they will enthusiastic my long-term co-players and my followers.
But I would like to be healthy for my club in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career ending after a fever infection in 2012.
Due to Achilles' problems, he had been treated by team physicians of the German Handballbund (DHB) with a cortison injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
One emergency operation and two other interventions were followed.
Glandorf then announced a complaint against the crew doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career are going through no body.
I have some healthcare sites that I can’t ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012 in short periods, I have never properly handled my blood pressure.
For this reason there are other complaints related to the swallowing.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, I can’t deceive my body,” Glandorf said in an interview to the magazine Handball Time.
He would be ready for a comeback only in an absolute emergency.
“When all the strips are broken, I’m always ready to talk,” the two-family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012 I have become quite humble as to my health.
After my career, I would like to be able to go at least somehow right.
In addition to the 2007 championship title and the win of the Champions League 2014, he won 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) EHF Cup.
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup winner with Flensburg.
Germany’s economy collapsed by 0.2 percent in spring
The crisis around the globe has broke the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased from April to late June 2014 by 0.2 percent compared to the predecessor quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
Only the consumption survived the economy in the spring, while the investments declined.
External trade also brake the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual increase for the first half of the year, a total GDP plus of 0.8% compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and target of the "Münsterland museum", which led by the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday for the first time.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fiet drivers".
The largest bike sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Musterland Museum".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the bike paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the Münster country.
Written in various specialty magazines, this tour was offered to interests.
We come from the Heroes and have been driven overnight to participate in this round trip.
We also want to learn more about Münsterland in this way,” the cyclists are excited about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
Following the registration in the association of the Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went to a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, went towards Herrenholz over the creative mountain towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of height and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of height, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were taken care of on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Star Representative Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this bike sports event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all participants.
The organization left without any problems and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz Lölfing draws a positive part of the event.
Unfortunately, not so many participants came as expected by the organizer, which was likely the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
“We hope to see you again in 2015 with beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend,” the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Constantine Wacker's honest memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Konstantin Wacker, songmaker, pacific, police activist, ex-helpman, in "Mönch and Warriors" on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought feces for thought feces, the Municher, born on 1 June 1947, has written down his memories, each chapter initiated by an appropriate song text.
And he is unfairly honest: from onany as a gymnast to shop thief and drug consumption, he does not leave human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Wide space also incorporates abstract, but more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - everything he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacificism, his social criticism, his political commitment – and as he not only expressed the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Lastly, the living man, Konstantin Wacker, has also brought closer to the asketic monk, which “by subtraction” emerges, as he says, “to leave everything unnecessary.”
However, there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, over strokes in a GIs-frequent location or a crazy car ride, where he frontally viewed a tree.
He is also sincerely honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
I never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and his relationship was limited.
Henry tests for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and came out of the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with live melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "much" therapy after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
He never saw his face, he only heard his voice, "Hear the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went with him into the knife and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a dinner in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than his father’s times, he gained an insight into how life for him was like.
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, overwhelmed, deep stiff labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father just slept in the bathroom before, and then you could hear him slowly singing because he was able to wash his greed from himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became bigger.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love witnesses.
My father never troubled me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad to the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop shaking me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn’t we be friends?
She's a great mother.
She is still a friend of French who had been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn’t we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You must be radical.
So I passed this fitness and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat cartoons.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been accepted by the theater.
The comedy of the mistakes followed, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedians that have filled his job life.
He started at the age of 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote on New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for a long time."
He studied in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in public eyes, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke storytelling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people “painted black,” Henry introduced his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was an uncomfortable, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-old award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that both denied and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as chef of kitchen Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chief!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles featured his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought, "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you just take the time or go a bit out of the place."
Then came a documentary for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About ...?
The first result was Shakespeare.
I was usually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never learned anything right about him at school and held him mainly for a middle-class domain, white in stripes and a coalhead in front of him.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othellos' last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“This is why it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
Soon he appeared in the comedy of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the national theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake, and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice said to me, 'You have to overbridge now 10 minutes while repairing the computer.'"
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the scene and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a theater, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learn the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the seals.
It also happened well, so it’s like a big shield of gods who say to me, “This is your decree.”
He says this, of course, with a donated voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous eruptions, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you’re looking for it, you’re walking in front of a wall.
Sometimes I get up live in Apollo when I like it, but I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps form a start, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think it's okay.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen capital
In the conflict between the Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi followers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Jemenian media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post" Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday night.
Huthi threatened the blade with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be met.
The Shiite Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-governmental Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The peoples of the Huthi have occupied the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on Sanaa’s major routes.
In the country there is always a bloody struggle with the Jemenian army.
Kenya registers officials to call for "spiritual employees"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials biometrically to delete "spiritual employees" from the government's wage lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive payouts even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised at his 2013 office to fight corruption in public service.
In an investigation at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month were lost for payments for "spiritual employees" and other misused financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri told the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is recorded about the biometric registrations, was reported in a government message.
Everyone who would not do this without a credible apology would be deleted from the wage list, the statement continued.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and cleaning the salary list at both government levels - so the "spiritual staff" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Descentralization and Planning.
The scandal about the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated before the court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi-Gründers Theo Albrecht, claim in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Land Court 19,4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was reported by a court spokesman on Monday.
In the complaint, Achenbach has deceived when purchasing artworks and oldtimers and Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This also has increased the agreed provision.
Achenbach purchased value items for EUR 121 million for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, 23 of which was a school manager.
From this time on, Manfred judges know many well-known Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always weared by his efforts to see people in the student.
The snowtop is the most famous mountain in the Riesengeberg.
Manfred judge loves the painting with the motive from his homeland.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Nordböhmen in 1930, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in four years of high school for the teacher profession.
A year later, the Southern Germans were deported.
Within an hour, the family had to leave their house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the cargo car.
This is how the judge went into the Upper-Frankic Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers six times a week to the next train station, driving the train to Bamberg, where three kilometers across the city went to school and back tonight.
After two months, Manfred Judge got a sleeping place in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 co-students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he made the first and in 1954, after three years, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken had no free teacher place for him, he stayed in Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kolbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fraulein Room" was his first "Dienstwohnung" in the school house.
In 1958, he had a three-room service in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kolbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, they were collected in Petershausen at the present Rathaus.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
In order to escape a re-classification in the now smaller school, then director Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew up, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to the construction of today since September 1982, which was extended in 1997 after Judge’s retirement.
Manfred Judger praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who, in addition to municipal expenses, built a workspace and the 1997 enlargement, although this was not eligible for school buildings according to the directives.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," the judge recalled thankful.
During his entire career, Manfred Judge has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report of a school council on law and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Judge implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
“You have to give the children two kinds of roots and wings,” the 84-year-old said today.
And he had to learn: "This does not always succeed." Whether he only meant his students or his own six children just as well, it is not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When students were disturbed, they did not get a criminal work from him, and they were not even disturbed to settle.
At the expense of the congregation, the judge had set up two pairs of boxing gloves and allowed the two contractors to stand against each other, even if there should be a veil.
In the interests of the school, judges as the director took a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the partyless judge after his retirement to at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the Municipal Council.
The judge was elected six and joined the CSU.

HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten interim stops
When cyclists make rash on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten Rast, this is nothing special for themselves.
On Friday, however, only the number of rasters made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour as well as escorts enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the sky in the Schottener Alteburger Park.
Under the motto "Radeln and celebrate on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and there attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the wheelers took the first stage, 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
At Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed, and the manager of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, was welcomed.
To refresh body and mind were all kinds of prepared for good things: the land women from Ranstadt and Low-Mockstadt had 85 leaves of apples, sweat, strawberries and cheese cakes that marvelously wrapped on the powered wheels.
"So many cakes can only be backed by ladies," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while ordering another piece.
At the drinking level of the Geiß-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could have occurred.
The "Duo Bravo" hosted visitors with famous melodies from operas and musicals and collected enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
In addition, a master enjoyed a head massage from his partner: “He deserved it, finally he has fixed the already demolished bicycle chains today.”
Due to this, the mayor and the business director still had to work: they were interviewed at the spring before the drinking house of reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Tobias Hagen, Promotional Chief, since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004 as a tournament leader, was also able to go shortly, but he had a lot to do with the technology on site.
His pickup press, in which he communicated with his employees through three telephones and a radio device and the 15-headed motorcycle staff of the Hessen Police, wrote Facebook entries and made reporting, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westfalen are cyclists.
The number of participants is a bit based on the available accommodation capabilities.
In Category I, participants are lodged in hotels, in Category II in collection accommodations.
The wheelchairs had a good impression from the corridor when they broke again after an hour and a half, "Hello!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they said goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was able to make a short break.
But in the evening the wheelchairs were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful fest environment and of course had taste cakes, such as flame cakes with well-cooled fire whites, prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as CEO of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed visitors.
The three were obviously pleased with the "much operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen released the dance scene.
The opportunity to swiftly move under the free sky was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed by citizens who had been treated by the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, for cyclists, the stations Birstein, Guchtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the train squares - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of radelns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers are arrested for "conspiration" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of the "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
The police did not give immediate comments.
Among the detained are 14 high-level police officers, Hurriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organized criminal association and arrested telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamic Spiritual Fethulla in power positions against him and other people.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian peoplefront, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the school leader in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the next life.
The first school day of the New Year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing shirts, holding ballons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud celebrity clip from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own border experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons’ media world.
She was the chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when Pearsons’ mother company’s top position was attending a younger male colleague.
Its figure was claimed to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he sought for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the cabinet consultant.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
In May, I described the President's duty with a poisonous Kelch.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: inwards to the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwards as a voice of public concern and anxiety when things are running wrong.
This ensures a nearly unsustainable duopol that requires a comprehensive reform.
But what new president would risk entering into everything and separate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might bring himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it weren’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduces – power, money, and status.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies are threatening old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of licensing fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest amount of £145.50 per year, the British public purchases the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: she says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pennies a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising up on the popularity scale again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and use habits for the BBC have changed: Today I get message blocks on my phone and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loving and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she has found him.
Perry from Texas says downturn tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday contained a reduction in comments on the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official power.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perrys user account that denied the previous one.
Just a tweet was sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't cheap the tweet and have deleted it," he said later.
Perry employees did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perrys’ official user account were released, it was not clear who actually supports the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavourable image of the District Attorney of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was convicted in April 2013 for drunkness.
Perry introduced a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry—which might be 2016 presidential candidate—ahead of a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple-admissible alcohol level ... but if I do, I complain to Governor Perry when he explodes it."
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not trusted with the direction of investigating the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a Special State Attorney from San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded for non-innocent and called the accused a political trick.
His high-ranking team of defendants appealed to the judges in the case to reject the accusation and argued that the law against the oldest ministerial governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds from the State’s Public Integrity Unit – based in Travis County and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas – as Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This veto made a public complaint by a left-standing watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing at the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidate, Perry went on speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of himself in the jogging near a lake, saying "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares home market again for "normal"
One of London’s most prominent construction entrepreneurs pointed out that the housing market in Southeast England is back to normal level.
Houses in the capital were warmly desired and subject to enormous price rises, which caused the bank of England due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble to impose the upper limits for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 highest level" and added that it offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the flood, as foreign buyers were pushing into the capital.
According to information from the Catastrophe Office, the prices in the city area only rose by 18.5% last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales in total.
The average sales prices at Berkeley's private, affordable and student offers rose by about a fifth last year and were £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London in recent months less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been disturbed by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for a possible "ville tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which harder loan arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the rise of real estate prices in London for 2015 to lower to 3%, based on a already weakening home price awareness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive regions of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has declined by a quarter of the year, according to the broker WA Ellis.
However, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, since the amounts paid for time sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result the term sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the maximum level of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual tax return increased by 40 per cent annually to £280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to meet the current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual tax return of £450 million accordingly.
Berkeley's shares were fixed at £23.96 in London's trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hackers published on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar Award.
Naked photographs of Oscar laureate Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of more than 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "eclatant infringement of privacy."
The authorities were notified and will be traced by all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by an iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are true, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
“To those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I have taken years ago in the private environment of our home – I hope you are so satisfied with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however argued that the pictures about her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are GREAT, men."
Let’s get back to the beginnings. *Word game is intended*
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman of Popstar Ariana Grande resigned from her alleged photographs.
Exclusive extraction from Howard Jacobson's high-speed new novel about love and the letters "J".
They broke, so you could best describe it, they slowly solved themselves like a carton that was left standing in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, intense, intense, distant, and perhaps a bit cruel.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew Kratzbürgery.
He was stubborn, like Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stubbornness was a just-beginning affair that had been promising to relieve the loneliness of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a sharply sharp beauty with unpleasant hair and a flattered heart from a village on the north island, which was even more distant and harder than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, who held Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a wet but humid paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one lived in the house.
The pipes were leaks, in the bathrooms were no spices, naked sneakers had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to it all, and the garden was grown up with ungrain, which looked like huge cowheads.
It was like the house from a child mark, both threatening and attractive, a garden full of mysteries.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the long list for Man Booker Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been in the service console, which had been locked up by the country with a quiet music and a happy news of a black-speaking house, when the view of her long-speaking Enoughen brunette in the old-speaking song.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their harsh aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so forbidden - simply not played.
It was successfully obsoleted as the word obsolete.
The general taste succeeded in what releases and regulations had never been achieved, and as people choose from books the Vom-To-To-Millioner-Memory, Cookbooks and Love Romans, they chose the ballads in music.
In the Euphoria of the Day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a grob-comic Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"It was a famous song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, he told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game at that time, and it wasn’t really funny now.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
I had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it before.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly prohibited.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only a place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when the pop singer wasn’t black.
There were no laws or disagreements again.
A conform society meant that each element of this society agreed thanks to the principle of group talent—that was as grateful as those dismissed by the fate.
People of Afro-Caribian origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally originated from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and took care of the task to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What remained from the Polish community took care of the channelling; what remained from the Greeks, Teller collapsed.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levante whose grandparents did not have left the country quickly as WHAT WAR WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WAR WHEN WE WHEN WEWE WHEN WE were the flames would be consumed afterwards - had had lamb activity and shining.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard Balladen, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just predicted were ever verdicted.
Music was the expression of love.
“They are not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the negligible garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing was able to overcome the sound blowing of the gigantic cholaristic leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father love something like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he refused to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
But she thought he was something different.
"It seemed funny," he said instead.
She disbelieved her head and closed Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see around the world but your unhealthy rabbit hair.
There was nothing he would like to see.
"When you say it," I mean, without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're moving forward to me.
They seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked at it again.
Your feet aren't so straight.
Maybe your necklace, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my nose is too thick?
Hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
That's just that stupid song.
He could say "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"Your thick nozzles are exactly the reason why you fell to me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverted there.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be strange, he often suffered difficulties because he did not, as his father, have the calming charm he needed to overcome the graciousness inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
And Ailinn Solomon became red, and rose up from her chair, and threw the console, and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkness was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to sit like palm weeds in the storm.
"And your dick head is exactly the reason why I feel pervers to you," she said.
Except I'm not that.
She regretted him because of the unnecessary unpleasantness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned against him.
Did you think he'd beat them?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same giant and cold ocean broke down here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad after WAR as their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, went from kneipe to kneipe, always ready to lift up hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fault if she didn’t care!
She only knuts - knuts was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an anti-toxin to the unreasonable love ballads from the console - they only knuts and then beat.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the knutch itself already represented an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through his body.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but her sadness surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
You couldn't get to know each other.
She looked at him as far away — as from a room on the upper floor her companion watched him — a man complained about something he himself had sworn.
Adam left the garden, he thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, shamed her back, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a view she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember a single time she had seen something like that before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
A few years ago, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher, worked on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public mood, in a brief speech on continuing violence on low and medium levels of energy, invested in exactly the parts of the country, where the most likely to be eliminated and their reduction.
"It has already been done a lot, and a lot has to be done yet," she wrote, "to disturb the innate aggression of a people who led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was historically seen despite the high demanding church towers of the hacks.
But some properties appear as inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the less it appears, the less the passion he continues to wake up.
The people cry when listening to sentimental ballads, arguing about stories about overcome difficulties and claiming to believe firmly in the dignities of marriage and family life, but yet not only the previous roots hold the rural communities as well as our urban fields in their hands, but there are also evidence for the emergence of a new and even the backbone of the game.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to overcome," the mentor said when he read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum cut her head.
I also need to ask: Are you atheist?
“I don’t think I have to say that,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Esme once again appealed to her right to privacy and refuse the statement.
Feminist?
Silent again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy can sometimes distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudice against the Church, and these things that you call “inconsistent” and “roh” could be interpreted as well by others as an expression of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to walk around what is going on, when it is going on, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED script train in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the century or longer.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to Balladen, visit Musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence; singing is better than written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to go out of," Esme Nussbaum answered quietly when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, and I say nothing but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we form ourselves.
My concern is that we may find ourselves without notice in how we repeat the mistakes that have only led to what is done when it is done.
But this time it is not the others to whom we leave our anger and our disobedience.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to indicate an English debt.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "errors" that our grandparents may have or have not committed.
They also go too far if you say that they would have released their "what" and their "miss" to "other."
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past, as in the protection of the present, we are talking about "we" and "other."
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disturbance, that's all we know.
"When we are honest with ourselves," Esme claimed, "no part of society can claim to behave well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or done good, what happened has happened.
That was at that time.
There is nothing more to say about it - there we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be awarded, no guilt has to be removed if such an extermination is appropriate and if there is a way to forgive it.
But what serves the past if we don't learn from it -
The past serves to forget it.
If I can tell you something about it...
Luther Rabinowitz put his pyramid together.
"I'll think about her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was driven by a motorcycle driver who, as passagers described, had driven on a kind of "bruttal anger" on the road.
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says no state strike has been planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officers of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike for the government and said they had proceeded against police officers against whom the arms of political fanatics would be appealed.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and reported that the army of the country had surrounded its home and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting of assault threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was de facto no state strife, but that the military reacted to the threat by "political fanatics" whose weaponry occurred by the police.
“What happened today morning was that Lesotho’s defence staff acted after receiving several secret service reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to weapon some of the political, political young fanatics that were just before to fix devastating damage,” he said to Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a collapse.
"Even if no one claims that the government has been forced by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho so far show signs of a state crisis," he said.
Speakers of the Lesotho military reported on Sunday that the soldiers retreated in their casernes and remained calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during Thaban’s absence.
Thabane stated that he believes he has become a target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane exposed parliamentary sessions due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said his actions would not have untermined the government, despite other loud accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The rise in production in the euro area slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a thoroughly observed study.
The final market market manager index of the production industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An affirmation of more than 50 gives an expansion.
New orders fell down and factories experienced breaks in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The numbers come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan from the Bank to deal with a slowing recovery in the euro area as well as the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the ECB’s head Mario Draghi could make further information over the course of this week whether he considers a quantitative relief for the euro zone, in line with those taken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking impacts of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become clearer for the manufacturers,” said Rob Dobson, a leading economic scientist at Markit.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia’s largest trade partner in the EU, fell to the deepest in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI fell to 46.9. in the second largest economy of the block, France.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the departure of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer taking place are also calming,” said Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely to burst the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, CEO of IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say for the buying manager index of the Eurozone industry from August is that the sector continues to grow.”
“Producers in the eurozone find life at the moment obviously quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainty in the still challenging conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainty have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, in particular large orders.
He said it would be "more likely" that the ECB should finally launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The tenth of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible settlement of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken captive by Chechnya militia at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that the world shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
Just a decade after the tremendous settlement of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night from a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamic terrorists, children and parents took and killed, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, it seemed to be the evil one.
The tragedy unified West and East into Abscheu, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the worst of poverty.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom.
We found surprised young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will keep them on track forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children as they die - now ends.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to get back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried in her underwear to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and jumped in again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them safely.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be surgery again.
Some granate plates are still in my knees.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people as you have been helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she said.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change it.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young, and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the settlement will always remain a part of it, although the memory will be slightly weaker every year.
I am happy that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online as I go back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time understand our disaster and contribute to that something like that doesn’t happen again.
The boy who fled through the ball hagel, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school with 7 years of age) and survived the three-day settlement in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mom told me to stand up if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Come."
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled, and saw a crying little child on the way, caught it in his hand, and fled through a ball hull.
His father Vladimir, who put his son in his arms, said, “Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stolen outside and injured in the hospital, assuming her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, “I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and struck me.
Damir was later flying to London (from the recently dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will blow in my memory.
I remember taking all my toy guns away right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those children I played with in the courtyard and who haven’t managed to go out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the gambling store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster he and his friends suffered.
This horror chases you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I’m so sorry for all those suffering from the abominations,” said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the landing, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and that silence took many months.
She recalls lively her journey to London with Damir.
People in London wept when I told us our story.
Then I understood how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support.
She was thankful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember her and her husband’s meeting in London, and how Damir and I helped.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat bosch and invited her to all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with kellners in a restaurant, Damir shot her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think that this world hasn’t improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are just children like ours.
I think that for many of the war, it is part of the news they hear when they are injured or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past greed.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the gym and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered – I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turning his face away from us for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued to throw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, well-apparent, intelligent and healthy.
I could hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with parts of the body around me.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
"I remember I called him, 'Damir, run, run, run,' but I was too sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he fled.
And that's how life, unlike many others, continues for us.
George Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose terrible image after the landing became a symbol of Beslan's greed
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 settlement, a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Chechnya terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarey of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, a 54-year-old doctor, had suspended him for his first school day before she fled to bring her oldest son, Vladimir, to the university.
“I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists hit him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she said.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think about and talk about it.
There is no single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Invasive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was forced as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school on that day, and he said he wanted to swallow his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn’t like seeing the picture, and it’s hidden at home in the library.
I understand this, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij said today, “It’s important that something like this can never happen again.
“I doubt that we will ever learn the truth.
People are constantly examining such tragedy and never knowing the truth.
And now they are investigating the collapse of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
“I can’t understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing in such pain.
It takes decades to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a couple of sleeping rooms due to the landing, but then it became better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when the 1st September comes closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends tribute.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't give up.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Fanijew, 20 years old
The boy who survived although he was arrested at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A wonder: Georgij Fanijew was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the camp, but he managed to survive.
During the camp he was captured in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret agent, but couldn't do this because of his health damage due to the settlement.
It's still with me, there's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never come back there again and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after seating on the laptop
My pain is unhealthy and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think or talk about it and they never asked me to go to school.
I'm physically fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, including the medical documents, and they have answered that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, “I knew I would never report to my children about my experiences.
Children shouldn’t know anything about it and shouldn’t suffer, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgia won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. All of them are drawn here in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Georgij is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It’s hard to accept if something like that is unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate because of his knees.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he doesn’t run.
I would say he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always pursue us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the landing, which only strengthened my pain.
I have lost many people I knew well and were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make to me, but my heart cries about the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never been married again.
It’s hard to accept that life continues even if you don’t want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can’t believe it.
We were a friendly country before, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If we could only catch all these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was so greeted by a special use command, was secured
Salved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special use command (left).
She is 10 years old, and does not remember the cruelty at all.
The world kept breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried into the arms of a Russian police officer from Beslan's seat.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, at the time three years old, escaped, but Aljon's mother and sister died in the murderous gemetzel.
Her father Ruslan has been married again and has given his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the settlement and has grown up to a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," a close friend said.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of having passed girls on pedestrian transition in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands before the court because of the overthrow of a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian journey in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of having a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The accusation says Mr. Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, appeals to the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC began the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available at a price of less than $ 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other fields are closely locked.
Install your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and cameras have scene and recording modes that optimize the lighting time for the delicate underwater conditions.
And before jumping in, check to which depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others for up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many won't crash.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, Action cams are usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a luck case.
So make a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that uses a series of recordings with slightly altered illumination settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you get away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on earth, but it is even more important under water due to poor light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to go closer to your objects if they want to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an anesthetic advisor, he dedicated his career to save patients both the agony of the disease and the pains of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were important to diagnoses and diseases, while treated people were mainly busy with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started his path.
“I didn’t feel myself,” he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulty getting caught up.
While he fought with influenza-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet intolerant charges.
“I’d rather want everything right now than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unexpected.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was presented.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealthy cancer that attacks the breast, so that he attacks the skin overwhelming the lungs.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact cause is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbest loading - contact with the fiber construction material, which once was considered a "miracle" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbest is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbest has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, since the industry has voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Also, where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clampers, construction workers, roommen and workshop workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is unsuitable.
The UK, as it seems, today experiences the high point of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesotelium deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are now experiencing the fatal effects, although asbest has been illegal for years (all types of asbest have been banned in 1999), is that a mesothelium has developed only after decades.
And the mesothelium’s bulb is not limited to the former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
Therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class diseases, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastion, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, is no protection room.
Parliamentary buildings are asbest contaminated.
Also in hospitals in which we are to be healed have already been prepared as the beginning of this deadly cancer.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a climbing either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have been in contact with asbest.
Then he found out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I graduated for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pförtner - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my parents will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he could at least partly answer this question.
"From the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital and those who have been ill with Mesothelium in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last who is still alive."
How many of us are still sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio martial diseases die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are still sick?"
The UK’s leading expert in Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, says that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to be available in the UK, a total of 90,000 diseases will be killed.
Most of them have no idea that they will die.

A brief look at the documents of the courts, to which the affected individuals are frequently addressed due to damage claims, shows how much the mesotheliome’s shell has already been used.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted to Janice Allen’s extreme exposure to asbest.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of which was the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she began her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20s.
"Before this," she said, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't really know anything about asbest.
I would never have thought it would affect me.
There are only few people who know a lot about asbest.
The fact is that the term asbest refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbest, is today the most commonly found asbest in buildings.
It has been used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for braking covers in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbest, but it is considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible deaths.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Crokydolith).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbest, and experts suspected that “the clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the uniquely high mesothelium rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelium victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He presented a study of the affected people showing that "a substantial portion of the metholeum was caused by work or at home probably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the services and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbest, whose deadly fibers could be pressed by something as harmless as "stretched air movements".
Members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate", it is now uncontroversial that £1 billion workload must be applied over several years to renew Parliament to modernize electrical installations and remove the asbest center, and that after the general elections, the deputies will probably take place as well as in the West.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbest was not treated in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
One person who has never been able to accurately determine the contact with asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medical professional.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbot suspects he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbest complaints were positive,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day early December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and took a surgery just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had ice cream.
It came suddenly.
I felt awful.
I thought I couldn’t get the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn’t go to work a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and used Pleurakathether to extract liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and hard breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms arrived in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But now Abbott does not relate this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition became worse and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays into an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a camera-equipped sond was introduced into the cave between the rippen and the breastfell.
I am an optimist.
I usually go on,” he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy occurred in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesoteliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesotelium
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understands the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbest was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbest,” he said.
People who were exposed to asbest in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolation were underground in hospitals, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or eating underground cantons (like Graham Abbott often did), most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
For decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for treating doctors.
He is also removed today.
Students put their burning burners on asbest matte.
And it’s not just about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, stores, libraries and city halls due to its fabulous insulating and flaming properties.
Also schools.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemists, students have put their burning burners on asbest matte.
The topic of asbest in schools is often discussed on websites.
And because such innocent objects in our homes like floor plates or socket roofs have contained asbest by default.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in many parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that fell into a woman affected was the abbreviation of a garden cup in the 1970s.
So be careful how to remove your garden cups.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealthy, are enormous.
“It takes a while to process that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I was going and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As many patients before him, he recalls how overwhelming he was from all the information he had to face.
"It was very difficult to take it all," he said.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas party.
That was then."
Mesoteliom is particularly inherent because it is our life-saving mechanism - the breath itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesoteliom are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbest is absorbed and the fibers are inhaled, they can fix themselves in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbest fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhalated needle-shaped asbest fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-throax doctor, who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, from which Andrew Lawson is suspected to have exposed him to asbest, is now ironicly a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestnails reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well with mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is controversial.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denied it.
“You can’t cut off the chest,” he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because cancer speaks “not very well on chemotherapy,” which “shows effect,” but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis had become a single-man support and advisory office for co-conflicts.
"Hello, cancer center," he exclaimed gladly when calling.
"He was very positive," Abbott said.
He had received his diagnosis four years ago and was still very active.
Abbott was originally offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to make things appear in a slightly more positive light.
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I didn't have to be transferred, I just called and got a date," Graham added.
A normal patient should have to receive a transfer and have to wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesoteliom diseases to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail inevitably, many are affected by another financial concern - the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the courts in hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbest is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that you realized that a very low burden also was a health risk.
And here the company’s negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally introduced their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "complete compensation" since Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesoteliom was due to a Guy's asbest contact.
However, after his investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "asbest fibers were removed in the affected cell area in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbest
In fact, for mesoteliom diseases that strive for compensation, it is an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbest contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
In response to this, there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for Mesotelium affected to complain about compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has established a £350 million fund sponsored by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can demonstrate a contact, but no one can complain.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could say to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the program are expected annually.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many Mesothelium affected that £350 million represented a "very good job" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, indicating that this sum is about a quarter of what insurers had to pay if the time had not gone out and Mesoteliom diseases could find companies and normally complain.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan stated that a quick action is needed in the face of seven deaths every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesoteliom law last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After his first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with the long-lazdunski being able to present a survival rate of up to 40% over five years.
Abbott felt strong.
“That’s the most important thing,” Abbott says.
This is often seen in patients.
There's something that allows you to continue.
If you give up, it's going worse quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flakes around my chest.
I was just 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Abbott was subjected to six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very hard.
You need to think of practical things - about money if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the bottle setup works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“That’s hard for parents,” he said.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease that I wouldn’t get old.
They reacted completely differently.
Tamsin is very happy and unexpected.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restraint.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to pass through.
But for mesotheliomerc diseases such conversations have not been conducted by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as in the end for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a gorgeous security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear paying
The Chinese parliament on Sunday, despite the increased reputation for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong voters.
This action is likely to blow the long-running protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization of this within a few hours after the dismissal.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking candidates.
“It doesn’t happen unexpectedly, but it makes us angry,” said legal expert Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That’s not what Beijing promised.
The residents of Hong Kong have been lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approbation of public nominations in the Hong Kong government elections would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain gave back control over Hong Kong to Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow residents to elect government presidency since 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakdown because it has a direct voting right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the run through a closely controlled Beijing Nomination Committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates are allowed "with love for land and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most effective public protests have been held in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to fire the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general voting law.
On Sunday night, hundreds of Occupy Central followers had gathered in the rain before the headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the dismissal.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers reported that the movement "have considered the occupation of the Central District only as the last means, an action that is to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exploited and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exploited and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing’s announcement, and on Sunday before the government building, security measures, including police forces and barricades, were being taken.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The addition of people from the continent strengthens the competition for products and services.
The fear also increases that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement as it threatened the business - the life of Hong Kong.
“The protests that they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved in it and how long it will last,” said Regine Ip, a legal expert who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported the Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now transferred to universities where Freshmen shows are offered with the private plane.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury travel service for today’s students.
The company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, otherwise, have to beat their jealousy in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet, since the service was just introduced, however, he added that "students would book the service in the coming weeks."
The company also reported that despite the £9,000 student fees a year it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and claims from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can exactly do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of most students.
Many students who start this month studying are exposed to a crisis of living costs as the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not take a step with the strongly rising bills for the easiest basis of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the student’s home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted up their hands into the air and sang, “Shock up, don’t shoot,” while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of an armed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white women.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the gender in front of the race when it comes to dealing with reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the middle west rose and gained attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned around the race to 100%.
In comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9, the personal essays with titles such as "The thoughts of Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez it meant a significant change.
“I don’t think there are many people in feminism who are talking about white and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed every day, but not regarded as "female themes" in cultural space.
“I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colors are in their own country, the silence is eager to hear.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no disotomie between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the subjects clean; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the subjects of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were shine, and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right of choice such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of choice could only be successful for a group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to engage in women's right of choice, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power becomes aware of why colorful women don’t trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the voting right in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized against the Lynch in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the issues raised by Ferguson – police behaviour, racial discrimination – is a mirror of the time when white feminists “captured” with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
“Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminism platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to pregnancy control?” asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built their career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, Guardian columnist, in which she demanded more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
“I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand one of the inner dangers of the body – and opinions about the race that are significantly different in public surveys – will lead to the changes,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, in which racial as well as gender themes are discussed, some of their comments on racial theme in America are still surprised.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, particularly young colorful men, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions of many female women, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that leads to mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police captured nearly 63,000 uncompanded minors at the southern west border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes back to the surface - this time as a woman's theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examinement of the topic as an essential woman, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of the work visa goes to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a posthall in women's organizations," she said.
"Pine House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers, as it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The freestanding house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig who had put his head on a sofa.
Real estate broker Connells said the pig on the photo was the owner's pet.
"But the photo was misleading and was removed right now," a spokeswoman of the company said.
In the House's Exposé, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of houses in social media was of interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW City Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto Winning
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the lottery rise on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner has to sign up.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the winnings were provided for conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a proper finish for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had earned a Mega win of $7.5 million just a few weeks before.
The winner’s pair had played for twenty years and said the win allows them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas falls in the Gladiator Day
Not only the Gladiators were deep in the match at the first Rheinbacher Romerdag in the leisure park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who despite the rainforests and the autumn cold, and were unexpectedly enthusiastic about the historical speculation.
There was a colorful array of performances, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troops from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used each rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and skilled presenter and sent his men to the ring for a heroic twin fight in various gladiator functions.
First, the "provocators" were on the line with right-wing shelf and shortcut as well as legs on the left leg and arms on the right arm.
They followed the "Essedarii" with breastschild, short shell and roots, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which struck the "secutor" with a thread, threeizack and Dolch, and struck the burdens to the ground after a short battle.
At that time the swords were metally strengthened, shattered the shields, and the roots flew surrendering through the arena that a fear and fear could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on that, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the musculoskeletal arbitrator, had a always noticeable eye.
"We wanted to make the Roman everyday life revive and make the culture of the Roman times liveable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Frienddeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the speculation.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, was found by Vice-Mayor Claus Wehage in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings we admire today.
The remains of it were also amazed on the day of Rome, such as "Aquadukt-Marble" from the 11 metres high and 1400 metres long Romerkanal Bridge, which was then at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now presented the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: “We are still taking advantage of the knowledge of that time.”
This also confirms Diploma Measurement Engineer Ralph Heiliger by the "Ingegner teamZwei" from Rheinbach, presented the Measurement Instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented skies and models from the excavations anno 1894 as well as sea stones from the original Hypocauste, the warm air heating, which once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of ton before they burned it.
In 2011, the Land Memorial Care Office at the Rheinland Land Association had buried the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Industrial Park in Rheinbach.
You have found an extensive wall of an economic building with a torch to dry grain and to melt.
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, a farm good, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of pieces of these excavations presented it in a glass wine, including a large container, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a ceramic necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century B.C. to the accident of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
At her, the children also engaged in the Roman wind moulding game, similar to today’s wind moulding game, or they wrote their names, like once the Roman students, with metal griffs on washing tables.
At the stand of the Roman thermal Zülpich, the children were able to lay mosaics themselves, to bast mosaics at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach and to use a heavy wheat mushroom of stone to paint the meal for a flat bread or a musli.
With the originally-built Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed through the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, presenting the results of their "Roman Weeks" project.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Roman year 2014, which will be recalled the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the native and historic associations, the Wachtberg Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laien Gaming Circle Oberbachem are offered, among other things, the thematic walks, lectures, coaching and guides for school classes and reminding Wachtbergs of the Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionary tells about his work on the Wachtberg, introduced plants as living monuments from the Roman era and presented a funny teaching hours on people’s understanding between a group of Wachtbergers “Germans” and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule is dedicated to the roman theme during a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be reexperienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminded of the Fund of the Berkumer Matronen Sainthood in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic loads West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious strike for the economy.
Markets are planted - and international companies go away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic causes the economy of West Africa a severe strike.
The harvest is rooted on the fields that mines are left and the markets are rooted - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already going away.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic crisis,” said Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest affected
“It’s a total disaster, we lose a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola are on the market.
Liberia was the hardest hit by the virus, and more than 600 people were killed by the fever alone.
Recently, health authorities have stated that the disease has occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands of others joined themselves.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the wealthy countries, companies operate their business.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also respond: Only a few merchants leave their hometowns to take care of posts.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, under quarantine, among other things, the cake and coffee beans important for export are rooted in the fields.
The farmers do not hesitate to leave their home for the harvest.
Foods are hardly
“People are going to travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris’ economic expert in West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: foods are scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foods such as rice is depleted.
At the same time, the region that is highly dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies are basically avoiding the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon from the French Think Tank Iris.
It is important how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that “it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also charges the strapacious state budgets of the States
The disease also loads the strapacious state budgets of the affected States.
Moody’s rating agency fears that their budgets will be strongly strapacked by the high expenditure for the health system and, in addition, by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also traumatic in Nigeria, where only few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed so far.
However, the oil-rich region in southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying home from fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels also decrease significantly.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
Berngau's protective association "Tannenwald" celebrates its 50th anniversary of its founding festival from September 12 to 14th.
On high tours, the Tannenwald Schützenverein prepares for the 50th anniversary of the establishment festival from 12 to 14 September.
Planned on Friday, September 12th, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 18:00 p.m., there is a big shooting.
Then, in the large fixed tent, the mood night with the "Stopfaller Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the Fest goddess service and 9:30 p.m. in the Pfarrkirche and the great festivity at 14 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the federal and Gauss shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirndlns.
The festive chapel is the blasphemous Berngau chapel.
The screen dominance took over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schutzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" originated in 1907, when the association for social entertainment was founded on 21 March "by exercise in room-stutzen and small-calibre shooting".
The NS regime in 1937 caused the dissolution of the association.
Until 1964, 19 young men again met who on April 30, at the guesthouse of Lukas raised the "new" shield company "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a shooter master through a difficult start-up time in which it was primarily about finding an association location and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein in the guesthouse "Leininger" started with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shots, which were currently organized in seven teams, established in all classes to the 1st Gauliga.
The association record was purpled annually and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shields has increased, the numbers of members have also developed positively.
After the local "Leininger" association no longer has enough to claim a modern shield unit, the then government under Johann Rinn’s leadership has decided to create a future dominance in the chambers of the new "Landgasthof Hardteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours on 8 May 1988, Pfarrer Strasser granted the church blessings for the new fireplaces.
One of the greatest highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gauss shooting, associated with the celebration of the new shield in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Shifter Association celebrated its 30th anniversary of its founding.
1995 was founded a shareholder group.
Josef Schmalzl became a reporter.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the general association was the focus of the Bayerian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facility in Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought the latest technology.
11 teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performances of the guard team.
A total of 11 teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air gun teams, one air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the 2013/14 round from the Gauoberliga (highest league in Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Shohmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauober League.
In addition to the shooting sport, there are events such as bockstechen, faschings and kingsball, association excursion and Christmas tradition.
At the same time, there are also shields at the feasts in Pfarrei and the community.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race race ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after his right-wing front tyres dropped around 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better job and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope that we can do it better.
Stewart ran earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I have come in today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, and added, "it just hasn't managed."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s truck was loaded into the slider and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races out after his car hit and killed another driver at a racing racing in northern New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or in the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had been on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities reported on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident would last at least two weeks.
There has not been a decision yet on whether Stewart has to wait for an accusation.
The three-time champion was received greatly when he was introduced before the race.
After starting at 12th position, Stewart was shortly afterwards in the first 10 advances and was temporarily in place four.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs hit
Cars with no. 18 without control after the exit of the curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dancing Friendly Success Search
Simply try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Chief Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to competitors.

Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in Sofia’s capital.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher wages are also on a claim list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officials have protested symbolically against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour sheets.
Despite the meetings between the Association of Prisoners and Representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations continue, the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the Union Association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still in progress.
After severe battles, which allegedly were involved in Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, has abandoned the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
The army also reported that seven soldiers have been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists fired plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have again shot a fighter plane and two military heads.
Around 100 soldiers were injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, the rebels reported on Monday by Russian agencies.
ships of the coastal guard
The rebels also claimed that for the first time in the Azov Sea, two ships of the Ukrainian coastal guard were depleted.
Ukraine's border guard confirmed that two of his ships had been beaten on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev said to the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
In addition, the separatists reported that several villages in the region of Donezk had been controlled.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian contact group meets.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and OSCE, a messenger of separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate in this.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicize their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not breach its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO held the 1997 NATO-Russian Council founding agreement.
NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a collapse of the deal."
“Today we need to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
From documents and comments from the Russian side, "they consider us opponents."
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that he wants to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A decisive “Readyness Action Plan” at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute, officially.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still expected that the European Union decides whether it will also send a representative to the negotiations.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no longer received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Later, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe covers about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel says power word: Maut will become “a little clear”
Now the Chancellor is clearly committed to this.
A freelancer for all complicated details, however, is not.
The CDU’s hard-hearted concerns against the car math have devastated the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent oppositions from her CDU, spoke a word of power for the introduction of a car death.
"To be clear: she is in the coalition treaty, and she will come," the party chieffin said Monday after meetings of the CDU Special Boards in Berlin.
Merkel did not have a detailed model, however.
The black-red government program is called "specific parameters".
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal, and on which it is now going to continue".
However, the NRW CDU holds on its no to a foot on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively introducing himself into the consultations for a bill.
In addition to this, he also discussed with Dobrindt other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "speel" report uncommon on Sunday, his house examines his own concept to compensate highway investors with matte income - after the election 2017.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned to develop concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU federal visa Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty never went out of covering all circular and federal roads," the North Rhine-Western CDU country president said.
As a matter of fact, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk about the subject again.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU countries associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Pfalz.
There are fears that a measure will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had requested the CDU coalition strike due to the maut criticism.
The left views the plans in the face of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks-death is dead," said Partichef Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker newspaper" (Monday).
"With the Maut the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
Inland car owners may not be charged in accordance with the coalition contract.
Therefore, they must receive a full compensation for the maut over the Kfz-set.
However, foreign drivers should not benefit from their nationality under EU law.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman said she thought as a result of a failure diagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and backbone.
Charity CMT UK reported that defect diagnosis are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motory disorders such as muscle weakness, unsafe running and curved edges.
Disease also suffers from feelings of swelling or pain. The disease is unhealthy and progressive, meaning the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything lasted for me longer.
I could never ride with the other children roller boot or skateboard and was often driven to go in school because of my kind and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several operations to discharge her acrylic seeds and stretch her feet, she included her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and terriblely paniced.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair when I was 18 and die when I was 25, and then I would slowly lose all my skills.
I did all this with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she became clear that she hadn't taken her skills as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just woke up and knocked me up and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have that, otherwise you’re already in the wheelchair.”
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a month of CMT awareness to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has worked as a fireworker since the closure of the former military exercise place
For nearly ten years, there has been no shooting at the former military exercise in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, fatal ammunition occurs every month in the heart of the biosphere region of Schwäbische Alb.
Granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be sprayed on site.
An ear-inspiring knall hears the explosions over the heartpiece of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shooting fell on the Münsingen Military Exercise Square, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6,500 hectares large area has been the core piece of the biosphere area Schwäbische Alb, which has been opened for hiking and cyclists on 13 designated roads.
Tax loads of businessmen in the Washington area rise with economic recovery
The recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for businesses in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the area District, Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, a 3.8% increase compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier year, and it was the third year of growth following several years of declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased stronger than local taxes by 4.3%, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia gets 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is justified in the recovery of corporate real estate values, researchers say, which led to a 3.7% increase in real estate taxes this year, with growth rates of less than 1% in three consecutive years.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, the run appears to apply to Washington’s space.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia paid together over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2% over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes are about just more than a fifth of corporate tax decisions here.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
“In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations who do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, CEO of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other States offer.
The latest recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be calculated only by the recovery of the real estate market
Business revenues also appear to be recovered, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes to government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses does not rise equally in all three places.
The rise rate in the district corresponded to 4.3 per cent to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher to 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1%.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes in all three departments with 6% (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and a better tax climate is generally governed than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not investigated.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5% next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State’s corporate income tax rate by 2017 to 3%.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to go better, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure, according to which most small businesses are organized - in District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than overall corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country will likely stop this year, with a rise of the overall VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could be ignored if the federal government’s expenditure cuts affect the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German beer for Guangzhou
Hope and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China is now looking for a browse and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, brown in Frankfurt’s partner city Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of officials in China.
“We would be very pleased if a German bride would be settled in our city,” said Li Yiwei, Vice-Participate Secretary of South China’s metropolitan metropolitan this week, visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the ruling Communist Party of China has repeatedly returned during the conversation on this concern of the Twelve Million Metropoles.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the power to buy German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, grain and life pleasure," he added at lunch with the party work in Guangzhou.
This life-joy is already shining, Mr. Li, he screamed to the host.
After that, the Guangzhou official came up with shaver-gum - but with red wine served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German brush art.
Tsingtao beer is used according to the German purity order.
More Business Traffic
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice-Partichef Li said.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but was deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be rewarded again,” the municipal politician convinced.
“The business between our two cities is increasing.”
Currently, travellers have to take the journey over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, made this wish ahead of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel, China's Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German expert, agreed.
Careful Partnership
The Chief Executive Officer of Guangzhou hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office only this year after his predecessor was transported from the office for corruption claims.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration carried out by Chief State Xi Jinping with hardship.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked before his party career for an American company, which is extremely unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his arrival in Guangzhou, he worked as a top official in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000km away Guangzhou belongs to those cared for on both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year existence of the German-China connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolitan on the Perlflus is almost as strong as its economic power.
In the next year, they would like to reach a gross domestic product of €250 billion, Li said.
Family of Joan Rivers "Press the Dungeon"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she entered a hospital in New York City, but her daughter today has been hoping that the 81-year-old comic girl is recovering from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all pushing the smoke.
According to sources, her mother was introduced to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency in a clinic at Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors deliberately keep them seated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which will continue to be described as "the most severe".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust absorbers and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards are subject to cars and dust-savings that come into trade from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new dust-savings from September 1 will be received on a label where the buyer can identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, harder nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class Euro 6.
Additionally, there is more money for the equipment builders: they will receive a federally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buy the Twitch video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected Twitch’s acquisition, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it seemed like selling Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion was decided, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravery pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", as an insider said.
The Twitch Interface.
And "let's play" is a video genre in which the best-security of the (mostly older) plays a string of secret science theatre is already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat desperate, an example of a set-up technology company that purchases a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this is the statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have chosen for Amazon because they believe in our community, share our values and long-term visions and want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to exercise sport rather than watching it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others while playing instead of taking the control console in the hands of themselves.
It’s one thing to look at a friend over his shoulders at 3:00 a.m. while she’s knocking through Resident Evil, and something completely different to watch a spinner shooting him 20 times in his head in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good recipe for headache.
I admit that the fast-track courses in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play all the games in record time are fun.
But as long as there is no game or humor, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth-largest source of internet traffic points.
How exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just slipped.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: Thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As Twitch’s president, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch “believing both in the future of gaming,” and the media shows no signs of a crash, not even – a sluck – as a spectator.
At the Hüpfburg at Burggartenfest there was a lot on Sunday night.
The concept of the organizers voted.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday night, estimated 1200 music fans arrived at the Open Air Festival in the Burggarten.
Sometimes the entry had to be stopped.
“That was angry,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltwater l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in Saltwooder Burggarten is to emit brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway from itself.
This happened early Sunday night when the first visitors arrived at the Open Air.
A celebration for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that's what they did.
Around the supply stations on the Burggartenwies there were saltwoodlers, but also guests from the nearby and other surroundings were comfortable.
They followed the first live appearances, wiped with the foot in tact, enjoyed cool beverages - shortly: relaxing pur and enjoyment were noted.
And that through generations.
While one on the ceiling on the extra-carried white sand lightened at the beach bar, others laughed at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the descendants tobted on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction point for the smaller guests.
But even in child makeup, the volunteer helpers in the real sense of the word had to do all their hands full to become the Lord of the Andrang and to magnify fantasy creations in the small faces.
The larger used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop directed by the Goodfoot-Crew from saltwood.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17:30, he pushed on the visitors, especially families looking for the breadth and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the party did not break this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who said from a "success on the whole line."
That’s why there’s nothing against the repetition of the big party next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday to the people votes.
He was angry to say that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.
The following: Some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salt Dealer co-organizator spoke of about 1,200 visitors who stumbled in the Burger Garden.
There were problems with sound engineering.
The hip-hop band blocks`n`Rox broke their appearance off.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges were unable to be built because the tents were unable to be brought into salt soil due to a tire panel.
“But next year they will be there,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some mistakes that will still be forgiven for the first time, but they have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Facebook also needs to criticize the organizers on the social network.
"I'm sorry, but for 12 euros you just have expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event site.
“You’ve taken a little,” says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so narrowly.
I think it’s very good that some people not only talk stupid, but also really try to put something on their legs.
"Come out!" writes Stephanie Jens to Amula.
Now, the organizers remain a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's monuments crash
It isn't expected.
Instead, the ready-made component is waiting for use in the distinctive building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA Space Observatory Radar, the so-called Radom will be completely renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller than the old with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size remains a world record.
The last step towards completion of the new helmet is the cover exchange
The upper quarter of the old helmet is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new house will be set up.
If the weather plays along, the action will go through the scene at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenges Featuring Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when her icy water was thrown over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenging went painfully.
A woman was brought to the hospital after she shouted so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she cut off her cheese.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK grew so much when her ice cold water was thrown over her head that she injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my chicken remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shipped over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the kiefer was crushed, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister also saw this and almost laughed in the pants, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was introduced to the hospital to re-reduce the kiefer after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has been linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the burglars soon pull back on a strang?
Later, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now, the boards think about possible cooperation.
As an example of the rebuild of Wolfratshauser Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former President of Wolfratshauser Burgfriend, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfriend Wolfratshausen.
So far, the points of view seemed to be different as to how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now, the two camps are moving to one another: talks about a common approach will soon be conducted.
This is confirmed by the associations of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could be together once,” says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of the two associations could go back to a strike in the future.
This is how to make more visible successes.
While the Burgfriend around the sudden deceased Richard Dimbath had a rebuild of the castle at the Bergwald in the eye, for the Burgverein around Sjöberg stands the "closing and survival" of the Glend.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the Burgfriend, has been very pleased by his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been facing the Burgfriend.
A new chairman should be found in a member assembly in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association has about 40 members.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we first let the association activities rest from respect." This "think phase" was necessary to "think how it could go further".
According to Piffl, the new chairman is going to talk to the Burgverein.
Until that time, Burgfriends could also make an up-to-date mood within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to candidate himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Talzer wants to work on the project "but very happy to continue to work".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the future.
He honored Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the rebuild of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was skeptical at the beginning too.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is meaningful to advance the project, and a "all-setting character" could be created for the Flößer city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be funded by EU funds, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"Therefore, I personally don't want to throw the idea of rebuild on board." He hopes that the court may move somewhat at this point.
Their goal to document the story first is "important and good".
Then you could continue to see it.
Clever ways to save at Uni-teaching books
Since the cost of university teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, fast-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever savings.
He invented a rental system for books of students of a higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay re-sales.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-kit," said Schroeder, 19, who visits Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The college management reported that students spend on average more than $1,200 per year on teaching books and study materials, but there are different cost-dumping options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as scroeders are increasingly the solution to the choice for students.
Renting teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstore stores, reported that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in college libraries in the last spring semester, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores Trade Association.
Here is the only one for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler cost nearly $290, but can be charged with the specialized Chegg.com teacher book dealer for $239.99.
Buy used
If any of the notes of other or normal use tracks are not a good option, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have at Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditures are permitted.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the workshops.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com is also a popular alternative to used books by eBay Inc.
Hire
Renting lessons is worth considering if you treat them somehow well, remember to give them back and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semestre for about $20.
Information about the provisions of the business you hire, including the penalties applicable to writing notes, submissions or tracks of use.
If you do not return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books are also an option instead of traditional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a given period of time by wholesale such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers as many classics can be downloaded free today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Surely look at it.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right tutorial.
And before an online order, you should check Gault if the book is actually stocked.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" hasn't become a cash hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" played only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape" on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on the opening week, while children's films like "Dragon's 2 made light" also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "drake frames made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and at least 2000 leather walls in the current year.
The results are based on the views of cinemas and film critics and suggest that the film hits of this year are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing visual habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s short-lived jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, “I believe the times are changing.”
We need to accept this and not try to go through the past.
Unlike the current low cash performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved revenue with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which the revenue was $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for being too focused on films of Comics and prophesying Hollywood's "crime mixing".
In the light of the current dissolution, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may contain a real core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
Producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
When the second table tennis district class was deleted a few years ago for the purpose of punishment of the League division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Table Tennisbund has introduced an additional 3rd Bundesliga in the program.
The following: Whoever hasn’t ascended has descended.
As a result, the top-class team of Göttingen Torpedo in the Upper League League has avoided the decline, but in the upcoming season it is only five-class.
Four-class Torpedos Women remains, despite their magnificent crossing into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserves join the new association league, in the national league no longer represent Göttinger clubs.
In the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Association League, the Torpedo second in the country League.
What the composition looks like a better district class is now the new districtsoberliga South.
Here are TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Overvender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC.
In the district league, the regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende play, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The ladies’ district league begins at least in sunset.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also, the SCW youth’s district league season – Torpedo II still starts there – is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger circles start with each nine teams.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staffel, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are also available.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the ring of Osterode, where there are no ladies teams at the level of the ring.
Surprisingly, no one of the six second round classes reaches the thickness of the sun, here the innovative and circular circuit board will have to think about once.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday about 150 people gathered in Cardiff before the city hall to hold a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flying from the Blue Mountains
TWO youth bushes were secured with the sea wind after they were captured overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man started their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
The worried relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two weren't home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 p.m.
The girl had been injured on her knees and the man was crushed and struck his head.
The rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were flying on Monday morning.
They were introduced to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance car.
Government enemy protests escalate in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After about half an hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with pieces had damaged devices in the editing.
Dead or injured have not been reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the Governing Chairman to whom they claim election fraud.
Police reported that about a kilometre away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence, there were approximately 3,000 demonstrators with security forces coming back on Monday.
According to hospital data, a police officer was injured.
At least three people were killed on weekends, and more than 500 were injured as demonstrators tried to go to Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday night after a meeting in the Army Headquarters, "without wasting time and using without violence."
The statement said, "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused concerns about an intervention of the military, which has already pushed more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been held since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had invited their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having Sharif forced to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan suggests Sharif won the parliamentary election in May by fraud.
Qadri calls for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the election system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are being used to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had first endured peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri urged them to go to Sharif’s residence on weekends.
Hütteldorfer after the second season victory on the third place of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week for Rapid took a peaceful end on Sunday.
"The victory is very free," said trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an interim with the outfit in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who with green-white in front of the third place.
Schrammel-Drumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid with the second season winning has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience in the country gambling pause.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership-Volley from the sixteenth ring in the 14th minute, made the weighings win.
"I thought I had been cleaning all the frustration from Thursday and shaking it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had last met in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship in Rapid Tress will therefore remain in special memory.
“For me this is something very special, I am from the Rapid Growth,” said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic’s short-term bean-blesser, scrambled from the left to the right defense side and made his thing very well there.
He has enough experience to be able to misuse this position as well.
The Tor has earned it, he has already managed some assists,” said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have written before.
“Thank God we have had some luck today,” Schrammel also noted, who played with this on the score of performance and results in the past weeks: “The results have not voted, but the game game was always good compared to last year.”
Barisic even found that you had been “better in many games than before” – against “the strongest team that played this season at this stadium.”
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the crew's assignment is intact despite the retreats: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
Not less enjoyable for him: “We have finally played to zero again.”
Also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are complaining about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
“You can’t forget that,” Barisic, who lost with Behrendt and Pavelic players in the last three days, said, “who were very stable in recent times.”
The country’s gambling pause must therefore be used to “leak out the waves and put a little in the physical area,” Barisic, who has five U21 outlets in his rows.
One of those who seem to be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the team, it's about pain.
At this very difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his 68th minute exchange not only the structure, but also achieved the second door.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: “Don’t believe that everything’s right now” “We’ve probably had a little luck, but sometime luck has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time,” Hofmann said.
He urged to be focused on continuing work: “You can’t always see it black and white.
We haven’t played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we should not believe that everything is okay now.
He couldn’t dispute his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
“They are at some stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to go on with his team.
He regretted the quick counterpart "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which was unrecognized by arbitrator colleagues.
The only claim I can make to the crew is that we weren’t specific enough towards Tor in some stages.
We had too little degrees.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner looked like: “It just started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a door.
In general, it would have been more in it.
Under this pigeon, there is rest
We showed a powerful tribe at our mysterious release of the summer series "My piece of Rhiner happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the land circle, the depicted exemplary is the "hot dryer" above the underwear browns.
A hollow footway leads to the 600-year-old eagle.
It passes through groups, bass stone heads and bass stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it climbs beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds of a range of over eight meters to an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a tree tree indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intense research, there were only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has further consulted the Bishopsheim’s archive and asked older people from underwear brown to find out what it has to do with the brush.
The result of his research remained a rather narrow explanation for the name.
As a result, by about 80 years ago, the cows must have carried their animals out of under-skinned browns to the hard rooted and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the tired animal guards shall rest from the rise.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance back, because on the beans, indeed, the cattle are swallowed again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When the stone collections enter, however, you should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun is also a popular place of residence for cruises.
A walkway leads from underwear brown to the tree, but lies something hidden.
Other routes are painted, riding in the direction of the highway and invited to an extended hike.
Where is the waterburg?
A waterburg that is searched for at our next task, however, is rather rare to find at the height.
The mirroring in the tomb already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the country circle that could fit the building’s interface.
Where is our "piece of Rhiner happiness"?

After a week’s turnover, Italy’s Prime Minister and official EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, has nominated its Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she will be the successor of British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers the nearest government newspaper La Repubblica to reiterate the calling of Mogherini as a favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects an exit for his “reform package” in Italy.
Finally, Renzi hopes that the left-wing parties will still be calm again against him, because Mogherini will be assigned to this - even more moderately.
Concerning the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will be made in order to make a political balance.
At the same time, the EU's Chief Diplomacy will be the Deputy Representative of Commission President Juncker.
The remaining approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would barely have called the nomination of a 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, known for its ambition, that has been proven in leading party offices for nearly two decades, will become the "normal challenges".
The married woman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined Margherita’s Catholic Central Party in 2008 to today’s social-democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists).
With the 2001 elections in the Left Democratic Party Council, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head soon became.
She occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was conducted by studies on NATO action in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the House of Deputies, in which she is an expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which has contributed to more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, Federica Mogherini has a share of it, as stated in the PD crisis.
The discussions in Brussels, which the new EU Foreign Office has too little diplomatic experience, therefore lacks substance, are discussed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially Poland and the Baltic members, the realistic accents of Mogherinis are missing on the crisis in Ukraine and diffamated as a “Russian-friendly course”.
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly through the Russian natural gas to South Europe, as well as the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi entered his office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for his first visit to Moscow.
Photographs they showed with Putin during the Shake-hand were taken in Brussels with enthusiasm, as well as invited the Kremlin-Chef to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
In total, nine young people started training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, new employees are active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronikers (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the village of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new educators had previously visited both primary or related high schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all year rounds, as well as the trainers, go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day walk and Rafting at the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over every year is 27.
“The socialists in France should “hold their mouth and make France okay,” Francois Hollande’s major allies said.
Mr. Valls called on the deep-scale left to show "her love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet formation has been hit by the great majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay at his side," he said in a big applause.
As a controversial gesture, the Prime Minister argued that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands after locking the regulation by the new Economy Minister Emmanuel Macrons.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to “consistent” with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Justice Minister, dropped the sand into a gear in which she appeared at a meeting of abrupt socialist deputies and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "belief in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, forgot the ongoing cemeteries of the socialists and said she could not imagine the new Valls government to be held for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls does not have any, they are forced to form a new government if the old man has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive autumn or winter," Mrs. Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party’s appeal after a parliament’s dissolution and said she was confident to come out as a winner in the predecessor elections and ready for the government.
France’s governing party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-ranged National Front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Sunday found that 76 percent of French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of Holland’s 2017 official period.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment numbers.
“There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third-largest cruise carrier in the world, conducts advanced negotiations to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customer, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced already this week, sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo refused a comment.
Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 percent increase compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, a 6 percent increase compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is $29 billion in total and it is expected for them in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in developing countries such as China and India.
Companies try to position these new customers as the best choice among cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied for the exchange rate to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder of the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino company under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested in 2008 $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares in late June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises share the original application documents for Prestige Cruises’ exchange rate have over 82% of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A peking-treasure group swinged the Chinese flag nearby.
The Permanent Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership elections in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with Beijing faithful members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to elections and cause pro-democracy activists to make their threats and shatter the Hong Kong financial place with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and the party leadership of China fears that the reputation for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Peking White Paper, in which China’s predetermined rule over Hong Kong was presented in June, Democratic activists held an informal referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a seat there.
The questionnaire is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese contact office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Committee of the Permanent Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-Director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned over the course of the day.
Student activists announced to meet in the afternoon before the headquarters office in Hong Kong.
The United Kingdom did not present any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to take "state talks" with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that the Ukrainian government would end the fight against separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "stateness" of the detrimental region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later clarified that Putin did not mean that the territory under the control of separatists in Eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine must be redefinited to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent his rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the government of Kiev to negotiate with the pro-Russian rebels, however, fits with the strategy that he seemed to follow from the beginning of the outbreak five months ago: help for separatists in taking territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossia to take a reality independence with Russia for the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to reinforce the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied area as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term that reminds the pre-revolutionary glance of the Russian Empire.
Putin noted that all those who, during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct 26 and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists, hopefully "arrested in their illusions," Itar-Tass said.
"We must immediately take detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine to preserve the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskow said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, discussed by Kiev's leadership for months to spread fears in Russian-language areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskow said.
“It’s not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia,” Peskow said, “because it’s not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The statement of the Kremlin spokesman on the correction of the "wrong interpretation" of Putin's comments stressed Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, unlike the direct annexation of the Crimea, on which the majority of 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulty attaching the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for the stay in Ukraine.
The autonomy spoken by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments of Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that connects the Russian state with the Crimea.
The peninsula, annexed five months ago in the Black Sea, is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mining, factories and craftsmen who produce important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation, according to new elections, should consider amendments to the Constitution to grant greater control of its finances and the status of languages in the respective territories.
But his idea of autonomy appears to be in a sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and uprising are being argued against Moscow.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eye followed after a further advance of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks had entered the pre-painted region along the Azov Sea in the east of Ukraine.
The Russian-supported separatists took into handstrike, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to attach Mariupol, a harbor of steel industry with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasowsk and close access to the Crimea Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged to take action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are just in front of a point where there is no back,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide any concrete actions, the leadership required the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank colonies and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the settled separatists, Mr. Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers involved in the Russian crash in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian fall screen hunters captured a week ago in Ukraine, Lysenko reported on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal about Australian promises and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey nodded no doubt about hackers who probably stole the naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who Is Who from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of unique pictures of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacking scandal about promises.
The hacker responsible for it may have 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star of the Tribute of Panem and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also claimed to be public private photos due to an iCloud spot.
There are 101 promises on the list.
The most noble who had married Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's contradictory."
All private letters and images should stay private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, said reports from a news site that the hack was "injured" and that the affected were "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with his ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is at the top without a pool.
The films of Palmers include "Love is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative Lawrence said to TMZ, "It is an abstract violation of privacy."
Actress Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: “Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing else than selling hehlerware.”
Pure legally viewed should not be tolerated the spread of stolen images.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderer attended the 8th railroad on the Greater Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Aid for Cancer Children".
The tour, for which one was a torture, was an easy training for the other.
In one, however, they all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski may have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhauses went on the field mountain yesterday with the bike.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat there, particularly because the participation in the 8th railroad on the Greater Feldberg in favour of the Association "Aid for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) also personally brought a valuable understanding.
It's a great thing.
“I know I can do it now – okay!”
Small pockets on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out of...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Oberurseler city parliament, many of the 718 participants grew up at mountains in the early morning and came close to fatigue, but happy at the plateau.
Others, however, were easier to overcome the well eleven kilometers long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessenner, for example.
The Red Green Politician - red dress, red bike - did still something on understatement at the beginning ("Every crowd of professionals, there's the goal!"), but then proved to be a half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also passed the route in a Rutsch, as well as Nina Kuhn, press spokesman of the city Oberursel, who had made the way along with Frank Greenee.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg radeln" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "This is the matter of charity, we are happy with it - we would have made a trip today anyway," Kuhn said.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Ober pneufenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to strap back to the height immediately afterwards.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swore at home at 9 p.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
It was also fun with "Fritten-Toni".
For the boss of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply included.
He had wrapped 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose – that’s what I like to be there,” said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he is an "ambitioned racing wheeler".
He must be that, because he was on his way with the Fixie-Rad, although they are also racing wheels, but without circuit...
That even without a wheel it went lockerly upwards, not only proved to be the 20 walkers who climbed to the top through the white wall and the footstone, but also a jogger who climbed a car tire with weights behind themselves on a cordel.
Bergwacht Doctor Professor Volker Lischke, equipped with his team, with allrad-bully and quad, for safety, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, just that he holds the sliding himself." So he is somewhat his own sliding dog.
The 718 participants – and so many as never before – were sent to the route in the morning in groups.
The hikers are first at 9:30 p.m.
They followed the first cyclists and runners at 10:00 p.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers released.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on the Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice excursion.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the route to Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
