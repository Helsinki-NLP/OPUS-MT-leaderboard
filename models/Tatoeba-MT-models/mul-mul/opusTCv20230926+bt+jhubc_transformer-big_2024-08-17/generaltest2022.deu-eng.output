The goods cost less than €20.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the sales value....
I am #PRS_ORG# wholesale and therefore it's not a problem for me.
Just need a number or instructions that I should add to the package so that it can be pushed as a return.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs €179.
I honestly think that is very upset.
Do I have to cancel and re-order for the best price or is there another option for asset writing?
In principle, I also think that children should not be allowed to take a parental role for their smaller sisters.
However, I think it’s good for big sisters to take care of the little ones too.
Let's take a short look, let's take a short look, let's take a bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children, I don’t see any problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it’s okay for him, that’s good.
You can even determine whether it is suitable for your children.
It’s not so that he’s going to whip K2 and be accompanied for hours as he sleeps.
Pure legally it is probably questionable.
Maybe that’s why the psychologist’s statement also comes.
For if something really should happen, such as fire, collapse, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take, of course, is your criterion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago, and though I still remember almost all the action, I don't want to go through the title anywhere anymore, maybe I know someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal career commits suicide by sucking himself with feeding and walking to his kittens.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation into his therapist, operates a clinic where he treats patients fear.
The Commissioner has a small nephew who also has a fear (of fire) and landed at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is assigned anonymously before each suicide will be ordered to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it finally turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underlying therapy group where the patient is reproduced a chip is suppressed in the brain a center of anxiety and ultimately put patients on the most extreme way of anxiety.
(A woman jumps out of the window another goes with intention to die)
This is called the "fight" in the book.
Finally, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the big act I’m quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this act is known to someone or even someone can betray me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, never, I don't have the password available for Wlan.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take it.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to receive the price difference back?
Child, 4 j., Splitter under the necklace
A child, four years old, has wooden strips under the dust nail (outside).
Haben tried to pull him with a pinzette.
Very difficult to attack.
He did not manage and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chance.
Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote refreshment
Nearly new Omikron cases supply politics and science in the UK.
Until the New Year, all qualified adults in England should receive a vaccine offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to move forward even faster than previously expected in the face of the rapidly rising omicron vaccines.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose until the end of the year, provided that it has passed at least three months since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday night in a pre-registered video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will also provide support to accelerate the vaccine campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The Omicron variants are faced with an emergency, so the vaccine protection needs to be strengthened urgently, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
“Let me boost now!” said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, with the total number increased to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65%. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price when collected?
I am convinced that everyone presents themselves with pronouns.
I sent an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I've googled it, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don’t know how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me, please?
** I am a foreigner and I don’t want to keep any officials on my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine themselves with pronomes.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
The only one I bought today is not
Obviously, the chair had an invisible lack of sales.
How else can a Polster injury occur after 9 months?
Just try #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since about.
14 days no longer.
That is why I always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to your order and pay it to me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content warning: I will write something in detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) came more frequently in contact with the victims (and offenders) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really goes on to me and, unfortunately, too often occurs, is that many victims can’t help or think we couldn’t help them.
I understand that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But in my profession there are fewer things that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation with four eyes, with the offender far apart from sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of leaving the children out of this.
Whatever I want to make clear to everyone, in part, is very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help myself in any case... I know I can't.
This will never make it easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence that is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series look like "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball League: Derby-Debacle of the MHP giant Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was leaving.
Nothing again: For the second time within three months not even lost the giants in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick, looking back at the pokal retreat at the early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, said, "We still have a bit of anger in our stomach."
However, after the game, it has not laid itself - but again increased in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) -report in the Basketball Federation League.
Even more than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
Deputy is called a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: the three-quote was just 13 percent once, 4 hits (together by young John Patrick) at saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer gave John Patrick: “We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and have not implemented what we have trained.”
I mean, moving the ball.
He responded to Sebastian Gleim: “To win a good game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” the lucky coach said.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised again.
While in Patrick's team itself, performance carriers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and dropped up to eight points after they had already relocated 39:59.
Justin Simon, along with John Patrick, came to 12 points.
Fortunately, a lot of time isn’t going to stay.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg up to 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again.
We initially reported a half year ago.
Just like the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He is able to enthusiastize his audience with new interpretations of shells from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he can happen.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there will be nothing from it.
The planned concert was relocated in May 2022 - "on official instructions" to invade the Corona virus.
Other of his events planned in the advent time have to be seen only once, as it is called on the songwriter's website, who is now 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
As of January, the artists will then recover their dates already posted in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the northern Rhine-Western Lünen, Max Raabe has been very happy to sing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied Operngesang, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra with communitons.
Since then, the bariton has established itself with its repertoire of shelves and songs in the style of comedian harmonists.
He was awarded many times with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his success album "For Women is not a problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly backwards and labeled, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought of from the current German-language music landscape.
With the program "Hello, dear Lucky" he's on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small piece of furniture pattern in advance?
It is supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it fits color
It still doesn't work, but I can't just plan to leave the sheet.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by extortion
The new federal construction minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the cancellation of large housing companies, as it has been requested in a public decision in Berlin.
"With a cancellation there is no new apartment, only the owner's structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to ensure that their rentals will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private renters, joint ventures or housing companies is, for example, the best protection against monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert committee on how to deal with the result of the folk decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not close talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further worsening in lease law.
The coalition contract provides for a lease price brake by 2029, a limitation of lease increases in stressed housing markets and the expansion of lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the lease market is not relaxed yet, “we will talk to coalition partners about further steps,” the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.

This is an absolute freak
At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
With a devastating storm system, numerous tournaments have been drawn through the United States.
Only in Kentucky could be complaining about more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there resemble a war zone.
In the U.S. on Saturday night, several tornados have caused severe destruction and possibly required up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a cutting of about 320 kilometers long of the destruction, especially in the Kentucky Member State.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere the tournado was passed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He is alone in Kentucky with up to a hundred deaths, official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she was sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very sad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it taken out of the range?
Is there a possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
How long do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, only can I order the ceiling now and deliver to Germany which is in the basket?
I had returned an article or refund through the contact form and wanted to ask if it was arrived or edited because I haven’t received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertisements
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine prize, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money prizes for vaccination.
This means that they are on a line with the social partners and the economic chambers, which today require financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the redesign of advertising logs to call for vaccines - according to German example - will increase the readiness to corona vaccines.
He's moved to a company he's worried about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not fix himself in his old place, and he sought something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at that time, no matter what.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.

Good day - I'm interested in the Boone Dining table, white.
Is it in size 230cm?
We run all Smeg kitchen appliances and the appropriate accessories in our online shop kitchenpoint.de.
We will basically check the quality and completeness of your order.
Smeg’s new coffee machine brings freshly cooked coffee into your kitchen or office.
The sharp and reduced design, the plastic surface in matte colors combined with the matte-built stainless steel front, makes the new SMEG coffee filling machines with milk seamers a design object.
According to the reduced design, all functions such as meal degree and water quantity can be selected, as well as the choice between Espresso, Americano, Ristretto or a mild coffee with only four buttons.
Thanks to the dam plant, coffee milk and dairy foam specialities can also be prepared.
Help in the first of your own campaign
Boron to the cave!
I’m just heading for a group of 4 friends the adventure Over the Greifen Pass and I want my heroes to lead to a campaign that is specially written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big ark is made, the evilness and its motivations, invented the individual acts, and now I am about to write the start-up seeds and prouder already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a ferry with grain from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Lake.
That is where the further action will develop.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are intended to raise a group of Goblins and draw them into a backdrop.
I would like to give players the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threats, identifying the danger early, no matter what happens to the players.
Group thickness: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bowls and peppers armed
When noted, the Goblins lift up the heroes in a hollow way and flank up to three to the left, and to the right of me bowls armed the railroad, while two with spears stop the railroad.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and consequently healed by the son of the village school, a half, and healed.
The car is gone, of course.
2 If a defeat should be invariably caught by this half with two of his servants and come to the heroes in battle to help.
The car is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't counted with so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will safeguard many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narratives.
I rebuild the lamp.
And again stitched together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send them back.
If you can then let the tickets come back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm genered by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has been increasingly down during the season, so I want to make myself a bit of air with this post.
For the first time in the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted today in order to start the F1 pre-reportation in time.
Although the delayed start and start crash of the schedule was far behind the planning, you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
However, it appears that for legal reasons the F1 has priorities and therefore has to limit everything else, so Sky DE may have had no choice here.
However, it's stupid because Sky UK has finished the race.
However, a little praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has well accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident.
In the F1 there was once again irregular knowledge of commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you should change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tyres when there were appropriate radio requirements on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for intelligence.
I believe that such elementary rules should simply be known when you comment on the F1 on a pay TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first mystery advice, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both of which simply have constant uncertainty in the subject rules.
In general, it doesn’t like Roos’s artificial commentary style, but it’s a taste.
But I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
There are constant recordings that make both seem simplely unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (especially unintelligent) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter brings a lot of anxiety into the comment, which he does not seem to take seriously.
Lastly, the advertisement simply overcomes at Sky, in which the outlet run is Sky the only broadcaster to go to the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV because only the German tons track without comments has to come out immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do so.
Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising in the exercises than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasts.
Although Glock and Tree Gardeners must be praised for their work, this alone does not allow me to look at the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 program is also very likely and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language transmitter that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job in the four races that they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pencil lamp, copper and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday she will check and send an email and she has never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12 December.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the fabric has a hole on the front of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Air pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the plants.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect more outputs.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model of the ventilator pump, it is also offered to put an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air belt (below us in the shop) or with a decor that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
There would be a treasure truck to call mosquito or something like that.
The MK series has a special, noise-contained design and thus provides low operating noises.
The installation is very easy.
The ventilator pump is connected to an outflower, etc., through a 4/6 mm ventilator, and it can already go away.
The ventilation pump should be equal, or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the ventilator pump is deeper than the water level, a reservoir valve should be placed between it.
Simply cut the air screw and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards, running water from the pool through the pump.
If the air pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we indicate the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, then the packages are packaged daily and the packages are collected here daily.
If everything is going well on the way, it's going very fast.
We just want to avoid a little so that no one will be voted, just because it once took a little longer.
It would be that, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who work in the field of transportation...of course, there is no corona here.
Please do not evaluate as badly, only because the delivery is delayed, which is solely due to the package services.
Of course, you like to shit on these services, even if we say right now...that's fucking hard
This is also regionally very different.
Don’t be bad to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without bracelet?
Can you also order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into the universe
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four more passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the New Shepard rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the United States of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos was the highest person to receive the freshly curved astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue space dress when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, six passengers climbed on and on and out to the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of 1961 as a NASA astronaut, Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the Blue Origin rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan was honored by the company, who had four other passengers paid for their tickets: Lamer-Astronaut Dylan Taylor, Evans's son Investor.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father’s mission after the short flight.
He has worked hard on his efforts and has to do everything himself.
She just flew that way, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed enthusiasm.
He would like to come back to everything right away, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flys up to 100 kilometers high
The missile system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the missile during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers over the earth, temporarily with gravity before the reuseable object was rebound from large fall screens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers over the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-time trip from Blue Origin: In July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, Canada’s 90-year-old actress William Shatner became world-famous for his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to promote space tourism business largely without scientific research interests in the welfare of humanity and without taking into account the climate.

Anyone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the expertise in fact quite exciting, and even in the laboratory does not bother me (there is already an inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I also informed myself about professional prospects before studying, but I also thought at the time that I decided to study and be until the promotion.
But at the moment, I have doubts, particularly suppressing my professional perspectives.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) you repeatedly hear super professional opportunities and the profession is totally searched, on the other hand you repeatedly hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really be interested in:
1) What are you doing right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it again?
Thank you for your answers!
I’m currently really uncertain and I’m thinking about breaking the study in 2022 and making a training for a professional formatter.
If you have experiences, write them again :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This issue came to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only a knife for it.
Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
It seems that there are the holidays as well as the bridge days before.
This was the way: last week, Marié was Heavenly journey, which is called "Upfahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day that is semi-official.
Last week it was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what went last week?
Everywhere stress.
All e-mails that must be out before departure, order here, all *inconditionally* before the long weekend.
Because... and because?
Because " next week then" sounds so long and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to take all seriously as much in a short week as in a normal?
I was not only stressed on Wednesday, but I was also powerful.
What is this self-reconciliation for holidays?
Why do we have any holidays if we can’t give them right?
The stress didn’t come well from above, the colleagues were all so independent.
My question is, are we the only Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thüring home - but still has no gifts.
"It's beautiful, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, then you just go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the feast by backing and bassling with her son’s places.
“I love that,” said Catterfeld.
But until the day of thinking, she has a little to do: “For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to finally let go now.”
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of mouse and federation re-education.
NEKTON Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and brilliant feather.
Most of the harms in the birds are due exclusively to dietary errors.
Since the fever consists of a protein-containing substance, for the formation of an inappropriate fever dress, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the losses of animals that occur during the mouse are based on lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feeds is expressly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or via soft feed.
Thank you, I found it

DDR Handwork Model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, which was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare Lok is probably derived from the rebuilding proposal of the model railroad ME Heft 11/1968, used with heavy tracks and defects SCHREEN SCHREEN SCHREEN SCHREEN SCHREEN SCHREEN SCHREEN
A locomotive is located in DB Museum Halle (Sale) and we operate
The German Reichsbahn Company had ordered the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electrical lokomotive that should be able to carry 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed on this route.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Lokomotive with a damp storage drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, which Siemens chockers with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928 the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as a repair property.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn improvement work Dessau, the reconstructionworthiness of all six locomotives was established.
[4] When there was a growing need for locomotives for heavy freight transportation, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, while the other machines served as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 in larger numbers were preferably constructed.
Only when the E 94 predicted that the recycling number could not be increased further, the E 95 turned to the point of view of the recycling.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the railway station Leipzig-Wahren.
They came to Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own circuit plan mainly before coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problemically, with increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be.
So it often occurred that shields remained in shielding operations.
Then the Beimann with Hammer and Wooden Keil, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to resolve the shield during the journey.
Damage to the motors occurred more often and led to months of failure in the locomotive.
[5] Since in the late 1960s there were sufficient newly built-in commodities and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could abandon old locomotives and most split gates, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric motors only one-way, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties mentioned in the machinery and the visual conditions of the driving station.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dismissed in the middle of 1969, they followed the E 95 01, which dismissed the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 has never been used.
All locomotives were broken down until E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was placed as a substitute for the future museum lokomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating facility at the main station Halle.
It took some time to be convinced by the managers at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 is worthwhile as a museum lokomotive.
In 1979, the outer processing of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it to a vehicle view at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Museum of Transport as a non-operative museum lokomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotives took place.
The locomotive museum is located in the DB Museum Halle (Sale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational processing of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was first introduced to an exhibition at the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external lacking, with the transformers being checked and five driver engines being operated.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schleswig Mountains and the two-way sideways, where they proved to be due to their reliable drive and low maintenance burden.
In February 1945, the machines were resettled to Leipzig as a medium German network.
The main area of use was first Slavia.
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, it is necessary for optical reworking at the lock in self-working, initiated, with play tracks, keller smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small editing- possibly the construction set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN

I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet..they are too narrow and the bars cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The medium bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The medium bar does not fit into the intended maintenance.
So I get new sent.
When will they be dismissed?
No, no flats.
These are, according to the installation manual the right of the shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing they achieve their purpose
They're not flat with me
Could I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, do I want to explain the problem again?
Home fire with two lightweight injured and high damage
Two people have been mildly injured in a fire in a residential house in Oberbayern.
In addition, a estimated damage in the six-digital euro area was occurring, police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoking poisoning.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not come out of a planned fire.
The Kripo Prinstenfeldbruck has taken the further investigations.
But it comes a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
For fake news - Biontech-CEO releases Vaccine Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech Chief Uğur Shahin had not yet expressed publicly his vaccine status.
Now the entrepreneur released a photo showing his corona vaccine.
The disease of a friend moved him to it, Shahin told him.
CEO and co-founder of Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he gets a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine,” Shahin wrote on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me in which I will be vaccinated to counter these false rumours."
So far, he has rejected this because communication shouldn’t turn around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old schoolfriend from me is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting a severe COVID-19 disease and is hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"But the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and misconfidence."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the German Wave circulates on the Internet, where Uğur Shahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video emerged in December 2020, as the German Wave itself clarified.
"I am currently not permitted by law to get the vaccine myself," Shahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in vaccination.
At the same time, the priority has long been cancelled - and the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate data.
Fire in Removal: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westfalen, the light went out on Friday night: no electricity anymore, and in many cases there is probably no heating.
A fire had burned a relaxation station.
After a fire with severe damage in a relief station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Westfalen winning ice in North Rhine-Westfalen had to leave without electricity for about 24 hours.
Through the fire, 41,000 people and women affected in several municipalities went out of the lights on Friday night.
The Westnet provider reported that many emergency current aggregates had been in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disturbance could finally be repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and assistants and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities called for care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the uncomfortable use,” said Florian Witt, head of primary technology, in a statement on Saturday night.
The repair of the damage will be used for a few days, as the Western network assemblyers could initially only take some directions temporarily back in operation, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company data.
Electricity flows back
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has severely damaged the parts of the 10,000-volt cooling plant in the respanning station, according to Westnet.
There is a need for cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 18:00, more than 21,000 people have had electricity in Much and Ruppichteroth.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually suspended from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last electricity has been affected by the failure.
More than 80 Western networks and partner companies have been employed.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of older or lonely people in their neighbourhood and inform the local firefighting houses when assistance is needed," said the Land Council Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency aggregates, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were primarily focused.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary school care sites were established for those who could not take care of themselves or need current-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good morning!
The ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay it in euro?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA5>
But I can't assemble this undergestell on the table plate.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are three versions.
We wanted those with table plate diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't move them together and thus shorten them.
Can you continue to help me?
Otherwise, I have to send them back because they are otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would be delighted to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
So let's do it!
Can you send me the return card by e-mail?
The repair is now completed.
I tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I think that low assets are almost unshaken.
We do not agree with this

Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both have made s new and use version 4.5...
It may be that you have heard of the problem more often.
I have a book purchased with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be incorrectly registered with customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?

I also have to work in the meantime!
In order to become uniform and clean, clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before putting the pinsel on a new model for the first time, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 strips.
You can do this on the no longer visible inside of the components later or on a yogurt cup.
The first strip on the component
Draw the pinsel equally stretch next to stretch.
Light coating of color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid washing quickly with the pinsel.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark may appear later.
Metal tones and metal colors come to an end with a separate pinsel.
Otherwise, it can occur to unpleasant metal screws when mixing with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you surprise them.
The models reach the original look through the decals or decay images.
From landmarks on aircraft to ship names and car model marks: The Decals give the model the last slide.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still good to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be lifted or lighter before it is mounted into the bumps.
Even more important than the right tool such as screws, pinzettes and toothbrushes are when heating time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out every decal required individually and put it right to you.
Decals are also called water sharp images, because you are moisturizing their back shortly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the nose.
Then you just push the image a small piece of paper and put the piece to the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moisturized before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper on the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting right before you screw it completely from the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, knitt it, or even stir it up.
Wash excess water with a household piece.
Respect is not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly, as soon as I look at something else, then I don’t read the book anymore and I have to log in and reload the book and search the place to where I read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Can I get it by email?
Also for all three packages?
The lamp came with me in three separate packages.
Thank you very much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Children's wish treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in child desire treatment for some time, now that it is about the bill with the PKV, this suddenly spreads.
The row after:
We had applied for the childhood pathway in advance at the PKV and received the commitment over 3 attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they still did not expect the PKV.
We once again applied for the cost resuming at the PKV and received another 3 attempts.
After a few further experiments (we have performed more experiments than promised, logically calculating the most expensive with the PKV) we made the bills in the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 experiments (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 experiments.
The reason: With pregnancy/begottenness, the remaining 2 attempts of the first pledge fall.
The second child’s wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the insurance case begins with healing treatment, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to refund the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have to point us out in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (conditionally by closed eagerness) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here gave your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can get them the best again?
All right.
We will not order any more with them.
If you add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they are obviously lost a good customer.
They would like to move it to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the refund was caused, and now you tell me that I only have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can get the commodity completely disturbed with me.
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It is clear and clear that the refund has been caused and I still haven't received any refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you now have lost two tribal customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise, they should not sell him as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I will remove the wardrobe and be able to make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be promoted with additional hockers to buy, but we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget movie is exactly, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has what to say:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film*** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as at Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What do you think about it?
And maybe what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer from you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again now, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you need to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I will soon regain it because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
Halber victory against Belarus linked with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and were massive infringements of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This difficulty - Belarus does not contribute very smallly, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going further for a while.
The handling of people on the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
It is apparent that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to oppose it, it goes at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"They are apparently unable to implement when a Member State is in mind to do its thing," such as Poland currently, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU paid another prize for its policy at the border with Belarus, Bossong: a principle initiation of asylum policy will be harder since the line " border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewable attempt of crossing the border
According to Polish border protection, migrants have tried again to reach Belarus to Poland.
55 Migrants were arrested at night on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
Polish officials were prosecuted by migrants with stones in Czeremsza in the incident.
According to the report, a soldier was encountered in the face and had to be taken care of by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday night, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border locks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko as a power holder in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania ruled press releases from border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, the EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to stop their trips there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the wages and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh banners and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic policy costs.
The Belarusian society is not sure that the security apparatus will regularly climb thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes protests for a contested Formula 1 final
Max Verstappen is supposed to have committed two rules breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed a complaint.
The silver pillars suspected two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged infringement of Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last safety car phase, as he is supposed to have overcome irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the evaluation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not complying with the rules.
Verstappen had yet to be overwhelmed in the last round Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes and had reached his first Formula 1 title.
The manufacturing took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Netherlands had overcome a car running before it.
I'll check it.
I'll talk to the bank and tell you again.
Thank you for the support

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the lecture series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann on Friday released Blue Note from her current novel "Home" and served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and sounds sensitive to the night sounds at her house door.
I gave up the contact form for the return of an article yesterday, but I did not receive an email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request was filed.
It doesn't all have the time for your paid chat and incorrectly delivered cheap software from China.

It's like a dealer says he has nothing against foreigners.
I won't admit it both.

For me, God has put all things in place.
But once you are a creator, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science only captures foolishness.
And so you're a science enemy and don't take more seriously like a colleague.
In order to maintain an optimal view field, the wolf should be closer to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-aromatic lens system allows you to use the lupe without sealing and color errors until the edge zone.
Often, wolves are characterized with enlargement data.
However, this information applies only to precisely defined conditions that rarely comply with the conditions of use.
To optimise your lump, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, so also in the case of intrusions, light reflections occur.
Through an anti-reflective coating, these mirrors are significantly reduced.
In keeping with the optimal conditions of use - the hole close to the eye - mirrors on the lenses are less noticeable.
For more information, see the related user manual (in German and English).

Dance sale in Schönwolde: Women in the Krembz municipality looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced a lot of curiosity at the time of the sale.
One time, a man would even have gone home without his partner because both couldn’t agree.
Every year he plants about 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced a lot of situations.
This is always a bit funny, he says.
What about the coupon??
Otherwise, I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is gripped in one spinning spider.
They both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be just like the "Dreher", which is not so delicious at all.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connector and I used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted up to a few failures perfectly 50 Mbit.
The new fiber fiber connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also comes to it.
However, on the other DLan module that broadcasts the wifi, the more the full 500, but the further I remove in the house with the module, the less it comes (so use a connector that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber connection is now even slower than before on the first floor (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set that apparently used a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar large losses here as well.
Can anyone explain why with glass fiber so much internet speed over the power line "loss"?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely excited to use in the house LAN cable still.
I’m really desperate, so I’ve created an extra account here.
That’s why I would be happy with a response.
When is the time to change the Giro Account
Anyone who thought he would be silent for the first time with the gyroconans would be disappointed.
While many banks have used autumn in order to reaffirm their customers with all the tricks of confirming the increases in fees in the past, the free amounts for negative interest continue to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of €100,000 long.
Now she has just cut the free amount and even cut for a day’s money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group’s Postbank – to 50,000 euros at Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros per day cash accounts.
However, these lower free amounts are considered for the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still applicable, just as with the ING Germany.
The most popular direct bank DKB has reduced the free amounts to two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of €25,000 or less, according to numbers of the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank of Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even been entitled to this rule before the Berlin Land Court.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutes may be supposed to form reserves - in the case that the above instances also declare the negative interest rates in principle unacceptable and have to be refunded to many millions of bank customers.
The table plate was delivered for 8 people instead of that for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston occupies a whole beauty army
She is officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their lives are like mountains and valleys.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected to be the most influential wife of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For those who did 2021 with the "Friends" replay event and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and coaches takes care of her appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she gives herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the chest).
It’s really a miracle that you get the hearts of female and male fans.
Maybe because she's just getting lucky - and still looking for great love.
And the baby's wish has been deleted from the list.
She was always asked when she would become a mother.
That's what she painted.
The people who asked this have no idea what happened to me personally, medical why I can't.
It was really injury.
Hopefully, success and reputation will also make you happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Raiking Needs to Leave
Kimi Riikkönen's goodbye from Formula 1 was even more quiet than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out his gloves and wiped out the sweat from the front.
That was it.
After a driving failure and a light band touch, the rickkoen had to stop the Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix from Abu Dhabi after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the motorsport royal class.
For a goodbye, his wife Minttu and the two children were traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
Riikkönen’s biggest success was the win of the 2007 World Cup at Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the twoerbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bob Pilot.
"I have calculated this time, I had to get nine and a half win per season, and then I could get it up to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
Only on Saturday he defeated the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundred stells, in which he went from rank three to one.
He then changed somewhat in the material setting and performed a bigger precursor on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
Thirdly, he became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We’ve made a greater risk today and have been rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22th victory in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came to place two earlier this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in rank four in the first race eight.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do that too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
In the women, Laura Nolte took the third seasonal victory in the two-bob on her homes.
After it was only for the fourth place in the Monob on Sunday, she grew to the World Cup at the German triple success with anchor Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-bob Olympic winner Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came to rank second with Germany's fastest sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podest square alongside her Olympic qualification this winter.
The Wisbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on third place.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me with.
I'm super cool with development.
There’s still a lot of potential at the start, but the start time was okay today,” Burghardt said and emphasized, “It’s not just anxiety, but there’s also a lot to do there too.”
Jamanka was a little angry about the uncommon journeys, but he said, “It’s going in the right direction.”
I had the ceiling in the basket and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I haven’t received it, and therefore I haven’t been able to rescue it, so I have finally asked for it.
By Corona last year I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now he thought it was gone, which made me very angry.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare sitting bank.
I want to give it back and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why does the shipment start only at 16.3?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I'm on the tip comes an extra field with the message
He was taken away from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered weather.
But we want the regal module, however, a new harmless
And not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it's one - or others so...
I am 24 years old, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - once except that my dog is not crying or going into the childhood is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) has been sick, a 2nd grade burning has been achieved on Monday and is depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him in the shower (because hand is in the union because of burning).
He’s cooled above and we’re currently seeing us less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to create with my needs of enthusiasm and love.
My dog girl has just stomach, I've cooked for him and now he's in his kissing cover and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and stripped for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it’s just gone for a month.
There is still a homework on us, which we, of course, share.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just quite well adjusted, I'm halfway well treated and get right.
Not good, but I get right and I’m almost symptomatic.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15:00 I have made a written test for which I have done nothing yet and overmorrow anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral examination on Tuesday, and what happens then is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room anymore.
So my week goes like this: only until overmorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, is it all going on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And that is how it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed that I need these mental points because otherwise I’m packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't do it...
Do you think that's the same?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful for not having to work.
Very infinite grateful, I can't even say that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this also has partly something to do with mental loading of women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'll find some suffering companions here...
I would like to wish you a restful night, the week has almost done!
I have got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is craved and table bone has print.
At the first delivery, the color was just like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer to me?
If we are going to exchange the table now I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she was not confirmed.
I found at the time at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that for them it is just another subject like mathematics or science.
For me it was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian, and I always believed that way.
How are you doing this?
You may also be able to talk about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physicist who doesn’t believe in the relativity theory.
What does it mean to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Real culture or something like that?
Hopefully your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed, can't it?I like to write English, too.
It's been a long time, then I'd be away from it
It's okay, thank you.
I am expecting a feedback at the time by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for movie help please
Hello, dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (b 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film, there are two sides (or parallel worlds).
The modern (real world).
In other words, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) is not entirely certain.
Because I can't describe it more closely in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the roads cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live by myself, I think.
The transition is also the cemetery of the soldier.
In the end, both soldiers fight each other.
If you say something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little boy slept on the stomach from week 1 only.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
A child like that looks much more out of it than you think.
Make sure that everything is right there, no kiss, often go in and look, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good matrix.
No kisses.
Axso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a ceiling.
Watch your child as he sleeps.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can it rise from the stomach?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can find out if everything is okay.
We’ve all grown up, and when my husband came to the world, it’s been going and we’d like to put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we've already been "Stamm Client" with you and have already bought a lot of items
Why do you only offer me $20?
Hello, I have written with a colleague yesterday and haven't received any comments so far.
It's about my dressing cabinet that arrived yesterday (bed number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right blade does not fit into the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is not used so right now.
To make it clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is just so that the policy of this transmitter is now under all sau.
Almost every format is sponsored (OK), but then still at the same time go to a large bed tour.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Citat Arno: You want to "not be a ongoing lithous column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don's.
They are, of course, applicable to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can, of course, continue to insult people.
A Krogman who is completely missing empathy and tries to make an ash at the expense of the leased spaces at the expense of the action.
How do you find it all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's awful.
I ask for a call because my delivered wooden table was defected.
Body break through damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a cheerleader in the stomach or just to kiss – my small heat friend is widely used.
Kirschkern boxes are a traditional home remedy for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkern cores can absorb very well heat and re-dosed.
The removable indoor pocket can be heated easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they don’t even go so well.
The Kirschkern box with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Before heating the kissing, check on untypical smells, stack or fire spots and remove immediately in case of presence.
Please take out the inner pocket for heating in advance from the reference!
Heat in the microwave at up to 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (recognize the data of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat uniformly in the coat!
Then return the inner pocket to the reference.
The first heatings can cause light moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to keep up with the indicated heating warnings as longer periods or higher energy performance may cause damage (inflammatory and combustion risk!).
Before heating the box in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pocket has been returned to the reference, please check the temperature of the pocket suitable for babies (max 43 °C) at your bracelet!
Do not use the bowl in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feveral diseases, circular disorders, fresh haematomes, blood vessels and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor prior to use.
If nails have opened and lost cores, remove the product and the lost cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child during application should be regularly controlled to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents relating to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Football League.
This is why Hannover 96 works out of the table shelter.
Ingolstadt does not run under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Error display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite installed power supply.
Then I built up the battery, but there’s nothing here too.
Do you want ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design, there is no problem!
20 liters of version capabilities also cover larger photo equipment without any problems that can be safely understood using the polished FlexFold parts.
And what you are still in need of everyday items, thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior, it remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that can safely protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: once conventionally through the cover valve, which can be closed with the MagLatch lock system, an excellently thoughtful solution for effective protection that has already proven to be at the Messenger bags.
In the locking valve there is a locking hack of metal with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fulfilment conditions" in this regard: there are 4 anchor bars, stable destruction in which the locking bars can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully charged, just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Valve lock and hacks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be securely closed without crashing the hacks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from others, photo bags: besides the cover valve there is still a strap opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to want to be content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the day-to-day suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus easily separated both from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side of the body to access the camera equipment in the right corner, while the everyday things remain safe in the left backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, incomplete adjustable wear juices help you.
And since the outer bag is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is intended to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I’m not going to wait for the email from your support.
#NAME# gave me an email from confirmation to confirm the
Contact contact was announced by the expedition to collect the wrong-supplied table.
So far, I haven't received any message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I came beyond the promise that I received an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#
It is expected when the wardrobe can be delivered back?
Keeping him like that is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you another nice evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp when I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I'll give up a bigger order, but anyway, I've kept the damaged furniture and not sent back.
And that last year differently than expected, I couldn’t understand and just couldn’t clarify it at a time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don’t accept it.
Roting brake discs are designed to appreciate the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the brake even under difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made of guss and then mechanically processed (bound and cut).
All tender discs are made in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are own for specific discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which aims to expand the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The so-called discs ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuttings improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake frames.
The aesthetic characteristics of our embroidered discs highlight the characteristic of each car’s attractive and impressive appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event characterized the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright broken in the water at the southern gable of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and solved the so-called ‘California Gold Rush’ of ‘49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, tents were covered, and salons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott).
In this game, you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You need to overcome your pioneer colleagues in order not to leave with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, have to stay home with your resources and create a table that is more and more "working" for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions or apply rules to your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual gaming style with fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California acquired official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While each round, the players will choose a location at the same time on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Then their selection will be discovered and they will place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has most pioneers, it gets a block!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing possible actions there.
Then players perform alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting tents, browsing rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awarder turns at the beginning of each round into a new location, transforming the available promotions.
This continues until the awarder has moved five times, so each location has hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting where the players must defend Coloma from an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have controlled enough revolts and are numberally superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the funeral.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final assessment takes place.
The player wins most of the scores!

"Why Children Are Not Tyranny" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I just looked at it.
>Children psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a visitor to talk show and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Be Tyranns" (2008), he resolved a harsh educational debate.
Ex-painting:Insiders and educators now raise severe charges against him.
Please be careful that the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people today think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible should never, never, take power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and make the frame for the child as large as it is in the situation as meaningful and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shit.
Holetchek: Countries advised on the elimination of testing obligation for three-time vaccinated
The country’s health ministers want to decide at their next meeting on a federal removal of testing obligation for three times vaccinated.
"We need countries quickly clear whether and when the test obligation can be fulfilled for three vaccines," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers Conference, the "Bild on Sunday".
The elimination of 2G plus for three-time vaccines is “not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine stimulus,” Holetchek said.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has said that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministers conference on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I get the best done?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't deal with my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Ups, there is an error.
Buying through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account data.
Where can this be?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sensual perceptions under full narcotics.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most commonly, it comes to hearing noises / voices, rarely seeing pictures, and most rarely seeing pain.
For this topic relevant: Emperor cuts are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very profound narcosis is avoided to protect the child until decay.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the drug adjudication.
Certain anaesthesia processes such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) coincide with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love everyone, although this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, he had **u/Nitemarex **per definition.
I’ve read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 doesn’t help us, too.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they would take back the defect chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they take back the defective chair at least.
We sell the second chair then privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email you didn't answer.
Again the question.
In the order and in the bill, the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipment is a company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were only delivering in front of the house door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don’t know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to me on the first floor.
Don't you call me?
I had a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental theatre story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, printing fresh: "A old man gets older".
The shocking diarium of a slow goodbye from the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the news is that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book is, "I have already testified to my life thanks."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common ones is European pallets, standard wood pallets, which are mostly used in European space as charging carriers.
You are certified by the European Palette Association EPAL
In 2020, more than 10 million palettes were produced in Austria according to statistics.
The production value was about 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be raised
New York will first win the MLS championship
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After 1:1 in the regular gametime against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided to shoot the final in the elfmeter with 4:2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had played against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Loading Tips & Tricks
I had many great tips here a week ago for the perfect golash.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
Thank you again for it :)
Now I've come to the taste and I'd like to cook for the first time at Silvester.
Tomorrow I'm going to hire a cow fund for that.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a oven, but just a big towel.
How's it going now?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on 18.01. by email that the refund was made.
But so far, the money hasn’t come in with me.
Please check out here.
Where there are Christmas bars in the room Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente are part of Christmas Days such as dance tree and gifts.
You haven't worried about birds yet?
Now the time is short.
We'll tell you where you've got a Christmas bar in the room Lübeck yet.
The "Drive" of a pipe end level significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor Circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME regulator, you can set the desired pegel and the volume content of your sounds on the one hand.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator that allows you to reduce the noise level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
The POWER LEVEL Regular may even make a power reserve if it is unshamed.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal herein is, in fact, processed with a box simulation, so that you will receive an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or in direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX books so that you can hit your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate mood device.
In addition to spending a VFS5 foot button, the sounds can also be sounded by foot, turn on/off the power blocks and "tape" the pace of the then-compatible effects.
This is essential for live intervention.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step in the future!
Have you seen that with others?
Do you have a chance to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low over a dining table?
So I would like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commodity?
Will we receive an update for the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, you've been sitting on #PRS_ORG# chairs
If not, I would be happy with a discount or coupon too.
Perhaps I find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods I don’t need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Mirror (door) on the intended hacks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status for you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the restoration of the international nuclear agreement have been developed according to Iran's statements.
"The two sides are shortly before agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's Chief Trader Ali Bagheri said on Sunday at the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", since at first there was no unity on the topics to be negotiated.
The deal will prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna’s negotiations on the renewal of the agreement were continued after almost a week’s interruption.
The negotiations take place by traders of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia.
A U.S. delegation is also in place in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen obsoletes Saxony - Free State now Federal with the highest Corona Incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxons and currently has the highest incidence across the union.
As the only federal country, the value is above the brand of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thüringen was located at the Corona incident on Sunday over the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Sachsen, which last had always shown the highest incidence across the union, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incident in Thüringen had decreased slightly, but also had been above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severe Covid-19 diseases were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, reporting may be delayed.
In addition, healthcare officers have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly later with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I need to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post, was it?
Do I have to click/in/fill any more here?
That's what I want to avoid, that's why I write to you.
I would like to take the return at my own expense.
8 euros refund fee is a shit in my eyes.
It's time to change
###MBundest is welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why the post here?
When you look at the activity in the last months of the month of the month, you can find one: it is not existence.
We came to a winter star and expanded the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it?
Mostly, this might simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have ended here and how we generally represent.
In the last few days, the impression has been increased that many here really have bock on the MBundest Day.
#What We Need to Change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag who wants to keep it alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has been aware of this project in the last days and has found, simply saying, screws.
After some in- and rewriting, several people from the community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone to participate again, but only that is how this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server where we can exchange each other, as well as elaborate concrete things.
You can sign up to the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundestage work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be modified / customized / removed?
* How are we going to come out in the future?
* How should new members be nominated?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not bad, we’ve finally got the discord.
If you have a desire and time, come to the discord, work with and let’s democratically decide on the future.
I ordered a lamp screen with you that will still be delivered.
Now I think the item is too big/cloud for it and is not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered another suspension with you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in excess size, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the wrong cabinet is picked up in time.
And I beg you to arrange now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I'll disassemble the wardrobe as far as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time in order to agree on a retreat date.
Is there a manual for assembly?
How long do I have to take care of it or choose to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived vegetarianly for a while, now she eats meat very rarely.
I was also a vegetarian for a few years.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thinking.
And that I long thought I would support the animal preference as a vegetarian, but I once thought and understood that I finally supported animal preference.
That’s why my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that it was disgusting on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knew where her meat came from and she was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly wrapped into a corner and conflicts arose without making it possible.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
Clearly, this is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# should not be unconnected from the legal requirements to the remote.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not collect my returns on site.
Because I can’t be on site because of a funeral, this can’t be changed.
Can I have an alternative withdrawal time?

Lahnsteiner Wear for water rescue equipped: €45,000 land subsidies
Recently, the Rheinland-Pfalz Interior Minister Roger Lewentz, in Lahnsteiner Rathaus, issued an appendix of €45,000 for the new water rescue of the Volunteer Firewehr Lahnstein, to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here,” says Lahnstein’s Mayor Peter Labonte.
The truck is used by the lahnstein buffer staff, one of seven units in Rhineland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice relief as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein you are constantly anticipated with increasing efforts: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel as well as the increasing use of the lahn as a free time stream contributes to it.
I bought a book that I could only read about 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
Bin followed their recommendations, however, has synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NICHTS has worked.
I’m a little disappointed because the whole action has been taking me a lot of time and I hope to help.
Okay, then it's so.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?
According to ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously identified values in the Fenix Laboratory are determined at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

For the first time, thank you for putting the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we were also armed in the executive, I don't want to go on!
I always think the question of right and left is very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that of course the minister comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in special uniform and weaponry people right of conservative magic should also be clear to everybody, that these people can then be difficult to deal with living reality, of course also, because you have, of course, a white apart from the average, because now many Germans with migration background, women, and less you don't have to save them, and I mean, they don't even have to take this overwhelming woman.
But also these border groups are represented by my experience for the first time as strange as a conservative attitude, saying they are proud of Germany and feel less overwhelmed by over-left policy, even if this policy is likely to have to make it right for them, they simply want to be treated completely normally.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, there will also be extreme rights that they can openly say their opinion there, or even openly smuggling any state-threatening plans is medially completely overwhelmed and irritate me too.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign use often began to break down due to negative experiences and sometimes things say controversial to politically incorrect.
It also occurs that there will be also a time when true companions who are taking a rainy exchange of thoughts will meet.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, this is well-fighted and also counteracted with political education and intelligence to all!
Germany is so devastated internationally, and it is so good in my opinion that we couldn’t have the right racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don’t understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it was not sold.
I ordered it in November.
This was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order that is no longer available.
I've seen #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# Cart for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this cart is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But on the edge of the wooden part there are two deep curves filled with something yellow.

Ordinary by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I’m very disciplined and organized at work (being independent, very little leisure time), but I’ve been getting it more bad for my life than just to lead my household permanently clean and regularly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when and when it packs me and I clean up and kiss.
But it’s never so “that someone could ever come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is not even better, although it disturbs me somewhere but usually loses my household simply for work and unwillingness.
The kitchen will be washed regularly as we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you been able to become more ordinary with your child?
We haven't been working on it yet, and this question has been busy for a long time.
Because for me, I have no incentive, it simply doesn’t bother me as long as there is no visit and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a larger incentive with your child, or do you stay stubborn?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, as well as anatomically pre-shaped cutting provides maximum comfort, perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with more specific, further pressure on the joints for improved movement freedom (on arm and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4, Flex System 2 has more than doubled the surface covered by the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Nail-free stretch panels on the joints reduce rigidity (axles, arms and knees)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and step-by-step ensure a perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the necklace area increases the flexibility around the necklace closure and thus improves the comfort, especially when scratching and mounting and placing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of arms and back.
Fireskin is a heating, waterproof material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive part of the body.
Nailless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face on the hook increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate headhair)
Soft, in the craving zone, the sealing improves with a finely adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, delicate clutch locking which does not correspond to the casting or the wires
Double sleeves with sleeves on arms and foot sleeves connect an inner sleeves with a soft, cast neoprene outer sleeves
45° attachment at the end of the inner mantle for increased elasticity and loadability when wearing.
Long sleeve lock on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cutting with increased comfort on the overall without hook
Long G-Lock P back lock (overall without hook) with metal screws and built-in water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Strap locks on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the strap locks to prevent rising if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels linked with external and internal coverage
edges of the outer handles for greater loadability
edges of the inner handles hardened for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer to its place, especially in the case of deeper propulsion (the system is compatible with all common armband computers)
Careers in social work - as someone with self-safe personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been educated for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I’m increasingly aware that this profession isn’t the right thing for me, why I have been thinking about restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem is that I have an uncertainty (or fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (EEA).
That means hardly that I have no self-esteem and therefore I’m ashamed.
I have no problem talking to people at a real level, but it’s very hard for me to conduct locker conversations, and I’ve been told more often that I’m invisible (which I think it has already become better).
Can I become so social workers?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or at an open youth meeting, but rather as a family advice or for example.
But I don’t know if the concrete working day is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something on the internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it draws me down whenever there is something on my code ("I'm getting the easiest things back off") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues ("I should really know myself now"/"I think it with my stupid questions about it" etc.
I will probably have the problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it in the place.
Did you have the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for this too.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean to give back!
If I downloaded a book to #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# message does not authorise this book
Is there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein constructs (amino acids) and builds out of it its own body proteins, which it also needs to form.
The swelling formation and the swelling formation of swelling birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high burden for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON bio should not be administered during the breeding, as otherwise there may be disorders in the brutal cycle.
Following this curious administration of NEKTON bio, it should be resumed to the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin Preparate) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral Preparate).

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A deleted tablespoon (incontinently) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON bio.
In case of severe fiber damage, the double or three-dose NEKTON bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of fiber reconstruction is visible.
After that, the normal dose will be completed until the reinforcement is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.

Pronouncement of a community employee in replacing the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property should be enjoyed a wool tree.
So a case request was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and therefore the wools are not part of the statute.
However, in the statute, the wool is explicitly indicated as a to protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On one side, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is obvious.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that's the only question is, yes, if I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check it?
Emergency report: severe traffic accident at Selb

Oh, okay, understand.
Well, thank you again that it was so easy!
Tips and ideas for further vocational life
Happy Christmas for you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my favorite head is just breaking everything you can break.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just making the ref as a crossing driver.
I originally studied something else and worked there in a field (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t call anything more precise here).
But all of it was too boring to me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Once I landed at the teacherramt and I was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly more flexible than in my previous profession, but it didn't matter to me.
I'm now here for the third "I Google Other Jobs".
And it's only about half a year.
In the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least end the reef, then I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time in the last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I would be stressful, but there was my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday evening.
That's where I was.
And stress at work was no matter at the moment.
I have too much stress on my own.
And then there are these strict structures that additionally nervous me.
Basically it makes fun and looks outwardly, the ref also runs well with regard to the feedback and so on.
But I’m totally exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body can endure before it makes it totally tight - if he doesn’t just do it.
I wonder if I want to have that rest of my work life so - just when I read some of your posts - or if I should not go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, I could take my time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but the case was not paid as appropriate as the individual was, and the time worked together in a team.
But then I wonder if in a year I am not at the same place as now and I am unsatisfied.
You see, it’s all kind of ours, but maybe you’ve come out as an outstanding advice or ideas like me from this situation that I’m completely finished and almost starting to cry at the smallest thought about it.
I’m not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the crying tone of me.
I hope that at least my situation has become a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has been constantly developing, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, perfectly matching the behavior of a pipe amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest in technology in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and Amp switches, the VTX amplifiers await an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analogic switches because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a pipe amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this curved circuit, the VTX amplifiers provide a closed housing and a bass reflection system from which the natural resonances only so sprout.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and connect historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to satisfy newly added sound requirements, which has again led to a performance shock of the VOX Valvetronix series – with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety can be filled here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and the dynamics of a pipe amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and raid attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers have discovered that the final stages particularly determine the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor Circuit of each VT+ amplifier, covered with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly decomposes the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA holds.
The Wagner Brothers can shine – however, it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost Magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large headquarters can also be adapted: with three individual place- and fold-able clutch lock parts, it is perfectly adapted to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for any type of camera – from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflectors.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible bending would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three switch lenses and a climbing slide.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave space for other lenses.
You can also cover a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-serie) can use the backpack for its equipment and photo-free things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
Within almost three months from the start of the eruption, the Lava Rivers have caused severe damage to the Canary Island.
Is the end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data about previous eruptions.
Although the activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has declined a little over the past few days, volcanoologists still haven’t expected any predictions when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damage in Millions
In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the warm Lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, according to RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter thick layer.
This corresponds to nearly 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 people had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Ahead of the coast, two new landings were created by cooled Lava, with a size of about 50 hectares.
It was particularly affected by the banana cultivation of the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly, which had been in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, the newspaper El País wrote.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly party.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the climbing tension somewhat deceitful.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly shared society together.
The more important it is to become aware of the sacred tradition of the gift, so that the gestures of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mouss, was a peaceful "societal treaty of natural peoples" can be deprived of the strict routine and can be re-entered with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became a Christian child
It was strictly taken by the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, gifts were handed over to some kind of way at Nikolaus.
The background of this still popular seat is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three women secretly gold into their windows in order to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular practice in Germany has emerged to fill the shoes with gifts especially for children.
Protestants stand on this practice because they refuse to mediate between God and human beings as a “sacrifice.”
For these reasons, they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nikolaus a Christian child and founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift went on to the Christmas evening.
Since most Protestants do not see such details, however, it is still the least angry that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the use of Martins with Martins and Martins withdrawal, is still a solid part of the prejudice period.
Today, you can find all the desired luxury hours of luxury in the front of the door and under the Christmas tree, all that the heart wants.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of the gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the reformation, the day of the gift disappeared on Christmas evening.
However, in all Christian-speaking countries, a joyful cuddle mud is dominated by the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on whether the Christian child appears at the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is in principle a type of Nikolaus, who has been assigned some species over time.
These include, for example, his white noisebart, which has only little in common with the rather strict Assyrian bart of the historical figure, his shells that are drawn from retirement and the favourite of the cabin to obtain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas party.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy is the witch Befana, who must have shown them the way to Jesus’ child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fabellens bring the gifts, while in Russia, the fathers brought Frost to some reputation.
Here are not cleaners, but three horses that drag their slits as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of reformation during the Hussit wars, the Christian child is responsible for the transfer of gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robbers near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
Police reported that callers had reported a man going to a bank with a gun and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly afterwards.
Shooting fell and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police didn’t get out of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are settled.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other relatives of the royal family also live there.

Pill Problems
Hello, dear women,
I hope I will do everything right here, reddit is my first post after a year.
To my problem: I’ve been resuming the pill about five years ago, especially because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and PMS dirty before the period.
Now I would like to leave it back because I already have to take enough medications because of chronic diseases that I can’t choose.
My main problem, not surprisingly the pain, but my skin.
I had a two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pickles everywhere.
As far as superficial, but it loaded me very well and I didn't feel comfortable.
Over the past two years, everything has never been normalized.
Maybe somebody has some tips to avoid this this time.
Without perfume and without gedons, my cosmetics is already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, women's doctor didn't take me so seriously and skin doctor's date is still here.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
The love of the skin is a new thing.
If prebuperter had bad neurodermitis, then for a while rest, then large-scale nose flour and the acne theme.
I also tried everything I could in the course of Chr. Disease, and I remained hanging down sugar, milk and meat mixture, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormone is just the worm in it, but if you like me have a building place, you would rather not go looking for anything else going wrong.
I already had all of her colleague semina.
Written and now I lost the conversation and I don’t know what was answered to my concerns.
I always have to work at the phone and there was suddenly everything gone...

110 kV earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the transfer of the new high-voltage cable to dents is legally powerful.
The planning decision of the Government of Lower Bavaria frees the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was reported by the Bayern Network Operator.
The roughly seven kilometres long earth cable will connect the Tann relief work in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt lead between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected close to the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of freeline.

Can you tell me what the next process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I’ve explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a commodity of glass and the whole sides are located, so it is located everywhere and the carton is broken
The commodity stands in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the commodity cannot be picked up because no one can enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message

Ref: Teaching Plans (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the reef since summer, teaching is fun to me, but I'm still having big problems in planning my lessons in Earth Sciences time-efficiently.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book, and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can only copy s/w for free (which is nervous for earthquake).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the subject of geofactors, and I am in fact standing for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don’t want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I actually always go out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe a teacher can work time-efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided for a new #PRS_ORG# but I would like to fix the return for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears due to the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales breaches.
He has also prepared a possible solution.
The 2G regulations, from the point of view of the Trade Association of Germany (HDE), ruin the main Christmas business to retail.
In the case of trades with items of non-day-necessity, sales breaches are to be complained, HDE chief businessman Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey of the HDE under 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively for the rest of the year.
Many have already written the Christmas business.
“What really should be the positive point of the year is now often a hole without ground,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis numbers over the past week.
It works well only in food retail and online.
The association demanded the consequences of dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe issue, said the head of business.
"2G is not going to continue in the fight against the pandemic," he said.
The current regulations scared customers and required high staff income.
The belt system must be approved all over the world, he said.
After that, every customer should only be controlled on 2G once (vaccinated or healed) and have access to all stores with the link that has been obtained on that day.
In addition, sample checks should be sufficient in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, healed or tested).
The German Euroshop, who specialized in shopping malls, also talked about a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at about 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the turnover at about 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall safely in the middle of such important Christmas business,” said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high staff and administrative efforts, the Center will try to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called banding solution, where "for example, visitors can provide their 2G guidelines once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - intact enter all shops".
I recently ordered and delivered #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a crater and on the frame is also an error that was attempted to be cast with a yellow filling.
That looks uncomfortable.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package.
How do I keep going for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature within the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to use.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flaming-free.
The 120-degree radiation angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance, is excellent.
Also in reporting situations in small spaces or short spaces.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work either in the film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted at difficultly accessible places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Further, the slot for the NP-F battery is located there (not included in delivery)
The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, it is simply displayed and finished by pressing one of the storage keys longer.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when disabled, so that the known situation is restored in new switches - very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can still check whether the battery has sufficient power before the set - it is a battery test equal to the built-in - for each of the two battery floors a value in the two display displays (the left upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the lighter continuously through the power supply supplied.
The construction of the lighter is very easy.
You have a 16mm helmet for attachment as a connector so that you can get it directly to your photo holiday.
The tendency is to be reliably adjusted through fixtures on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and therefore are also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a necklace is included in delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the supply.
This allows you to carry and store the lamps with all the accessories that you may want to buy yet, without any problems with transport or storage.
Shame that I have received and she is too small :(
"Party that we wanted to smell": Frankfurt celebrates a tremendous comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in a series of silent hessens were probably on the way to the next Bundesliga.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration over an overwhelming seasonal start from the soul and won Furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal lobby, to every individual who was there."
Initially, it seemed like a new damper for the Frankfurters who are still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the camp millennium with 2:0.
What happened then was impressed by the SGE coach.
“How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance,” Glasner continued.
I am very happy with the performance we have shown, and of course also with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who for the first time was able to stand back since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, also stressed the morality of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly big,” the 27-year-old said, and was excited to look at the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to make today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus focused on, but it also seems good in terms of the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we all have fit all players in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now, you want to "continue step by step and stay modesty" and take the tasks up to the annual change "at this level".
Next, on Wednesday in the course of the English week, Borussia Mönchengladbach will play an out-of-the-art game (18:30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I receive the email that my package comes back to you because of a mistake on my side.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me or I have to wait until the money is returned and resigned?
Unfortunately, I don’t mean that I’m going to be ordered again because it’s been a long time ago.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Women's handball dampers in front of the quarterfinals against Spain
Germany’s handball women are shaking after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parkett.
At the end of the World Cup main team, the DHB elections were held at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to win against hosts in Spain in the quarterfinals.
“We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” said the coach, Henk Groener.
We must stand against Spain differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danites (10:0).
It's sad that we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game we have to delete,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the struggle for the entry into the semi-final, a significant increase must take place against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday in order to keep the sharp dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German warrior in the Duell with the three-time Olympic winner in Denmark was backspace player Alina Grijseels with six gates.
“We just weren’t there – neither in the attack nor in the defense,” Xenia Smits said, “we have to look forward quickly now.”
From the front to the back not on the height
Unlike the previous five tournaments, the German team with the Anpfiff wasn't at the height.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and defence locks were responsible for a fast 0:4 relief after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented some parades from getting worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully closed a quick match.
The initial inflammation, however, wasn’t that.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danites, the German women were hardly able to sit on stage - and yet, mostly, they failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the door of the Scandinavian women.
So the game was running early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, particularly because backspace player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her counterpart.
However, in the quarterfinals, she can participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half, the DHB elections came a little better in the game and up to the pause to at least five doors.
The only quiet hope for a recovery after the change was at 9:19 after seven minutes.
Again, the Greene Shielders sinned in all areas and made it the well placed opponent, who at the end counts among the medal candidates, so that it would be easy.
As a result, the German team could no longer see an increase in performance and went as a clear loser of the parkett.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas season
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have repeated the Nikolaustag and take it as an opportunity to dedicate family traditions in the prejudice period, Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas and Christmas holidays.
How was that at the time at home?
What about your partner?
Do you want to share your traditions with your children?
What is the most beautiful for the children?
The shoes?
Placebacks?
Tree jewelry?
Will it be music?
Is the Christmas man, the Christian child, or is it the gift of grandmother and grandmother?
No matter how you do it, all of you give up and around Christmas effort to have it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether it’s a solid tradition or even something else every year: tell us how it’s going on in your family or how it’s going on!
Please send me a transaction number or something that could help.
Transfer confirmation... etc.
I would like to give a coupon code
Like #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that happen to them?
The title is, I am acting as a vaccine in mobile vaccine teams where (as long as only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, etc., is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished to a large portion, then it goes partly into vaccine centers for me.
I like to answer questions without time limit to the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, unless they are personally related (e.g. "I take drug X, that is tolerated by vaccination.").
In my field of tasks, the explanation for the vaccination, the indication position (persons have the right to a coronary vaccination and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation and, if applicable, the emergency care for allergic reactions (we never happen before).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccines, however, we often do not have "only" but (for God's sake) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccines, but who can't (maybe?) carry out vaccines, so I also carry out most vaccines there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "skinder"?
With this dialect, sent by an amberger, BR TV broadcast "We in Bavaria" has been provided for harsh thinking.
However, unlike many days ago, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained uninformed by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "that everything has to go quickly."
That, people heard from the TV moderator, is totally wrong.
The Amberg man informed the solution, and thereby, probably, made surprises in many top floors.
"The skincareer," the spectators found, "is a lap with which someone covers the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been surveyed as an expert from Bayerian television for years, confirmed.
With the note, this is a typical overfacial term, derived from somehow known mouthwash "Houdern".
With which a lack of education was closed - perhaps even in some who have lived in the room for a long time.
I haven’t been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
The following error message always comes after confirmation: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired to PC.
Nothing helped.
Is the tire choice at the race-- really so panic-safe?
Tomorrow I was awakened full of action because I wanted to prepare my bike tour next week at least a little bit.
I said, did, and I went with my race bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then that happened in every city centre (this time: Thanks Krefeld!).
Glass stripes on the route.
Zack, laughter, and my back tire didn't want to join the rest of the route at all.
Because I had no real way to provide me with replacement shirts and swabs due to the day of the week, I had to turn back with a bad halfway and take the first train home.
If it wasn’t too bad, it would be better if I practice it again with the change of tires before the bike tour.
But now I stand in front of a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over a few days before me, I would be extremely tired of getting this problem more often.
Now it wasn’t really bad, even the old tires of the predecessor (very nice old man, the day I picked up my bike, I broke up to 14h 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimally because he’s been on the role with them for more years.
But if I think I have to take a tire change while driving 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly sounding :D
Now I came to a conversation with an older man on the railroad, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole sounds very attractive.
But are these really so incapable?
I don’t want to spend 40€/tires now, just to be disappointed.
I’m still wondering: I’m currently on the racing bike I believe 25x622.
They are also available (perhaps?) with the Marathon Plus tyres, but most of them are already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tyres at a race wheel?
The sweat-side seems to me absolute! Do you prefer to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and dear greetings!

After the release of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was just a question of time until our SOLO series would be re-growing.
SOLO 15 means the new spraying and optically reminds the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitablely designed foot is directly included to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This does not affect acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very good for individuals whose maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but soundly to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply unable to produce nearly unfiltered so large sound pressure levels.
This does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and appears for its size extremely impressive and precisely.
The SOLO 15 tone was adjusted with a slight high tone rise.
This is generally common in broadbands to optimize the strongly increasing merger of too high frequency.
Exactly directed on the hearing aid, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Slightly outwardly rotated can reduce the high tone area, thus making the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimum stereo triangle is measurable and surprisingly accurate.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM result in a fine dynamics that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands them in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our construction sets, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in construction.
For example, if you want to furn the housing, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the furnier is refurnished with material.
After all the plates have been adjusted (e.g. in the construction market), first a 8 mm hole should be bored into the floor plate at the corresponding location so that the cable can be carried out there later easily.
With the help of an upper fraction, the speaker's opening in the front is now followed so that the B 100-6 OHM can be used subsequently.
The rear should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible in the interior.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the phase, as shown in the image "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls in front of you on a flat surface.
Now on these the back wall, the cover, the front and the floor are shielded.
The three moves should also be used and scratched.
The displacements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example, if you want to use finished supplies from the construction market instead of making them from 16 mm MDF themselves.
In the next step of work, the second side will be mounted.
Then all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of an appropriate hole crossing or forest drilling, the installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting clamp on the rear wall, is facilitated.
After that, you use a round-freeze to round all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded.
The footplate is then fastened with the foot of the housing and in addition crushed with long wood screws.
Following is the sign and pre-bore (2.5mm bore) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned from wooden dust (absorbent/burning), you begin with the laying of the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflection in the back wall.
The entire and unbreakable cable is shipped by piece through the 8 mm bore in the foot until the terminal opening, allowing it to stand up there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the opening of the speaker and allows it to be locked out there as well.
The frequencies will be prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequencies, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be removed from the following document: Installation manual Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency wire is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the box, which is not yet fully closed, follows.
With the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and somewhat skilled, you can leave hot stickers to the opening and thus close them.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now the earthquake follows according to description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and fixed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so the plus line (marked cable) must be used on the pluspole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the base reflector is cut and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For the welding, a mat of the vaporing material is cut into two parts and distributed lockerly in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflection channel should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let it be delivered at the beginning of June?
"Hello to all,
> we can finally announce that we will reorganize the OSCAST this year too!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has a higher planning burden and explains the short term of the announcement.
But there will be at least three people per switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 bowls in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid Delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still on the pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as fun as possible.
> It's going to go about 0:30.
Already set up cold drinks, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
