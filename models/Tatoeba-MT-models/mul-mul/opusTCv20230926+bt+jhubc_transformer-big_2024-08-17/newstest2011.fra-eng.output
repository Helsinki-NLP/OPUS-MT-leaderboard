What's going on? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pasture in Prague.
New CSSD elected in the capital city will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand themselves at the municipal level with their former and new ODS colleagues.
Actualne.cz has “tested” the new members of the CSSD municipal council, namely whether they know the boss who was born in the last years to the maire, when they were the partners of the current coalition who were heading in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It’s surprising that the new elected people don’t really understand the well-known terms.
At least they say that.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a youth in Prague politics," responded Lukas Kaucky, the elite to culture in the test of the vocabulary of "parrain".
And with regard to political veterans, eloquent Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of “golf spot”.
“It’s the only expression that you propose to me to use.”
Otherwise, I don't use the arrow.
From the vocabulary, whose Aktualne.cz newspaper published the expressions in June this year before the pre-electorial congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, primarily those associated with the Prague Mayor.
Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the largest golf hole in Prague", to go to patience", "near cow", "training the capital" and "intoler".
Three of the electors agreed for the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first a interview but then did not dismiss the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek rejected the test.
“I don’t care about these things at all and how the representatives of civil democracy are fun: I won’t give my opinion.”
“I am currently dealing with how we will understand ourselves within our programs,” he said.
As we have already heard, eloquent Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the legend above, that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem mayor.
"Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucky and the only expression he deviated in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says, and immediately adds, "But I know the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay a language course," he joke.
Not only is the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, chosen for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two social-democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks in the sense of "going to pasture".
"I think it's going to a business," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
On the same thing, your Brezina reminds you that he draws his knowledge rather than newspapers than any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for tests, there is no lexique of arch in social democracy.
“I have consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really don’t have anything like that.”
“The names are sometimes used by abbreviations and symbols,” said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, whose members call Hulda.
"My name was Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like that," said Karel Brezina about surnames.
The Actuel.cz journal has tested the name and it works.
Weinert’s elu is Papy for the party members or the least friendly Little Old, representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention to him before the elections by scrolls during the party sponsoring, is called “the small game”.
The surnames are also the only ones they admit to employ within the Social Democratic Party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn’t like much to hear Hulda, but the newspaper Akutel.cz has recorded another surname for this Pragoian president.
"Doctor in Law of Matrace," he recalls that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his doctorate title in Law of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of the "squirrels", issued a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the old generation, can’t work for example for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sorcery" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
“Man rarely has this fate.”
“Young women are not judged as they participate in work and give birth to children,” said a sister who is occupied in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by the company.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He issued a brochure that should help limit hunting to witches.
The case includes a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don’t know how to read,” the newspaper Die Standard warned about the disadvantages of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, near Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil that they had asperged him.
This is the BBC's server who transmitted this information.
The criminals say that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves ritual onctions has inflammed in the contact of the woman.
The oil fell, he seemed, when the team wanted to "hunt the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of the "sortices" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard cited a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: “Human spirit eaters have always been a danger,” he said.
While Burkina Faso strives to reduce the hunt for witches, Gambia not later than last year even saw the President himself participating in it.
“The gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt’s death, launched a wide hunt for witches who, he seems, would have participated in his death and would have been stripped by the black magic of killing the President as well.”
"The chamans of Guinea near the rescue, led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police and the personal guard of the President, men and women chosen by randomly dance in Gambia villages," the Amnesty International said in a message.
In the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion of hallucinogenic effects that in addition to other effects on kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
Bakal’s renter: The poets warm, he signed a higher rental.
An imposing elderly man went out by the RPG Byty customer center of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: the one of his daughter and son who trained to clean up a punishment.
The deregulation has increased the lease for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to adjust from next year for an apartment 2+1 of the second category 4100 crowns.
“And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel,” the finger shows on his son’s new contract the man who has the power to sign.
"But I have signed yet," he explains in anger and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Citizen Association, which has described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises the renters not to sign and wait until 7 December, the date on which a notice will be published to explain how to apply.
But man reacts to this by a hand gesture.
"One says that, the other says something else," facing the rings.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rentals do not correspond to the market price.
Aktualne.cz has decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The RPG waiting room in the street Havirovska is one of the four in the region of Ostrava and it is already full on Tuesday at 09:00 in the morning.
Just next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is illuminated on the touch screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number already begins to shine on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to find out about the rental, but new rentals do not seem to relate to people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - request for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the region of Ostrava, people with more than 44,000 apartments from the RPG portfolio collect emails with new bail contracts in their letters boot since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers them rental increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The Special Guichet for New Rentals has been open to the public since November 18th.
"It's working for almost a week, so it's still testing," he says, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the shelter when the client appears as a journalist.
The deregulation and the former apartments of minors in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the parliament and originating in the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported it in a fairly supportive manner before the elections and this now fills local newspapers.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"They haven't even changed a sheet in the toilet, they're relieved by the introduction of the men mentioned.
However, most of all, according to employees, they are retired who come to be sure they will receive a restaurant on the new rental price if they now sign as promised by RPG in a special offer.
It is a restaurant that will receive half of the lease amount from the other leasers who will sign their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" guichet of the street Havirovaska is really not covered by questions.
“Among the 360 customers who arrived yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent,” the staff said.
However, RPG puts both on its website and in the vitrines of individual interviews on rentals when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rental, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“It’s not threats but only to inform you about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on his website.
"No one will go to court here," thinks one of RPG Byty employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center gives him a right.
“I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks no one to sign and therefore people are waiting for," she said.
The lease regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
“In addition, current rentals still don’t reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund,” says Pavel Klimes, director of RPG Byty’s residence portfolio, that is just the negligence of the housing fund that makes the renter angry.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with the rentals in 4 billion apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen attached to the ceiling in front of the back chairs of the Havirosvka street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The increase in lease in 2011 is 15 percent and applies not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns at m2 per month," the screen says.
The increase of 38% applies only to 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low amount of 19.66 Czech crowns at m2," RPG adds.
Next year the rental will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical, but progressive increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the lease increase (cf. the graph) is returned to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lease increase agreement have the priority.
The maternal school is part of it, as well, offices have understood the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he also hosts a mini maternal school with everything he needs - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
Arch. Design. the project-architecture company, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, has imagined its mini-mother school of business since the first constructions of the Avriopoint building.
It employs about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it cares that women architects and project managers can quickly return to work.
At the same time as time-decreased work contracts, the maternal school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Constructors and architects have the opportunity to allocate a work that takes care of children.
These are the employees of Arch.Design. themselves who have imagined this maternal school and with the support of the management they have been able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini maternal school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and equipment and, after two years, to provide qualified staff as well as launch.
After using the funding dotation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the mini maternal school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is the company Economy rating that helped to make the application for dotation.
Children’s care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and maternal nurse care for children. children can go to maternal school without limitation of age but they are more than three years old.
As it is a "mini maternal school" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who replace it.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the program of the mini maternal school is comparable to that for preschool education.
Children do not just play there, but there is also quality education there – from the beginning to the preparation to school banks, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of delay to go searching for children in a remote school from the workplace of their parents.
Parents use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employer and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus enrolled among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruitment of new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program enhances RH marketing.
The house in the bones is still fascinated after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The tooth resembles the back of a prehistoric Sauric, the staircase of a backbone of dinosaur and the balconies of open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the surname of Maison in bones from the locals.
Organic forms, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of squares and mosaics, facade reminding the scales and everywhere present of curves, this is all that is ypic for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front facade of the house runs its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and order can be seen accurately.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is illuminated in such a way that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced.
The rolling and torsion of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
The wood copys in waves the window frames, balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the oil and the lamps.
The Battlo house is located in the Eixample neighborhood in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number. 43, was born from the construction of a 1877 house by architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction was made for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first emphasized the demolishment of the old construction and the construction of another entirely new but quickly accepted Gaudi’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a home in multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is just on its project that the decorations are born for an apartment representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
For the facade, other artists and creatives have also worked.
The joint work on the plans of Casa Battlo house began with successive cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals named the hot house just after it was finished due to its organic forms "The House in the bone".
Others, given the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the dancing house".
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of St. Georges, the boss of Catalonia.
Other sculpture elements of the construction contain hidden religious patterns.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time,with typical airways and chambers.
Their 45-degree inclination looks weird.
During the creation of Gaudi, he was absolutely not obedient to the construction directives of the time and was not allowed to be obstacled by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the permission to build, knowing, of course, that the data carried on the reconstruction plans were so waves that two years after finishing the municipal council was frightened and asked for modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the municipal council that the construction pillars were emptied on the public trottoir.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and get satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third one room and a private part of the apartment.
The floor was rented to a jewelry.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a stairs through which you can access up to an independent tooth terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the hall doors and the high company can communicate comfortably or either limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the renovation of Gaudi received in addition to new facades a non-traditional tower and two additional floors.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the interior court is decorated and with the light pits.
The two-color game gives maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was just enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the dark that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to pass this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found that it was a profitable business and they expanded the field of visits to the common spaces and to the branch, including roof terraces.
The entry ticket to the monument is not really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20% discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a companion among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a matelas and a sleeper: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatory frame, but rather the quality of the bed-reserved surface, so the mattress and the top give a real base for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement themselves harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice, several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which you will place the mattress and the top is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where the latex mattresses are not constantly sleeping are not suitable as they "heat" slowly.
They also have a weight higher than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and remain on a solid plate, they retain moisture. From moisture can also be formed there.
The habit is also decisive in choice.
Those who spend the clear time abroad where they often use very thick mattresses with a sharp layer will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“This is how all NHL hockey players complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and coasts, they needed mattresses with a sharp layer of perishable mousse."
“That matte is also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder in the nervous system that thus misunderstood the “information” of the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in remedy furniture.
That’s why a few years ago, the matelas with the parseous mousse conquered the hockey players as well as other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex, but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have appropriate mattresses.
You don't need to be a guy from NHL to be able to appreciate a dirty mouse.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or fits to the heat of your body.
Nothing makes pressure on you and you will not return at night as well as after a difficult match.
You just sleep better.
The brush mousse also works as a protection against screws.
For choosing the mattress depending on your size, add the length of your feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180 cm need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-place bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm total.
For beds in one place, for example, singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of visit.
'Nevertheless, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should put your hands comfortable with the slightly wrapped coats. Helena Prokopova, Chairman of the Association of the Bourreliers-Matehouses and decorators who have been dedicated for several years to the problem of a mobility in sleeping and sleeping.
For a two-bed each needs its own bed and mattresses, so pay attention, however, during the acquisition, to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, you will only stay up the summit at different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
The mousse mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses should be at least 15 cm, of which it counts for the shape and ventilation layer at least three centimeters.
"When you touch or sit on the mattress, you should not feel the springs," Héléna Prokopova warns.
Each matelas requires a well-determined type of sleep.
The sofa bed, when the mattress and the sofa bed are united as the Simitian sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The matelas have gone very bad; you should not wash it, which is commonly done today.
And since during the night we normally breathe from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the matelas begins to remind a large (and blown) thick.
For this, experts refuse to make a 25-year lifetime claim for a mattress or life warranty.
But all the more.
And for this, an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but rather add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if today it is common to make coatings with sliding closing for the whole, that is, after opening, we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for only one person) becomes a heavy ring when we remove them between a lightweight and a lightweight.
Do you have a stiff plate in your bed instead of a bed?
Never!
A maximum for one bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the sheet (if there is no) air holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in pockets (German Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of this type of bed.
For single-position laminations with 14/18 laminations, latex laminations or so-called sandwiches (maybe the combination of latex and coconut nuts), they are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a lamination lamination with more laminations, 28 and above, where laminations are duplicated in the lower lamination of the kidneys.
For multiple position mattresses, it is not necessary to take mattresses from springs because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the stiffness adjustment of the lame can also be installed what is called a shoulder wheel.
This is a special link to the lame that allows you to make pressure or even push the lame to make the sleeper shoulder "integrate" well.
For men who have “the shoulders as wide as the back,” it is really important.
This is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses that for "masculiars" began to use a rammoling area at the shoulders level.
But they also think of women - they offer them a softer surface at the level of the hanks again.
For the most difficult customer there are wings or platelets with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure spreads into more points and diminishes tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad coat (big and air-inflammatory) on good mattresses and sleeping, the "most" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple curtain: the curtain must support the head and its points must only reach the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians prefer for example.
When allocated on the side, the shoulder should be upgraded (with the shoulder ring of the top or the wrapped area in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first on the basis of pail and herbs.
The manufacturers still use natural materials or lots of mixtures.
The trend is also in biomatrix.
The raw materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soya.
“The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made based on natural products,” says Petr vasicek from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop aromas of forest or lavendey.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of bowl plants for the coating of the matelas absorbs the heat and cools the body, the coatings "cooled" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for weak sex.
The current preferred ones?
The mattresses made from cold mushrooms (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidity of cold moulds gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, the bottom of the back and the feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Saving for matelas and sleeping is not easy.
There can be special actions from time to time from the manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with Memory memory mousse coated to coating for 11990 crowns.
Of course, you can take the second for free.
The era of parseous or viscoelastic moulds with an open cellular structure and a large thickness has been started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were under the start of enormous charge factors.
The temper climbs in the heat and stings, on the contrary, in the cold.
Hence it perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic mushrooms are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot coats that relieve the legs and the vein system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver mould or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child brings more and more people to think to monitor them through a GPS.
The system, which was initially set up to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help for some cases, such as little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a clamp but will soon be of the size of a watch.
The case of the little Anicka emulated a lot of people and they started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that it is not spying, but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” says Petr Pilin from MAcro Weil, one of the Czech market tracing devices providers.
“I swear that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the pocket of a person who is not aware, but I haven’t yet met such cases.”
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons,” said Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes it is used "the bow" and how to use it in an emergency.
Children’s psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention that if the child does not want to wear something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
“And even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Cell phones, which can be cut like these tracing devices, have already brought parents to long expectations,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very controversial.
“If it’s a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it.”
“That’s the phone right now.”
“As soon as tracking devices will develop, they (the criminals) will find them as well as as the sales will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
“In such cases, criminals will always be in advance on the police,” said the psychologist.
It supports as well as such devices can help in an aggression not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, it says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of assault.
"The device can be parametered in such a way that it is in regular emissions after a specified period."
"In the case of the device being destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains still."
“The more expensive devices also have a clinometric signal that immediately signals the position of the person who moved and remains in an extended position without moving,” said Chech.
According to him, the so-called smart phones that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special software.
The problem of the current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to that weared in a pencil of the size of a lampboard or to the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to the Macro Weil company Pilina, tests are currently being carried out to make devices similar to common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Oh well, he'll find out after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracing device is developed in the form of bracelet or pencil, it will always use the same technology as car tracing.
It is a combination of acquisition systems of a position using the GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating belts that she could turn the Czech Republic with, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of ropes used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense had purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the rods is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonating corals to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The general-major state gave as a reason the acquisition of a huge amount of MF DNES detonating rods that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES contacted, it shows that even generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating corals.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that was true, the army reserves could be subsidized for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, more than 2 meters of detonating corals, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has provided reserves - also with the consumption of special units and engineering - for the 225 years mentioned.
Nevertheless, rapid intervention brigade soldiers recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no munitions for their guns and that shooting sessions were limited due to the need for money.
We don't talk about the lack of body clothes.
"And I don't take my head if they buy so many detonating belts from us."
“It’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us the army is a good customer we strive as traders to satisfy,” said STV Group business director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokeswoman of the Ministry of Defense, argued purchasing hundreds of miles of detonating belts by the fact that the army will have these " munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky from the STV Group, however, reported that only four years of detonating corals and the police and army pyrotechnicians were only two years of life.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can even run up to four years," said one who doesn't want his name to be published in relation to the military's criticism.
The last lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrated and does not threaten the soldier’s life.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the amount of 445 km of detonating rods.
“They cost us 60 percent less than the supply of 245 km last year,” said the spokesman Pejsek, who interpreted the statement by the Defence Ministry’s buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police still order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This has been established for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and to be able further to obtain more flexible, more modern and more reliable detonating types.
The Ministry of Defense today has major problems with the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovakia army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move onto the Rhine.
What the Czech army expects in a few years that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating belts that it buys today "in affordable".
To date, I am taking advantage of the contacts I have received through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to be the winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun loved travelling.
And abroad, he realized that in Libérec there was a lack of quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of high school, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me a desire to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he transformed into retirement with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year he had another identical quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other Pytloun hotel franchise candidates were manifested," the entrepreneur number 1 last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the contest of the entrepreneur of the year has served well," Pytloun added.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me, and, I have to say, it was very nice," he recalled.
He recommends participation in this contest to all who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he uses his contacts and knowledge so far that he couldn't get it in a different way.
“With those I met thanks to the competition, I started maintaining business relationships regularly.
According to him, the success-related reputation also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
“I observe at their home especially the loyalty and pride of being engaged in something that has been generally recognized.”
“This is not, and from far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than that we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to seek the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the year’s Competition for the Firm organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed a tool workshop in Ceska Skalice into a business company of $100 million.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged my employees as well and has increased our confidence in self-confidence to fight competition,” he said.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the conquest of the assets by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a company where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few companions in the surroundings of his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic press in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized audience after the success of the competition through the media.
“Not only our customers have begun to really better know the Farmet brand but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they have collaborated with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country of origin,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year, Farmet was not only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was made from the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the hardest year for sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their assets of new materials and technologies.
“Obviously, we have not escaped this situation.”
“The business has fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even release,” Karel Zdarsky said.
A viable society must know that it is necessary to take unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained beneficial results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
“We built a training and research center with the dotations, strengthened the company’s presentation at international exhibitions and won the main awards at national exhibitions,” Zdarsky says.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of employees are rising, and the number of employees are also with them.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes stupid regulations.
The year’s Absurdity investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glorious winner of this year’s Study of Absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring in the offices the documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration demanded a paper extract from the trade registry while the official can get it in two mouse clicks.
It changes thanks to the investigation.
“The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require the withdrawal of the trade register for insurance payment checks,” said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfill in the Czech Republic and to delete those who are absurd is the meaning of this concourse of the year’s absurdity.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If 3,000 voters have demonstrated last year, it is at least 4,000 that voted this year.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only make the company brake, and, this, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to fill in for tax statements at the first places in the world," Karel Havlicek from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic said.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a goal declared by all governments over the past few years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place in terms of business conditions, 8 more places compared to last year.
The Competition of the Year’s Absurdity was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report every year administrative and bureaucratic absurdities from April to the end of September, last time before the competition is closed.
In order to report on the website www.firmaroku.cz, the organizer of the contest then chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and leaves the public to vote during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the highest number of votes is declared a winner.
Until last year's investigation, it is a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the “finalists” of the competition, for example, is the obligation for the maintenance of highways and fastways, or entrepreneurs with twenty employees, to repay two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the contest site.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November at the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of an eventing in which regularly participate the personalities of political and public life.
For example, this year, Eva Svobodova, director of the Association for Small and Medium Companies of the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended at the time of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts atons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this reason my goal is to eliminate at least three tens of paragraphs that today make the company only complicated,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
The effort to eliminate absurd decrees is not a sword strike in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the individual company in the place where the company is located, the intention of going to an exhibition or pelerinage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the penalty of the Individual Companies Act.
The second most pleasurable obligation in 2007, which was to declare a 30-day service trip to a foreign employee at the Work Office, was deleted with the text of the Act on what is called the Green Card.
And it's all right until the third session of the competition.
The 2009 Absurdity was the decree for physiotherapeutics to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible companies.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The newness of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Firme Responsible of 2010.
The objective of this competition is the reasonable and fair support for the company.
“We want to support companies that monitor the impacts of their business on the environment and carry out a socially responsible activity,” says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantee and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the year’s rival competition.
For this first year of this sub-category of the company’s 2010 competition, organized by Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich inspiration and an independent article would be edited.
Although the subject of their business is different from each other, their support and prediction activities can be considered as the nominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not an example of the Pragoese prological company Et Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in a number of tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of company responsible for the region of Pardubice is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the support fund for children with disabilities for 17 years.
In order to take care of health-related employees, it is still possible to cite the old Podebrad paper manufacturing factory, which employs more than 70 percent of it and which, for this purpose, has obtained the title of the company responsible for the central Bohemian region and which has been third in the region in the competition of the company of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing assoupled working hours and even decreased to 35 hours a week on average and, without, proportionally, wage reduction.
The jury also devoted the title to him because it prioritizes Czech manufacturers, supports a dietary activity in the nearby environment and is concerned about the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to ensure that our business and administration have the least environmental impact,” said Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s executive director.
The IT company responsible Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has created them for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their homework and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the foundation The Man in the Shadow that helps the local Rome community,” said Ondrej Suchy, representative of the society.
In the last place, for its activities, is also a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in retirement insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
“In our company we contribute to food, transport, increased qualifications and leisure,” said Joseph Strapac from the construction company bruntal Czasch, winners for the Moravia-Silesia region.
They were automatically enrolled in the company category Responsible, all regional finalists for the Vodaphone Signature Competition, who had responded to the questionnaire in annexed documents for registration and had sent it to the organizer before August 15.
The misfilled or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the lice firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the Competition Company but were not disqualified from the "principal" Competition Vodaphone Company of the Year."
“Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the year’s firm’s main competition,” says Karel Goldman, Bison&Rose’s organization agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public contest
In the Plzen Land Fund building, the anti-corruption police have conducted arrests in recent days.
Detectives transferred the money to the local entrepreneur and traded in real estate Lubos. G.
He had strived to correctly manipulate a public tender call for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed field is obtained by a particular candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a criminal offence as part of a tender call and public competition," said Plzen Parket chief Antonie Zelena, who knows it is forbidden to provide more explanations as the investigation is underway.
Police resigned after 24 hours this 46-year-old entrepreneur.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate on such little official information.
In a question of Pravo, the spokeswoman of the Lubomira Cerna Terrain Fund said that police had actually been arrested in Plzen at a separate workplace, and that was during the public competition.
"He acted as a client and in no case a employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as a real name "Appel to propose rights for land transfer under the Land Law" and is set up when several rights-benefit candidates are manifested.
"These people, as part of the appeal, propose a higher value of their rights to refunds that must be adjusted before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the rights proposed, a purchaser ranking is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who has offered the highest rights," the spokesman of the Fund said.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information on those who had entered the appeal and as he himself was, also a beneficiary person because he had purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the field candidates not to participate in the contest.
And he was probably disturbed by retiring.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpellation.
Lubos G. had contacts widely above standards at the FdT (Fonds of Terrains).
He was included in the case of former head of FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted for editing grounds for which the decision to establish a construction had already been issued.
Just Lubos G. had obtained, for example, lands intended for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access artery was to be built to the industrial area of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historical center of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was forced to accept because otherwise she risked to put the construction in danger by blocking the grounds.
Households will pay an extra of a hundred crowns per month for the housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and cleaning, heating supplies and in some places the renters will also increase.
Therefore, families will have to take off their wallet from January to a hundred more monthly crowns than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be cheaper.
The increase in electricity for households in the apartment should increase the 100 crowns annually more than currently.
However, all suppliers have decreased electricity prices because of the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
You can also count a hundred crowns in addition.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in central heating price varies from city to city.
These are mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for the central heating of nearly 50 more crowns per month from January, the Libérec families will pay more than 1,000 crowns per year.
For Prague residents there is a 9 percent increase in water and healthcare in case the city increases in infrastructure rentals.
If the renters do not change the pragoes, they will pay an extra of 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest compared to the whole country.
In North Bohemian, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, lease prices will significantly increase in the 450 thousand apartments for rent from January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns nearly 2500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new lease increase will be translated to courts by the company.
Regular rentals that people pay in nearly 300,000 apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
The Czech children live in rhum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts slowly.
The fernet, the rhum, the vodka, and in an exceptional way the best brand of whisky are also stolen by parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are healing, who are not yet fifteen years old, in the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated at the hospital for recurrence do not make an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors encountering cases similar to the admissions of hospital children departments.
“Beer or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be safe.”
"The trend is really strong alcohols," said Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemian.
“When they manage to cheat a bottle to dad in the wardrobe, it’s sometimes whisky, but it’s the fernet and vodka that prevalent.”
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so don't feel it," said the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman of the Motol Hospital, also gives her a right.
"Generally, it's rhum or fernet."
“It is today fashion alcohol, especially in primary schools.”
"In some cases, he acted as a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to Pelikan, seeing drunk children aged 13 to 14 at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was at Motol where he exercised ten years in pediatrician, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
“A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve years when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in blood dance with an additional mixture with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What is interesting is that it doesn’t seem strange to the mother that his daughter is absent 48 hours,” said the Director of the Department.
It is just the parent’s disinterest or their toleration outside the common fact that their rejections come from drinking which are the main cause of the development of children’s alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no question of dependence, in its strict sense, for children.
“As the alcoholic vocabulary, there is a chronic alcohol dependence for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that it is not found in children.”
"For those who use the acool for repetition, it's rather a significantly unfavourable back-ground-social-family," Pelikan Department Chief explains.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty drunken children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
They are integrated into statistics only in cases with a sweat of intoxication that requires hospitalization.
Drink children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, Pélikan exhibits three seasonal waves with which you can count: the Witch Day, St. Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
“Everything they drink after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
“Of course, I lived on the witchday an admission of seven drunk children at a single time,” Pelikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night at the hospital under medical control is paradoxally in a better position than the one who came home and suffers the next day of the "wood bowl".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
“They are better locked because they spend a great evening and then a soft wake and nothing hurts them.”
“They’re just surprised at where they are,” Pélikan adds, knowing that from time to time it ruins the patient’s good mood at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and hospitalization on intensive care beds can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
“Occasionally, I applied this as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drinking has cost and that they could spend the whole summer working seasonal to pay back a single night,” Pelikan said.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regression management, which should recover from parents care-related charges, do not treat cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 out of five in total, against which the Ministry of Defense exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, landed to Seville on Tuesday in Spain where the manufacturer of aircraft Casa-EADS is located.
This is the first time such devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they were abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are biplace versions of the L-159T1 that have been in service so far in the Czech army and are in flight.
Lestrois remaining devices are monoplace versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol company - took into account them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek from the Department of Defense Press, the physical departure of Vodochody aircraft is currently unknown.
"The L-159 monoplaces planned for exchange have been taken on long-time aircraft stored without causing additional burdens or investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," Pravo Pejsek said.
He played that the army will not remain unpleasant as the ministry signed an agreement of 200 million crowns with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 for the transformation of four unused L-159 single-places into twopleases.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek, EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Allied countries.
"In the contract it is clearly stated that those taking into account the planes L-159 are EADS and that they will serve to train pilots from NATO member countries."
"Therefore, it is the case of one who considers how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa plane and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion crowns was entered last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defense did not file an offer and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued while the exchange ensures future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased 72 aircraft at Aéro Vodochody and only uses 24, selling the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will likely have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because aircraft had to be chosen as part of a European tender call and in no case directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the latter is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely Airport in two weeks.
A longer index than cancellation is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the longer index than the cancellation are exposed to a lesser risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the male hormone level of testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men aged 60,” said co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be subjected to prostate cancer test, particularly by combining genetic risks or other aggressive factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in the UK over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the cancellation.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the cancellation risk, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk decreased to 87 per cent.
The length of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that helps to develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but that he does not seem to, he seems, that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer is "fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 highways are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and trottoirs, there is most of the time compact snow, the debris worked all night in many places.
The D5 highway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometer towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 aurous route to Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The dispatcher of the Automotive Central Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91nd kilometers a truck was accidented, at the 93nd two heavy weights struck, the accident injured.
Several cars have also been found in the bushes.
The problems are also on the D1 highway to the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go to Brno and then enter the 182th kilometer in Kyvalka.
A row of cars of several kilometers formed in this place.
Also on the D11 highway there is an accident and, right at the arrival of Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeter thickness, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, car rows are created in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also busy.
The safest way to transport is the subway.
Tramways take delay, for example, on the line between Charles Place (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours in the morning, the state-major of Prague crisis must still meet.
Railroads and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to remove because of the snow 7 fast connections.
Lines such as Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport has been closed since Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.
Most of the routes in South Moravia are already rollable, but by increasing vigilance.
On the road of Vyskov, three sideways are unpleasant, on the road of Brno it begins to be there by places of snow raffles and on the road of Blansko the chains are mandatory to pass certain communications paths in the places above.
The region of Vyskov was one of the most affected places.
So far the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them, it may be necessary to send snowboards and snow springs.
You can't be estimated when they're rollable.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is strict in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, in view of nature protection, maintained only by the aspersion of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemian, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the region of Moravie-Silesia, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow gradually disappeared in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. army sent to Afghanistan a new "smart" weapon, known only as the code XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic gun will have an impact on the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The 25 mm calibre special ammunition developed for this gun and containing a high-breaking explosive, actually works like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic pathway.
So you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a obstacle, a wall or a knife.
It is also not protected from above, and when it falls on him a murderous rainfall of steel shields, it can also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon to use the "smart" technology.
"The soldier is essentially used in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise point of reference, according to which he corrects his intended site and pushes on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've made 543 meters away."
"When you press the relaxation, the gun loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters more than 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 displaced jobs
The Fujitsu group moved its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the office building of the Mareinbader Place in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group moved its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As stated Wednesday, the giants specialized in computer manufacturing and maintenance, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on the Lyoner Straße du Niederrad Quartier in Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should gather 100 other jobs that have been expanded to date in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the outdoor offices of Astro Park are better suited to the working mode of employees.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just renter.
The CEO, Bernd Wagner, said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a primary place for us with a remarkable infrastructure.”
He claims that connection to the airport is just of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region raised yesterday the joy of the winner and caused the losers’ disappointment.
The Economic Officer of the Frankfurt Municipality, Markus Frank (CDU), said once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith relative instead of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implantation is an important elan for Niederrad.
Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The Directorate has informed the municipality of this intention very early.
"It will be without saying we have offered our assistance to this company," Korwisi said.
Nevertheless, friendly relations could have changed nothing to the computer manufacturer’s difficulties facing the owner of the building of Place Marienbader.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now about avoiding such an exceptional place that remains unemployed for a long time.
"I hope the owner and dancer of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hotel de Ville, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the neighbouring "little vertical" and the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
The result of a joint municipality project and a private project developer, a new city entry was created between the station and the City Hotel, which raised many reviews, not only because of the impressive arrangement of surfaces that once served as part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment advice company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, the German Group of Frankfurt Specialist Immobilien-Chancen purchased buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were sold back to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered the third largest provider of computer products in the world.
For example, it puts computers and servers at the disposal of companies and also provides essential services.
Its subsidiary established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has much more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to reside in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, its name recalled its star-shaped plan, houses among other things the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Server Expulsion by Amazon - threats against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly experiencing difficulties.
Amazon Internet Service Provider has expelled from its servers the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may hide from political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to stay in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is attacked with increasing force.
The Wikileaks cyber activist group no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called the other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched for by Interpol, is likely to stay in the UK, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," cyber-activists reported on Wednesday (local time) originally through the Twitter social network.
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the highest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent on taking care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon ban Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's employees.
The president of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott in return, the British newspaper, The Guardian reported.
"I would have wanted Amazon to take this step earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," the Senate said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
“Wikileaks acts illegally, monsterly and without scrupules, putting our national security in danger and life in danger all over the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks spread the contents of stolen documents.”
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is searched for by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is listed on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to information published by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where it is.
The cyber-activist has constantly qualified as intrigues orchestrated by its detractors for the prosecutions committed against it by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats were made against the site.
Calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange.
That is why Assange is particularly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That’s why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson responded clearly to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of the Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the official for the revelations made by Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, Governing Chairman Stephen Harper, apparently ironically, told TV that Assange should be "killing" and that Obama could "use a drone".
Meanwhile, a controversy began between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, U.S. President’s spokeswoman Barack Obama, called the fact that Mr. Asange required the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual owner of a website,” Gibbs says.
“Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website.”
The U.S. government now completely transfers to the test base the protection of its databases.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Center for the Anti-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for fighting escapes.
Mr. Travers is responsible for implementing the "needed structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks’ revelations.
"We have made everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, spokeswoman of the State Department.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Iceland
At the Gelato University of Bologna, ice confistors are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiative course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
Ice cream and ice machine.
The ice cream, i.e. in German the slightly demoded ice confisher, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the glass refrigerated with a spatula, arranges it in the gauf and then begins to sell it.
To know, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to learn more about the ice cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice creams founded the ice university in 2003 so that ice creams from its machinery can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers has been very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special lessons are also offered on chocolate ice and extends for several days. Similarly, practical sessions are organized in the private ice cream.
In the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants come from 19 countries from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of artistic education from California, is a featuring the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a European product of quality in the country of the Industrial Iceland in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a corporate management advisor and she wants, after a few years, to draw a few individual things from this career experienced for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man originating in Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice creams.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari explains first to the participants the ideal features of perfect ice.
It is crucial not only the good taste, but also the soybean flexibility and the good consistency.
Nevertheless, Luciano does not forget the cerise on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still maintains a sacred dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano verses the basic ingredients such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
It then opens a robbery installed on the machine: it releases a pasteurized white base cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice by using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can we give free course to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warns against allowing himself to be mistaken by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only "made from natural ingredients" may, despite this, uses stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, of guar seed milk obtained from guar shark.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only you need to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it will collapse and the client will crush nothing but ice granules.
Some changes to the basic mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the supermarket’s fruit radius or confisseries.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to refill you with dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"Always, you should just try."
Both in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Whether in the ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when added to it, the base of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must move to the use of ice machinery.
Luciano invites them to make four types of ice cream from time to time: vanilla, chocolate, moka and nose with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
Different types of ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purified: from the point of view of the taste, this is not absolutely better.
Ice cream does not necessarily involve the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of nuts.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture correctly relieves the taste of a ice,” Luciano says.
Ice production is a calculation exercise: if you use fishing pure with lots of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruits (vineyards are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the wheat moth).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations.
The production of ice no longer requires, as before, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the automatic mass manufacturing machine that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it onctuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, lightweight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbers fruit pure from the head to the feet and, thus, slaughters his study companions when the control of the colossal mixing bolt escapes him.
Mr. Luciano believes that "a similar incident risks to occur during each course: it's just a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry experienced the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nuclearized the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech expert group which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well-respected," said Christoph Then, CEO of Testbiotech in Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the President of the Efsa Group for Genetically Modified Plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has cooperated decisively in the preparation of the EFS test requirements for genetically modified plants and is thus clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms formulated by Mr. Then.
The drafted requirements correspond to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus carry the brand of the industry that would basically be controlled by the authorities established in Parma in Italy.
This is already the second time Testbiotech denounced a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking Efsa official has recently joined the Swiss agro-food group Syngenta without condition or transitional periods.
A short time ago, even Central Germany Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relationships between the European Union authority responsible for control and the industrial lobby, which raised suspicions both from the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, the EFSA does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
One opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of the Efsa are not forbidden to contact this business sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This body is considered a neutral forum that groups experts, among other things, in the field of science, industry and politics, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
“We want to know, for example, what are the effects of genetically modified corn in the field,” Mr. Then says.
The current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Mr. Then asks on your accused.
This is also the point of view of Ms. Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are still hardly researchers who are not associated with societies.
According to companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms Hilbeck says "the industry controls security research."
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell has acquired a total of about 400 pounds.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart station with her back tube.
There was a manifew.
He was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and began to demolished a large part of the northern wings.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands of people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of the Stuttgart central station into a underground station that will cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the protests led to the ceasefire of construction work.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheim's Muschelkalk (coquillier calcaire) is a tender and gross pavement that was badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Ostfildern.
A few fragments were found.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He says with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that by decoating it to the chest, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to an ancient ammunition deposit of the French Army in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolity occurring in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were concassed or if they disappeared in the discharge," he said in his office located in a hut, which once was a guard station.
He tells him that he was offended and threatened when in September newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern wings to the demolishment company.
But he negotiated for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything at all to oppose the demolity.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using stones.
Around 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the 80 kg weighing stone parallellepipeds, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a reminder while also hoping to be able to rebuild it.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full charges of a truck.
About half is still in the forest, the rest of which has been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscaped gardeners, Particulars.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the safe and remorse.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb-band plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"It was not the summer of this political component."
He enters his car all the land, turning around his vast 20-hectares empire.
Later, he studied biology before he was interested in computing and eventually became a career.
And an amateur of stones.
It stores 40,000 tons.
They gather treasures all over Germany.
He claims that he is the largest merchant of ancient stones.
He's refrained.
Sand stones sculpted with art are placed on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes through the forest.
It shows a number of fingers: Red sand stone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Please translate."
The Parallel Epidemy was formerly part of the Neckarstadion Trinity in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, Cannstatt’s travertine from the police prefecture, the red-carved granite from St. Blasien Cathedral, the tuf from Heilbronn Hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sugar!
When Mr. Rongen believes that the stones were once sculpted by hand and moved with the help of simple palans and carriages pulled by cows, he becomes totally respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put in pieces."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this carrier today employs 14 people. In addition, stone tutors, a sculptor, a forger, a glass souffle and a gardener have been installed in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the waste recycler.
In the future, he must go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Fighting talents to conquer high potentials
The computer experiences a great deal of affluence.
16 students are trained to buy small loaves of salmon, tomato sauce and white-mangers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen Car Maker invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some kind of ideas competitions, they have to talk professionally about the car of the future with VW designers, and, in the past, know the Volkswagen company.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body in the competition to denial better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit graduates as good as possible in the amphibians before they arrive on the employment market and are shortened by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we are trying to detect the exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and loyalty to them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Brauschweig Technical University, the automotive group amadure the talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares pens, beans and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the timetable of professional training and young talent students’ jobs; she shows them the ways to access the group’s stage.
It is Nico Selle from the Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come in contact with this industry and gain experience."
"In the Volkswagen Group, he can meet students, look closer at serious candidates and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to Mr. selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What’s happening again is the offensive with which we’re trying to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was placed rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much more open.
In the goods of the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by making a selection of a Cyrillic candidate.
But they must honour their reliability and, above all, shorten the high-qualified workforce.
These are especially the graduates from engineering threads that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers were unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI, the vacuum of engineering positions will continue to expand.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunt on behalf of KPMG, an auditing firm, accounting expertise and advisory.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of rally paper where competitors must find their path using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year so that they will travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can additionally visit KPMG’s subsidiaries and know the company.
The one who has to participate in it decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for searching for high potentials in universities are increasingly important.
"We want to get out of the lot thanks to the cruise race."
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
“Until today, we have been in contact with all those who participated in a similar action last year.”
“Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to quickly address their applications to our company,” he says.
Except for direct amaturing on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite classic way by participating in professional fairs where they offer brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional salons."
"For example, at the solar technology salon," said Sitha Stübe, Human Resource Director at Solarworld, a photovoltaic panel manufacturer.
This company located in Bonn employs approximately 1,500 people in Germany.
Mrs. Stübe knows about the relief problem.
Currently, 35 posts are contested on the company’s website.
"Now, it's very difficult to take vacant positions."
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he says?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with different higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional stages or write his final study project at us."
Cheap advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
That’s why the company is trying to make its advertising by exerting other qualities: customized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"So often, a large group can't do this," supports Ms. Stübe, staff chief.
For a long time, money has no longer played the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotional opportunities are other decisive factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld occupies 55th place among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table of German employers.
To this end, it examines employees on their level of satisfaction in relation to their work and context while considering the employee’s framework conditions.
Ms. Stübe's staff manager hopes that this placement will increase the image of the company with employers.
“I think candidates are particularly concerned with external evaluations regarding a potential employer,” she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, first of all, to take internal measures.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to pass through his own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own employee.
"Satisfied employees form the best messengers."
When treating employees well and identifying themselves with the company, they only make their employer’s advertising with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler said.
Obama Breaks New Oil Forages
There will be no new oil forages in the Gulf of Mexico on the coast of Florida, Southeast State of the United States, over the years to come.
The Washington government has pronounced a ban Equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even on the coast of the Atlantic coast, new forages remain for the moment forbidden.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced this Wednesday.
This is the explosion in April of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" which is the origin of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with the accident that cost eleven employees life and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector, had indicated he was willing to authorize new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, supporters of this solution want to reduce US dependence on foreign countries as regards oil supply.
The question of knowing who bears the responsibility of the devastating black mary in the golf has not been, until now, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, facing several billion compensation claims, is at the center of charges.
An investigation committee created by Obama must present its current conclusions in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar raised the ice cream of the forage decreed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter control measures and stricter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many allegations of corruption, is currently undergoing deep reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would remove profitable tax niches from gas and oil groups.
The actors in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of power in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The government's goal is to put a quick-growing brake in the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current survey conducted in the sector by the BDO audit firm, before the pronounced forging ban on Wednesday.
In addition, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with regulations."
Investments agreed in new support projects have been delayed to new order, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in the rivers is brown oiled; it emits a smell similar to that in the gasoline: Due to a escape, billions of liters of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live in stealing, corruption, and refining of oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t be exhausted,” the environmental activist launches to journalists to calm them: “You still have enough oil in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has attempted to photograph a young man in the boiling water to the chest, as well as the fat tray around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the brightness of the arc in the color of the sky.
It cannot be noticed that the underground is filled with brown peppers of crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells her that she had previously collected crevettes by whole seals here.
But in the meantime, the calm waters were completely sharp.
Five years ago, an enormous amount of oil has been thrown out of an oil tube that exploded in the immense marijuana.
The fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to rain for six hours to reach fishing waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire scope of ravages jumps to the eyes when crossing the mangrove marrows crossed through water streams.
Instead of a clear water, the motorboat sews a brown cradling water. Anyone who blows his hand removes all oil coverage.
The roots of the mangrove rise from the ground like a pavement. The isolated palm leaves their palms sharply.
In vain, the clouds of birds are searched, as we usually encounter in wet areas: Since the outboard engine stops, a fantasy silence is at this paradise that once looks like a service station by the smell it leaves.
“What’s happening here is war against the environment,” Celestine Akpobari said in a sad air: “Our life is characterized by a permanent danger of health.”
The comparison of wars is done.
The region in which the Ogonis live is a battlefield located for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.
Today, the return to Ogoni is forbidden to this company: while more than 2 million black gold barils are pumped daily thanks to more than 5,000 drilling barils and 7,000 kilometers of oil pipes throughout the Delta region, three times large as Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are inexplorable for this situation, because the situation is inexplorable.
Every few hundred meters rise in the water of steel trees like strange sculptures: the heads of boiling holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees".
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are corrupted by corrosion until detection.
Akpobari estimates that a borehead of this kind falls in pieces from time to time, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have spread over the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that flowed into the sea during the super-oil accident "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, one of the largest environmental disasters in Alaska.
Who must bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, sabotage and syphonization of oil pipes are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of drilling heads and perforated oil pipes as the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner rejected the Shell group to apply in Nigeria essentially less strict safety standards than anywhere else in the world: Only the driver failure rate is "more higher than lighter."
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, looks like a abandoned workshop, full of camels and installed in the outdoors: they are completely nude and covered with camels to the neck.
A shiny fire under one of the many tons that sometimes are connected to the pipes, sometimes sparked without a pattern on the site must be recovered: a small clandestine refinery.
We heat crude oil in the tunnel for several hours, says Michael, the team’s head.
First, the fuel enters a container passing through pipes, then at the end of the conducting drops of cerosene falls and finally gets diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-liter Diesel fots per day: “This reports us 34,000 Naira,” about $22.
Delta residents benefit from the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producer country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than that of just 40 centimeters per liter of Diesel: Because they buy their raw materials for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" that put the oil pipeline network in percussion across the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million liters of crude oil throughout the Delta of Niger.
Only a small part of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: the networks of organized crime that also include its members of senior politicians and military, loading the share of the lion in tanks and bragging it on the global market.
The militant Akpobari believes that the debate on whether environmental disaster or rather subversive activities should be attributed to the population or the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the life of fishers were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor illegal furniture and refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni’s relations especially with Shell have become so worse that it was only a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
“It’s a great time for you to taste,” the robust oil worker announces.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at least they will offer them pots of wine.
Even soldiers mostly from the north of the country hear enjoying the raw material like all Nigerians.
"At every point of view, this shit has made our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in the A380 reactors
The A380 is apparently suffering from a major security problem.
By examining a device that carried out an emergency landing, the investigators found a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
Earlier November, airbus passengers of Quantas had apparently had more chances so far: During its investigation, the Australian air safety authority found that some A380 aircraft's reactors had a serious security problem, and warned against a possible construction failure.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue crashes and leaks at the level of the oil pipeline connection, according to a position taken by the ATSB administration on Thursday.
It could have led to a catastrophic failure of reactors.
Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 aircraft of the A380 series are involved.
The airbus of Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4, in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now engaged trials against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court with its headquarters in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal measures against the company.
Quantas Director, Alan Joyce, said his company would claim damage to the incident in early November.
Parts were removed and the portable surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the result of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that other safety tests will be carried out on supercomposers that are also equipped with reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of its aircraft, Quantas had landed all its fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilisated three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor by precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the largest line plane in the world.
Snowfall throughout the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered with white: In one night, the snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people have died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grelotte: By ice temperatures, almost the whole republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, leading to chaos in many cities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per location.
Traffic is highly restricted on several highways and on many roads.
At the national A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they could not end the snow that ceased to accumulate.
In addition, violent raids broke the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the raz-de-marriage will take place under the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above the normal.
Snow mass on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather warning plant Meteomedia announced the level of violet warning was announced in Saxony Switzerland: in fact, it’s the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars stayed locked at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have announced serious road disturbances.
On the A2 highway, snow and wind led to a interruption of circulation and caused bubbles.
In Thuringe, snowfalls touched the A4 and A9 highways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious rail traffic disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringe and north of Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees falling on the railways, containers or destroyed needles.
In Saxe, we had to interrupt the interregional transportation of Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train to Munich had to stop his journey.
Pumpers and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and beverages.
Snow winds scanned the roads.
The snowfalls have led to many flight cancellations at the main airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesperson and flight information, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
A spokeswoman of Fraport said 40 flights had already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service there.
It is true that there are no more passengers arrested at the airport, despite that only 400 beds are available there.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level passage.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was stuck at a step-by-step because the vehicle was installed there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, so the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car took a tone on a sliding shoe in Aschaffenburg.
However, weatherologists announce good news: Snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will turn to light raffles.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be distressed by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees per location.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin tours.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution seeks buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring up to 500 million euros.
The Deutsche Bank just came to decorate the group’s headquarters: The twin towers in the Business Quarter have been modernized; while the bankers had to return to their former service place.
Later, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the cost of renovation and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we're checking whether it's more interesting to take care of our own homes or sell them, and to rebuild them later."
This is why the largest financial institution in Germany has already been seated, shortly afterwards.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the dual tours for a amount of EUR 272 million from the owners of capital funds, which had subsequently been refundable.
The transformations towards energy optimization have, according to some indications, increased about 200 million euros.
Of course, a sale would report a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, rebaptized between the "Green Towers", at about 500 million euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a bank fund or an independent investor.
Thousands of people cry for minors who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have had a thought for the funeral minors who have been declared dead as a result of several explosions occurring in a mine.
We have not yet been able to lift the bodies because the security situation of the damaged puddle continues to be prejudiced.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age is between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the damaged hut, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions followed, no rescue teams were able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
Until now, the bodies could not be lifted up.
Today, parents and friends have organized a celebration for the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a sunrise in Greymouth south of the New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors buried, 29 tables were installed on which the names, casks and lamps could be seen.
Personal photos and effects, including clothing and surf boards, also had their place.
The flags have been placed in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants to the Memorial party that New Zealand has fed the hope that minors will return to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the caves, said he could not refuse to accept his son's death until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative party.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion of November 19.
The rescuers began to fire a fire inside the coal mine of the Southern Island of New Zealand.
Police chief Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when explosive gas masses are moving, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising", the warrior's echo.
To what audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well think by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) possessing only one eye is made prisoner; he gets rid of his bow and, with nearly overnatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, brutally waiting for those without bloody intestine, just because our hero uses bad-assana methods.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the bourgeoisie does not say any word on his true name. Even the other characters let escape, at least, in the course of one or two sentences, a few terrible shouting of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and we celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decoration of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal for more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travellings.
When a film targets several target groups, it is unfortunate that they exclude each other.
Winding Refn has been considered, since the appearance of "Pusher", his trilogy concerning the narcotics dealer, full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant knowledge or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test film.
Most of the sympathizers of the art film must experience the horror faced by the brain that spreads around and around the intestines.
The amateurs of action films die boring, when the bourgeoisie embarks, for reasons that freely can be interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship to Jerusalem; they are nodged for an eternal time by calm and noise before the crew arrives in America and continues to be yours.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" found no film distributor in Germany and that it only exists in the DVD format.
This is especially due to the beautiful pictures of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the picture of a palpitant film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It’s not dialogue in this film or coherent action, everything is ambience, a fierce dream transformed into film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn barely gives her a moment of relaxation and slowly cut her throat with glacial images and a lustful sound band, but especially with an inexcusable hatred that jails the characters' heart.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully next to the bow, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger.
More than anything else, the borgen hero whose mobiles are never known, but who return from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily the allies turning into warriors, maybe is sent by the devil himself.
It represents the burning, but maybe also, nothing but for those who are, in any way, burning.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, which for the purpose is aging, enthusiasm and surprise.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take position on this subject, even less subject to the agency's controls.
In the night from 5 to 6 September 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I hunting aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates River; the largest city nearby is 30 km away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name is in the IAEA's documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallellipide, dissimulated in a valley marked by the absence of electricity.
According to a US Information Service briefing, the CIA, dated late April 2008, the common reactor known as the neighbouring neighborhood, el-Kibar, would be well capable of producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
In contrast, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video containing flooded satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probability of the location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant representing a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the nuclear power plant of Yongbyon.
In addition, she presented pictures showing the building nearby, or even the inside of it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be launched, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have barely more information than at the time, and even, with time, the mystery has become more and more apparent.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memory that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had few indices showing that the country was developing a "active nuclear weapons program".
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and only talk about a "suspected reactor", even if they consider the CIA's presentation as "plausible".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked about how he is concerned with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer affirming that the IAEA had enough documents to ask questions.
The Syrians have certainly removed the downfalls of the "unused military building" and conducted a methodical alignment of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images of commercial providers showing the moment that followed the attack directly. it seems that the latter are more distant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never implemented a secret atomic program and that it has never built a reactor.
Damascus claims that uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles by calling it irrevocable.
Since then, dama refuses any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the el-Kibar site and refuse access to the building’s downfalls destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a silence obscure.
Confirmating the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: “We will never make comments on this.”
This is how the investigation on this case has been extended since June 2008 without achieving a result and that it "has become increasingly a serious issue of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a high-ranking Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna, ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to achieve progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have a "functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have neither indicated which facilities it is here, nor is it their function or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the journal "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as well as the name of neighboring cities.
The Washington Institute for Science and International Security (International Institute for Science and International Security) identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would very likely be one of the suspected objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to the IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, Syrians are afraid that the inspection group would actually be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is an information provided by U.S. secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photographs, indicating that vehicles have shipwrecked between the three sites and the stone parallelpipede to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve for fuel production".
It would have no "indications of sensitive activities", such as enrichment and recycling of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are strictly plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: from where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium necessary for the manufacture of the bomb would be separated later.
It is unknown whether the records, which could hide traces of high value, have been stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land-loaded trucks disappear, no one will have information on the storage site of the records.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria would have examined in 1998 the al-Tibni salt mine, located only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it can match the storage of radioactive waste.
By analyzing recent satellite photographs on behalf of the famous Jane’s Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Nevertheless, satellite photographs show that Syria carried out terrace work on the three suspected sites and moved huge containers when the IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to eliminate suspicions.
In the diplomatic environment, IAEA has spent several months preparing a plan for inspections to be carried out. This plan should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. Only invested time shows the great interest of the inspectors in this case.
In the meantime, Damascus also ended with this proposal.
A year ago, if western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, says Glyn Davies, US ambassador, who has mentioned for a few months what is known under the name of the atomic inspections, one of the most powerful means of putting in control of its Agen.
The Director of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of a "option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented there are no desire to see the situation seeing an escalation.
On the other hand, like the diplomat who gives it to reflect: "It would be good for that, if they finally find nothing."
Love in times of war
It's okay since Angelina Jolie made her starts in the summer as a director.
She wrote the script itself: it is a love story between a woman originating in Bosnia and a man of Serbia.
We don’t know anything more about this story, but it’s enough to cause distress.
A persistent rumors indicate that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian bow during the war of Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations have immediately protested, and in response, some scheduled touring sequence in Sarajevo have been moved in the last minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the film is toured in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic from the organization of women victims of war addressed Angelina Jolie a correspondence through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and asked her to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat, but a few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but these refused this offer.
“The meeting must take place in Bosnia,” Hasecic says.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says long enough about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic’s organization has subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted a return permission to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it is not known why it was not subsequently arrived despite that permission.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, but that it is by making a lot of effort to be informed of the Yugoslav conflict; she supports that she wants to exert the terrible consequences of the war and enables all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains wave about content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew one another long before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported into the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
This is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bow".
That Jolie's film began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, so expressed by Jolie, is "unfair and based on wrong information."
Now, only Hollywood fans can give him peace: by illegally putting this scenario into the Net, like many others before.
Let's shoot!
Tonight, everything goes well with the Irish people again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overwhelms visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy in the background of a strong music, they tremble their feet.
Baileyu-Pub of Cork in southern Ireland is vibrant because players launch and manage to make table tennis balls fall at a distance of three meters in opponent team beer gobelets.
This strange show is called "beer-pong". The winner empoche 500 Euro plus an aircraft ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the World Cup of Beer-pong.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer-reserved, these two behaviors really don’t go well together.
However, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun, turn away from the tremendous issue, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his projects. In January, he will lead employment interviews in New Zealand.
“I have a strange feeling,” he says.
"The native country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she dealt with her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," the young man said smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner tried their luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social assistant, resides in Sydney, and her brother Colin is now an IT consultant in London.
Young people go away: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even plan a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these predictions are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that of which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irish have enjoyed a great assault, sadness now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis affects mostly young Irish, well-trained, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
Job loss and social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But in the meantime, three in ten people under thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times publishes abundantly letters from readers written by young immigrants, complaining: "In Ireland, everything goes to the derivative."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities will go and our country will go a whole generation.”
"The last one to leave turns the light off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, chairman of the Irish Students Association, sees a darker future because the government just throws the dust into the eyes and offers no future prospects for young people.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades crambled from a practical unpaid stage to another.
She says her greatest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressed thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively address this topic.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" salon which offers full support on the theme "working abroad".
“But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the level of professional hierarchy,” the official said.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
Since there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany.
A fashion house just out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country as he participates in an additional job so that he can complete refunding the credit contracted to build his home in his home country.
“The situation is already a little crazy,” he says by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I don’t live virtually anymore.”
He climbs out of a shameful laughter through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-cared front gardens, expensive cars of large brands are stationed on the pathways of access.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, financed to 100 percent by credit.
“That were moments of madness, no doubt the money was easy,” he says.
Is he afraid to see everything falling out because of credit?
O'Donovan reflects a moment, recalls hot tea and says, "I don't have children to be careful and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
“No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island,” he said.
Working for a while abroad isn’t what can happen worse, perhaps that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughed and then talked about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, just.”
This idea likes Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
In his palmarèse, he has already had a few years of work in London, which is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that concerns you very well in the last days: the celebration to be organized at its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He fears that he will not be able to turn into a goodbye.
“But not a lot of emotions,” he said, drinking a long beer.
"Alloy, it looks worrisome."
"Let's call it a goodbye evening, all relaxing, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, just like that of the private business.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows attitude changes in the region.
Two related elements come from the results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the pretty sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries over the South Pacific circle (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy grew up after undergoing a significant decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Table 2).
About 44% of the respondents in the region expressed themselves satisfied with the way democracy in their country was working in practice; it was the same figure as last year but with a significant increase of 25% in 2001 (graph 3)
About 34% said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a significant increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America broke out support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many American countries have suffered only a short recession and have benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased slightly only in 2009 and again fell to 32% this year.)
But the mood varies significantly from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of his outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are a widely shared feeling of progress.
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
It is only the second time since the survey has begun that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have quoted crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or one of their relatives have been victims of a criminal act over the past year; however, this figure has declined to 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance reflects rising support for private enterprises and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
About 58% believe that the market economy is the only system to make their country developed, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela’s respondents are in this opinion (and 80% supports the private company); although their left president, Hugo Chavez, owns many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of the respondents (from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, decreased by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An unclean vote
No one was expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than outsiders who wanted to help the damaged country and flooded in fear.
Voting boxes and a new voting, voting bulletins dispersed in the droplets, voting offices and intimidations were presented
Voting offices will open late in the evening.
Many Hatitians, including many who were moved after the January earthquake, would go to the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them finally abandoned.
A dozen of presidential candidates, of which several alleged favourites, have denied fraud and have requested the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, senior official of the United Nations in Haiti, considers the event "a fairly good election in many ways".
observers of the United States Organization and the Caribbean Community have cautiously stated that they “do not believe that these irregularities, whether serious or serious, have necessarily invalidated the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are debtors to René Preval, an unpopular president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on December 7.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
Any hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, resigned from their initial call for the vote to be declared zero.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support in voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reach the second round.
With an angry cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, we were afraid that participation would be.
At the same time, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
The game is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, obviously, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a public sympathy wave that has improved its approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a successful campaign for a second mandate during a next year's election could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently in grief, according to which she would abandon or not the intransigement of her deceased husband, predecessor and former political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets underestimating tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend additional income at their disposal.
The government of Fernández lost its majority at Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has been shaken in disruption after Mr. Kirchner's death of a heart attack on 27 October.
Some of the dissident members of the peronist movement to power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (when a parliamentary hit one of his pairs and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to argue,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President even greater maneuver margin to spend at will.
The economy is largely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions salaries see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his role in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purified the INDEC, the statistical office, which conducted fake statistics on official inflation.
Can Ms Fernández moderate these policies now?
She called for talks between private companies and trade unions leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit salary increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by the high global prices of agricultural exports from Argentina.
However, inflation broke down inch growth due to a strong devaluation in 2002.
This may be why Ms Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with bonders who had rejected a previous forced restructuring of debt for which Argentina had not regulated its expiry in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF monitoring, as it is usual.
But last month, the Minister of Economics, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to INDEC healthcare.
It is unclear whether Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which kirchnerism is very proud.
When the Argentinas return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have reflected.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether, without noise, to reject many policies of her husband.
Half-hour for China
The Taiwanese voters were aimed at a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother located on the other side of the neighbourhood?
More than 7.5 million voters appeared on 27 November, 70% of eligible people, to elect the mayors and municipal advisers in five urban districts, as part of what is considered to be a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for the feelings of the continent, having used innovative business links, including a free partial trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
I succeeded in the test, but it was just.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three out of five mayors, he failed to win a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan’s full independence, won nearly 50% of all votes for the KMT by 45%.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event disclosed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including tapage campaign truck and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal clothing.
A compulsory mysterious murder attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate at the evening of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, wounded and killing a passer.
Strangely, he was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said the murder had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion on the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of elections was China.
It was surprised to see how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its fact independence and hates the military threat of China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid stopping its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also abstained from attaching the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
Mr. Ma, on the other hand, claimed a confirmation to see if his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government continues to provide commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to defeat Taiwan, back to the barrier.
China has not wasted time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start from the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has re-invented.
Two years ago, he was wrong: his former head, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to jail due to allegations of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates saw the day under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP made everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai was greeted as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing their best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews may take place without preconditions.
Mrs. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has a "reliable alternative" compared to Mr. Ma's fast-paced approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he said PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to bribe the Presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be difficult to choose among its potential candidates.
The KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were low; despite a vertigineous economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its impopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the expansion of the fox among rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT said his office and local antennas will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the convergence is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Nominations to the Grammy Awards: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
To do it at the request of a president, and people are required to get acquainted with it.
Esperanza Spalding, 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was handheld by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a great nomination in the category of "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not release more than three albums before the recording; which "sets the public identity of this artist."
His 2010 ambitious album, "Chamber Music Society", has certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful hand and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one pointed line at Spalding compared to the latest success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent of these fulfiling productions in the nearest Gra Awards for the electors.
In addition, the Grammy Awards voters honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a tour on a revigorant emotion of a recording that was one of the first favorites last year.
Among these Ier, "Moody 4B" of the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favored by New Orleans's rocky voice and frequent guest to HBO's "Tree" was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is also strongly linked to a certain merger with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Secret Society of Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has won a few well earned recognitions in the large category together; in competition with Billy Childs’ rich chamber-jazz Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a beautiful example of the hand of this bassist.
Nomination of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers around the world.
In the head of the nominations, cites "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominations with connections to Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work ordered by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the Los Angeles-based composer, Avner Dorman, is also in lice for a prize.
The classical nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
One category for the classic producer of the year brings in five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphony No. 3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and "Dreamhouse" of Chicago" and "Sy" by "Sy" by "Synergy" by "Divery".
In the category of the opera, the nominations are "Lulu" of Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love of Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the German Symphony-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Orchestra and "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the Choir's.
The composers in place for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition include Pärt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 took its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solitary instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he soon wrote the 15-minute work specifically for the Avi Avital mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York City.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of gammes and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old orchestra leader Pierre Boulez received a nomination in the category of orchestra performances for leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who have received a nomination, are the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only soloist vocalist nominations; here are: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixture category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for his recording "Rose: My Life, My Song"
The project of the Temecula mosque won the approval of the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
The critics took part in the project claiming that it was promoting both terrorism and trafficking.
But the Commissioners stated Wednesday evening that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aestheticly impressive.
"A lot of people have come to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahamas, you mention it," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as an American citizen."
"This shows that justice wins it."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very strong voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and lasted to almost midnight with, most of the time, people pronouncing themselves for or against the center, at the time of speech almost also distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the journal’s website.
“There’s no more America,” a spokesman wrote.
"This is another planet of singers with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also caused protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, the place of September 11, 2001 attacks committed in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her companionship of 135 co-existent families in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two minarets and be 43 feet above.
It would occupy a 4.32 hectares site on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral high school.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being a truly "strange" form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. from the University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report in the online edition of Thursday of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers found that the bacteria discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"We are wondering what is still possible," Ariel Anbar D. from the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in searching for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to act in biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science, Open University, United Kingdom, Milton Key.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It wasn't a fortunate discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus it speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to phosphorus."
"Consequently, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
“But the arsenic is different enough so it does not work exactly like phosphorus; it enters inside and, in some way, rubbish the work of our biochemical machine,” Anbar explained.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenal instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenal can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or another planet or moon where arsenal is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Deputy Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has never shown that it could walk.
Arsenal was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; so, researchers have issued the assumption that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning,” Foster said, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibits dogs were found in Compton
The other two exhibit dogs on four robbers outside a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles County announced on Thursday.
The four exhibit dogs - two akitas and two gallo pembroke corgis - disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, the authorities announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
“The good news is that dogs are going well,” Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to tell exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood and what circumstances of their discovery were.
"A investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say that," Whitmore said.
"We're following orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were gathered Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a pet refuge in Downey County.
Sheriff's deputy officers found the truck and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month female - were healthy and safe, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were carried away until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach national "AKC/Eukanuba" championship, where they intended to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in other tests scheduled in the days before the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek told Times Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops in the dog exhibition tour of nearly one month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked at the motel.
They often stay in the motels and carry their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer dog, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spine - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, thicker forrue, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a bit open windows so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's stealing on Tuesday at 6 p.m.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted micropush to identify them.
It is unclear whether a prize was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, MGM restructuring is waiting only for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to restart to zero.
A New York bankruptcy federal judge officially leased the "prepacked" plan by creditors that about $5 billion of debt would be deleted; opening the way to the entertainment company, who has 86 years of existence, to focus his efforts on producing and distributing films and television broadcasts.
With the decision of Thursday that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, there is no legal obstacle in front of MGM to fall into a flood under the head of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors-general of what will be an improved studio.
The staff will be returned to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under license by the Investment Bank, which itself hits $75 million, and should be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the studio began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was engaged in advising the management on how to place its finances as it had no means of paying interests of $300 million per year.
In August, Director-General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and a recreation expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and satisfy more than 140 studio creditors took much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the sale of auctions attracted few tenderers, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again while the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive several million dollars prizes for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which collected $375,000 a month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million “success premium”.
Barber and Birnbaum plans to restart the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and launch an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released in 2012.
They also intend to co-financing two Hobbit-based films with Warner Bros.
The studio has to conclude a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its role in these two films, which must be performed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM’s debt, has tried to fusion the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your budget gifts balanced
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is IPAD, maybe followed by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bicycles at $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearls jumping, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your budget gifts balanced.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are peach toys of the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when pressing them on the stomach.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start pushing, you can no longer stop.
To combine the dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Inspired by Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-inch animated puppy plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel blocking.
Children who have eaten the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 80s, you will remember Alpha, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and older), with a backpack filled with questionnaire cards designed to transform a car hike into a session with a self-correction and a valve classroom.
If you are unreliable when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not educate as effectively as Explore Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major review of the Leapster range, with a lighter and more recent screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses an iTunes system to offer games and electronic books and is equipped with an SD card entry that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks hardly bigger than a lamp box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing online blocks before the time runs, which is ideal for an impromptu orthograph contest.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
It may be roulette patins or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest micro-robot button.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrant silicone pastes in random directions.
It’s fun to make a block labyrinth to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentum passage in the mouth of our dog.
Provide a softer side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin argued a place of the city as a city sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nervous burdens, emitting low orders with a military authority.
He wanted female members of chengguan - imposing public order officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and repentance of violence - to give some impression to a set of spectators.
"Don't be right!"
"Be damned!"
Show them, he said, "How beautiful girls look like!"
Four girls who had barely passed teenageness in white gloves, dressed with identical olive color pants and dressed up on your guard.
Four pairs of black talon shoes, linked to the rule.
Four perfectly treated chapels made to the top of the hair attached to a blue and white node.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Tang, with dedain.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of the city inspectors of China.
A city requires all new recruits to have a degree of higher education.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them in a strong way: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had circled an incontrollable snack car, throwing black looks, firmly for half an hour, until the co-porter returned his business and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the middle of the city of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, gall and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty looking at this underground city brigade in China
And for this reason, the critics will say.
Unlike police, these officers are only authorised to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict the news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in the province of Hubei killed an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against waste discharge.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, demolished and online, describes how to effectively defeat criminals without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a paste co-porter was abandoned with a brain injury after a bride with five officers.
A video game of violence, available by download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained at the attack of street sellers.
"Chengguan marked the government," last year China Daily, a national publication, regretted, after a second questionnaire on tactics.
The journal claims a "real complete cleaning."
The skeptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district passed an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real tasks or were only a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of the two.
The district’s announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and “the five characteristics of the face in the right order.”
They must have a size higher than the average, either 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
26-year-old retirement is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years old.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a near-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they fit; it is about size, weight, face characteristics, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "indoor qualities."
Women in Chengguan are like flower vessels, he said, adding: “In addition to being vessels, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not follow this description.
However, he noted that height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sexes.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the characteristics of the face.
That this means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or disabilities should not apply.
"We can't let a person who is bowing or a boss come to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has pommeled toys with a finely incurred mouth.
She does not consider the appreciation of her appearance as a sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked a debuted air.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old co-worker in the fountain, said, "Our work is to present the city's image."
They are not opposed to limiting their mandate, they said, because they feed larger career ambitions than just hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen ambulance merchants who move fast on foot or bike, trying to sell as little bread or tofu bags as possible before taking the escape.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We have already told you several times," said Ms Xu while a seller fled foot, temporarily abandoning his bike carriage in nozzles.
Agents describe their functions rather than as monotones than ardues.
“It’s almost the same thing every day,” said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who studied marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibits of animation against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan’s capital, rebelled after spreading false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
In one night, more than a dozen police officers and chengguan officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were kidnapped or fired.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two packs of houses at Baoguang Square, where female officers patroled this morning, more than 50 people gathered in the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the trottoir rather than in a store, as it imposes them.
The owner of the motorcycle cried to the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, on the silent face, broke a road to their vehicle and went at all speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge turned back to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators – men aged 40 years or older – just play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain a ceramic image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li of a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, the audience begins.”
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys in the Ministry of Justice have raised criminal charges on Senator John Ensign, resulting from a case related to an assistant from an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the woman's husband, Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most severe legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate to the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case made big national titles last year and damaged his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" by the decision, resulting from a year's investigation.
The Senate may still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Ministry of Justice had “informed that Senator Ensign was no longer subject to investigation and that he had no intention of keeping any charges against him in this case.”
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many lawyers of ethics outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a profitable lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a cashier during a Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funding donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them; according to documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law of lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the lobbying door.
According to the evidence made public, “there appears to be a face-to-face proof of a complot to violate and substantial violation of the law of the turning door,” Stanley Brand, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in the defense of customers in an investigation by the government.
Although the ministry judge refused to explain the reasoning led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the ministry seemed to be treated with political prosecutions after a number of high-level convictions by his public integrity department in the case of Tesla, including the decision-making of Steven last year.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking weapons, said Melanie Sloan, Citizens’ Director-General for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-rating government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief attorney of Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up the next day, saying that the ministry did not seek charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers' team had collaborated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the Senator, as his office reaffirmed in a statement Wednesday, "have acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the parquet.
“I’m not pleased to enter the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to leave an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethical group, affirming that the payment of $96,000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign to Hampton violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission said it had no evidence enough to prove that money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, a major company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign’s cabinet chief John Lopez communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he “smartly” the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transport Secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the case came into effect last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his position as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago he was intending to brigate a third mandate in the Senate.
In announcement that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said that the Senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is delighted to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half dozen of them were beating away in the rows of the audience room.
They sent every minute of terrible reports on Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages about the prosecution and children attached to their bed in a house that was burnt.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes' widely followed trial, which was recognized guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members in Connecticut, should result in an official end in which the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
However, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already filed evidence to the court that excuse appeals, which are likely to occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use of Twitter journalists - have created a "circ atmosphere", so widespread and instantly saturated with fire details that the jury has been wrongly influenced by the public's passions.
The demand could lead appeal judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this in the process; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in hearing rooms infringes the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer at Hayes, chief lawyer.
Judge Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court laconically rejected the claims in the last week’s judgment, claiming that the media were “carefully controlled” and there was no evidence that the jury had been animated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the question.
Call courses have recognized for decades that the media coverage of famous cases can raise questions about the equity of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment dated, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnaval atmosphery in the trial" for the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television broadcasting and the film "The Fucking".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts to review Mr. Hayes' sentence a half-century later may be curious given the argument that new rules may be needed to manage the means of communication of hearing rooms, inconceivable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the trials of great confusion, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford School of Law who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from hearing rooms could allow more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many other lawyers described by Mr. Hayes, which may have been discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them macabra photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury said they were frightened by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years old.
Defence lawyers claim that they will also contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will claim that the judge has unfairly expelled one of the jury, who had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and that he has abusively put pressure on a verdict by making an unusual decision to bring the jury to a week to deliberate.
The jury was not seized.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates to be governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media ceased to attract the flames of the emotion of the case.
“The daily blowback of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the justice palace,” the lawyers wrote, “was nothing like what had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level.”
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the affirmation that the news were more instantaneous than the reports sent slower was a ludistic view that would aggravate the Court's policy governing the media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers have stated that the appeal courses were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes needed an adaptation by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court’s decision that had reversed Dr. Sheppard’s condemnation due to the media coverage of the trial and they stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represented by Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilization approach climbings?
After a campaign marked by invasive and negative, a minimum of civility fell out in Washington this week.
Is this a predecessor sign of a genuine bilateral cooperation towards the front or an illusionary moment before the rapid return to the Partisan struggle in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and Congress leaders did not give rise to the major issues that must be addressed during the "Boiteu Canard" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the Commission on the President’s deficit on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political divergences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological foss, but which, however, still divides members.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both parties are now in a period of testing and mutual testing in order to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed in the last two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenditure, healthcare or rights, both parties remain a miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“It is inevitable after the elections.
The elections raise partisan passions and then they fall.
It's okay."
On certain issues, such as those on the agenda of the "boiteous canard" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or the whole of it, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, only because Republicans cannot make it possible to feel that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, while refusing unemployment compensation for the unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, more planned optimism on a possible agreement on issues raised during the session on the "boither canard", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institution, warned that a successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable.
"When things that must be done, psychologie in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to real cooperation.
“I consider most of what is happening between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the tea voters who have contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce public expenses and repeal the new health care law.
These supportive positions are already clear in the first responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee, including reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, reducing retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes at the committee, consisting of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching this number.
The greatest resistance remains among the electors of the group, suggesting that there are at least few reasons or compromise issues today.
Galston plans two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as Republicans dispute Obama with regard to budgets, taxes and health care; then followed by a period of bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
The public opinion.
It is widely proven that despite the spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans always want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a failure, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the public’s reaction.
Anyone who will be judged to lose will have to change his mind and find compromises.
However, this would be an optimistic point of view.
The party spirit and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a bigger ideological difference between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than then had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of both parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Given this reality, civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort from both sides to find a plot of agreement on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. documents disclosed describe Moscow as a harvest of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "Cleptocracy" and brings to the Kremlin a portion of the wine pots and the protection money it collects, the US embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that contribute to explaining the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while money goes upwards of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expelled.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still Mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but there have been few traces of cleansing since then.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several trials in diffamation of these charges.
In September, he said what followed a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe that their society is corrupted, according to surveys.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy account; and it is unwilling to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people to designate it as "disfunctional" and to claim that the government was acting more as a cleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy.
Criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the city government of Moscow.
Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and militia are at second level."
"In the end, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups make a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB handed the money of the largest companies and that the police targeted the small ones.
A source, he said, "Moscow's business owners understood that it was better to get protection of MVD and FSB ( rather than organized crime groups) because not only they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law.
"That's why the demand for criminal gang protection is no longer so high."
The note indicates that although the collection of money is extended, protection itself can be inequality; even those paying are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their business close under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption but has admitted little progress.
The Embassy's note transmits accounts reporting men carrying bags, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "Indem tank think" in Moscow.
"But it is part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, the cost of corruption, throughout Russia, would be more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154e in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental Transparency International (the countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the U.S. Embassy, which had only been done yesterday, late in the evening, time of Moscow, will surely reverse the discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to demonstrate that it is in turn.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin issued the assumption that WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted angryly to the words US diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and approaching Medvedev from Robin.
“The problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The former Khmer fighters were forced to face the past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with poor quality concrete walls, Anlong Veng secondary school director mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "matter" for its brutality, when he was headed by the Red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated former Red Khmer bastion in the northwest of Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers went to the government, long-term loyalty was finally issued to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly with people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of its former soldiers.
In July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, pronounced his first sentence on a former member of the Red Khmers, convicting the former head of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In the face of this evolution of the situation, anxiety has increased among the former Red Khmer fighters of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There are feelings and fears among the former Red Khmers but they are impotent to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of Cambodia’s Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil.”
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the Pol Pot-Unit government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movements came in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were heading the guerrilla of their base located in the mountains of West Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of red Khmer fighters began to defeat the government, culminating with the 1996 Ieng Sary capitulations and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been headed, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his trial.
Without their favourites, most former red Khmer fighters have gone dark in black poverty, common to the rural regions of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers have kept their positions as local leader in exchange for depositing weapons, they are not qualified farmers in low grade and file.
"These people have received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including at Anlong Veng.
"They are bound by the agricultural utopian ideology of the regime."
"They have been raised in a context where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice cultivator.
“Life under the Red Khmers was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we must meet our own needs.”
The current Court of the Red Khmers has also raised concerns here.
The court should begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The mandate of the court is to judge the high leaders and the chief criminal officers, but he did not say whether he would pursue beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, a 64-year-old, former district leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barrage, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torride evening, Im Chaem returned from the field work located near his wooden house on pilots, on a landway outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court called her, she would refuse to go there.
“Cambodia is in peace and stable,” she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that instability would occur if the court pursued several suspects; although experts and historians contest this.
Cambodia has to break a hole and bury the past, he said.
But confronting the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, the documentation center.
“The reconciliation in terms of Khmer is to reconnect broken pieces,” he said.
“We need to put these pieces together so that we can understand.”
The centre produced the first manual approved by the government on the Red Khmers, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, containing less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng’s young people know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite the city’s links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skeptical when he returned home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he said.
"They disbelieve because they don't know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by the bad herbs and plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black nude, covered with a roof of red sheet.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire battery after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, a road-side cell phone seller, said she didn't know much about the man who was burnt in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many people go there to pray."
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to the last place of rest in Pol Pot where she would leave a bucket of mature bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its military-quality uranium stock
The Belarus government announced Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear matters worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement published after Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have released the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military quality uranium from a Belarus research center.
This opened the way to an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who mentioned the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47-national nuclear security summit, organized on the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit, in 2012.
“I’m really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves that this process works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the "very significant, important step" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear matters around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done this under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Loukachenko said the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have kept high-enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military quality uranium and low-enriched uranium,” he said.
"It's our product... We're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, demonstrating interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated as the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled over 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and removed, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with poorly enriched uranium, inadequate for weapons.
"A close coordination and organization has been implemented to strengthen confidence," leading to Clinton's agreement, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Department of Energy specialized in Global Threat Reduction.
According to the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of highly enriched pounds of uranium.
Belarus seeks to eliminate its stock by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the hard repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But Wednesday’s statement would suggest a potential renewal.
"Everything congratulating on progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential to improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not issued any objection to CIA flights
The government has not objected to the CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda to Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents by Wikileaks in the El País newspaper, which adds that the first vice president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked the Spanish Executive to be informed to “how to demonstrate that they exercised a vigilance over foreign aircraft”.
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing of complicity in human rights practices against dozens of countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report "had surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and emphasized that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "take them off", says Aguirre in a cable.
Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, reported to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive had "to give the case the lowest possible profile, although, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence."
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the disqualification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the CIA Flight Ministry.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has yet to show their concerns about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the information disqualified by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manage the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider warmth to be appropriate", he had given instructions to his employees, "for how they escaped."
The Ambassador also expresses his concern for the action of the PP in this case.
Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the United States.
The parricide that passed to the avenues complained in the network of the "accurately" of being mother
The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used since she was young, she communicated with a cousin and at least a girlfriend; the two origins of Noia, the village of la Coruña from which she is original.
Messages date from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his sentimental life, that ABC built with the help of the testimony of his parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Soon after they got separated, they found out she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
He was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look at the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the contents of his communications, it is heard that their idyle has broken, they have separated themselves.
In March 2008, she is alone in Minorque, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and excited for the fact that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not to have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to go home this month or give me an address to send the child to you."
She complains, "If this doesn't like her, let him leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take it when I go home," she said.
In May, she talks about her return to her village: “This week I’m going to leave, but I’ll only stay there until 19, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a workplace so I won’t lose it.”
She explained that if everything was going well, she would have taken her elderly with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if this person is not my mother,” doubtful intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July there is another post.
When she taped it, the child, who had arrived on the island the 1st of that month, and he was supposed to have been killed the 10th, was dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on one side, but he is not of another."
"Aside from one side he's with me and this place he likes a little, but from another he's going to school almost every day."
She talks about a trip to Majorca.
“There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and so I save some money from the babysitting.”
17, greetings and complaints.
"A very big bishop from Caesar, who asks me when you're going to come."
"Alberto said he sent you, I don't know what videos to email, you see, when he wants it, he finds me, shit."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there's one of them: "He's going to get me money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, watchful, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything had happened so that she didn’t tell him the fact that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma, from the center of judicial prisoners in Minorque.
Officer’s attorney Carlos Maceda said she didn’t remember how the facts had happened, “and she didn’t even plan to hurt the minor.”
Before she had confessed to have nodled Caesar in the bath and placed her body in a suitcase.
The defendant and the prosecutor asked for a psychiatric trial.
People's Party members won 4 seats in Congress and the PSC lost 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already addressed the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes that this training in these committees normally doubles that it receives in Catalan.
Thus, the Catalan people received 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomous, they had 316.222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a PSC vote detour and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this training calculated the fact that if there were general elections, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would win in less than 9 by PSC (and also hold in 10).
These calculations would find that the Catalan place is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose a deputy - he has three now - while ICV would keep a deputy or win one.
But if the election agenda continues, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in their relais to the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulate the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where socialists would not be able to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debut, it would not be fantastic that this training loses its representation in the Barcelona Mayor - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP only recorded a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met again several times.
Popular people also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and seeks to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Except for the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three of them.
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerians held by the Information Commissioner General of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE), and "Lascar and Taiba's Last Author" (Lascar and Taiba's Last Author)
The Ministry of the Interior gave great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that, with the "kampai operation" has "summered" the Al Qaida counterfeiting device at international level and "consequently its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, within the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsely distributed and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only thing that the jihadist network has been operating in Europe, for this reason other European police units, besides Thai services, have participated in investigations, so there may be subsequent hits similar to those recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona on the territory of the European Union.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, another was carried out, with the capture of the Pakistani Tharungs and Ah Ahmadan Ahmadan Ahmadan and Ahmadan Ahmadan Athar.
They were those who led from Bangkok the cell implanted in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - some of which were hit in 2009 - was flying mainly from tourists who fulfild the conditions marked by the World Islamic Front.
That is, the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with validity of several years and no fixed visas.
Investigators stress that so far no details have been found that connects the detained in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, although the author of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiver groups of passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeited in Thailand.
However, it must be remembered that a few days before the attack was committed, a few thousand dollars was sent from Catalonia through a transfer agency that had been "invested" to buy mobile cards that were then used by the "command" components who killed 106 people.
The police took a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had yesterday the opportunity to personally expose to Artur Mas its conditions to support his investment as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which summons to give priority to economicist the recovery of the economy and the lack of national adventures to philo-sovereign
The President of the Catalan Peoples arrived at a meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact that he got 18 members in the election last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, as the CiU candidate requires at least one of the trainings the opposition will abstain in the voting of the investment.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations Mas has today with the rest of political leaders become the key to Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "it would have to eliminate all sovereign and independent speeches" and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque country - which the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
Both leaders share their bets to make the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiation on Mas investment will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Geriatrics claim that the dead were not due to "many measures"
Owners of the Olot Center do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
La Caritat d'Olot (Gérone) managers offered a press conference yesterday to emphasize the damage caused by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly persons whose responsibility was at the time he worked there.
Residential director Joan Sala, accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada, announced that “La Caritat’s desire would be to be able to accuse the responsible” for the dead but “the law and responsibility oblige us to take over the procession situation of civilian officials.”
And in addition to the social discredit that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the night nurse in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since that day he has not stopped killing.
The judge noted in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - which he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of patients, formality took place by phone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and noted that “the lack of measures could at any time have been the cause of what happened.”
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only one indice of impudence from any other than being accused."
The person already baptized as the Angel of the Death confessed 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused him to die by injecting him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the center's staff to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes the nurse, in his desire to relieve internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila is not lying saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, burned them inside by giving them as he already admitted that he did with the three women he killed in the period between 12 and 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the night nurse’s statements, nor the number of admitted murders, they eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justifies their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave during her visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after successfully committing.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
The ECB threats
Investors suddenly reacted to Trichet’s threat yesterday, which warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
The differentials of devices have been closed to force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should also underestimate the ECB's ability to deceive and the euro has barely recorded an incredulity, which is an alarming signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it scratches, it recovers, but motivated by short and very speculative positions closures.
The institutional investor will be late to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB urged us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the completion of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in the future and only leaving unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and retain unlimited quarterly auctions at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that the bond purchase program will continue and even give a signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to remove liquidity measures, God helps us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, the history could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday the one-year traits auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the men in Portugal have lowered 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change in market feeling after Trichet’s words.
The numbers of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published in Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and have a period until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem with the stress test in July, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approbation of its new budget and it has not yet adequate support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, where it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest is the hymn of Beethoven’s joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are the ears of investors such as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange has increased by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a three-year-old auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will solve with a strong demand and help to disseminate doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Assistance Plan would be self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to the markets without day.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "aside from being, it appears."
Courage, we can get out of it!
Eulen’s President will dispute Vega Sicilia’s Council asking his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, as he considers it the "null of law", El Enebro's next court council on 16th, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority validation and take care of the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia holding firm.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest business service holding for companies does not seem to be willing to cede in his dispute to be present in El Enebro’s management bodies.
He was excluded from his board of directors by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the shareholders' assembly of January 18 this year, whose dispute is recorded in the Trade and Company Registry.
The El Enebro Judiciary Board for the next 16, convoked by the Madrid Commercial Magistrat No. 2, again opened the toner box within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the Assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the Assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta, and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate remedy of the applicants of his five sons to try, through a procedural dispute, by clearly fraudulently violating the Law and by abusing law, to validate and correct the assembly radically, according to its officials.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be contested, considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried successfully that the magistrate convoke a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez’s sons control 100% of the capital.
Nevertheless, the founder of the service group asks for 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the appeal for which a date has not yet been reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
A software creates real-time car improvements.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In the first moment, no one took into account the options of a new equation that just arrived, despite the ascending trail of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on Ferrari's triumph by Fernando Alonso.
Without reducing the competence as a champion driver, German Sebastien Vette, not even the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1, we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has handed over to Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very distant objectives of high-car competition.
This powerful PLM computer tool has been used to create mounting chains from manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real manner, avoiding defects and costs that can be avoided.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains the fact that using this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and run "in short hours, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 equations had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team, 180 young, high-qualified professionals are currently working that, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of changes on the balloons.
Siemens’ manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of the Red Bull boils except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
Changes can move from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclave systems.
As a unique limitation of this folly of technological improvement there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit for each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to create and produce its boilers in a 50-kilometre location in London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this duty counts 580 people, including two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is probably the most recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy beverages has put to the service of its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero reputation.
Factory Technology Director Steve Nevey said five years ago we could claim that R & D progress in race cars brought 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of the added value.
Nevey estimates that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install 20 clean stores in two years with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational company plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimark centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP’s Vice President Helena Herrero gave as an example the renovated store located on the Gran Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she worked for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first open ones were those in Bucharest (Rumania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third in Barcelona.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the installation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of the exclusive furniture of stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive manner), which will have a identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trade network claims "improve the service offered to customers and PMEs in purchasing, assistance, post-selling and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-wide pioneer driver program that solves possible problems with HP’s computer equipment as a guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
“So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days.”
"This system is designed specifically for MPES and users, because large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero noted yesterday.
Sabadell bets on ‘flighting’ a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell’s delegated administrator Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Nevertheless, it envisages a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted partially to compensate with the increments of commissions and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture a million individual customers in three years, its task to carry out.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit over the next three years and can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new management plan that will hold a three-year latitude vessel.
The goal, in addition to survival without the need to apply to FROB’s public subsidies, is to gain a market share by capturing a million new individual customers – 700,000 if deducted those who could come out of the bank – its great task to carry out, because so far this bank had more damaged PMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share for individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the betting on productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks are now willing to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all the plans of the world banking sector.
In fact, this year, Sabadell will finalize its management plan Optima, established four years ago, even if the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation determined its extension for another year.
Customers who leave the warehouses to escape will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, thinks that the outbreak of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking affair, he said.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is falling, the price of the risk premiums that banks and cashes pay for their emissions for obtaining liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for margin drops.
“The aspect of liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit.”
“We didn’t close the robinet, but the differences are higher,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías from November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend is now “adding commissions”, but “there is a competitive framework”.
Sabadell’s management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "we will request larger dimensions."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He affirms that capital needs "are greatly increasing" and any Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in funding in the case of new capitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary close of the markets, it has reduced the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He notes that we cannot issue, but on the contrary to what happened in June, we can obtain short-term funding through rest, which relieves the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second wave of fusions among cashes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of fusions of stock stocks and reiterated the speed of restructuring of the sector.
When the concentration process for Spanish sparrows began, there were several entities who assured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Espagnes (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
“I think most of the fusions have been done, it can’t be said that Cajasol’s integration into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments.”
"Most of them have been fully realized; it is possible that instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the tutel of the Spanish Bank, which has also worked a lot in this operation," the head of the country said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta exposed that the concentration process is carried out "at the highest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it is carried out within the time limits set in the past, not now, Spain has, in the plans with the
"The transfer of 45 cashes with an average of 28,500 million assets volume to 17 with 75,500 million is an unmatched process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to conform to Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta admitted that “there are a series of rather unfortunate opinions on the slowness of the process” that demonstrate “a lack of serosity and meaning,” because “what the Bank of Spain does is recalled that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year.”
EEC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world and has assigned to people who doubt it a "many knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic context, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and stockpiles, a system that started a "very important" and "go at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well drawn from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, which vary from tax cuts for PMEs, regulate private investment agencies, or eliminate 426 euros of unemployed aid without professional contribution to the privatization of 49% of ENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat Airports and 30% of the Loteries State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins Chancellor Angela Merkel’s criticism in terms of her responsibility to eliminate the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which is shocked by the one to maintain the ancient traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistances, Germany begins to speculate on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second is the recovery of Mark, although now it seems of science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
Third, a new design of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought to be done (tax strictness plans and public finance stability) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second hit of the Central European country was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
Since then, she has been subjected to a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and public opinion were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliging private borrowers to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has accelerated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process that will make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has traced a red line that she does not think to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be forced to declare to cease payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of costs.
Germany reports that we need to follow a rigorous growth path with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
A debt-based alternative and construction, with huge holes in the payment balance, such as that that presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The placement is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear him.
It is not only to reduce the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what he should not do in these circumstances is to deceive himself.
Hopefully the current turbulences will allow us to reach greater tranquillity.
And let us know the opportunity we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the last Saturday with the large companies and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the theory that order must be put at home.
But the red line that Germany has traced is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities envisaged, it is not possible to exclude the abandonment of a monetary area of too drunk in uncertain countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us about it.
Sports and fraud of law
Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingeniousness but not the willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League made a lot of ink on the anti-sport character of such behavior and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the match (which their team already earned clearly), the two players deliberately lost their time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitrator to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, both players will perform the regulatory penalty during the next match of the bargain match against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Discipline Committee has sanctioned the team coach José Mourinho with two matches and various economic sums for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow carton under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, otherwise rather common in the world of football.
She is so widespread that she takes advantage of the ethos, non-written rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the case related is because this had been the protagonist of a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in his hymn shows nobleness and honour and who in past occasions condemned his players to a fine for similar acts) and to the dramatic provocation of his orchestral history, more apparently, ajoso to a di-il, by Mohorin.
In any case, the debate asks whether such behaviour is not explicitly prohibited by the regulation against the principles of sport, i.e., whether with these actions a law fraud is committed; for they are, in fact, acts that comply with the regulation of sport, but seem to evoke its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting mind.
One of the assets that includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of adverse players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, i.e., there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that we make sense of with the right game is to avoid the team of criminal players in an unfair manner of benefit from the opposite team, which is not the case too.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not fit that it is normally characterized as a trickery or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been done in hiding to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty.
They were waiting and they were willing to accept the penalty.
Another question is the type of benefit that criminals receive from intentional errors.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put in a situation of disadvantage to the rival and we do not get a advantage in the same match, because of course the result of the action supposes to leave their own team with fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next game as the club could not rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action, the players perform a match of sanction and pass to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, grabbing the levels, it is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of the strategic decision making that promotes the maximum profit of what rules allow.
In our case, players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), but otherwise they have chosen the moment they have been subject to it.
They made a strategic decision without punishment or escape.
Although the border between genius and law fraud is spread, I think there has been a clear case of genius.
The problem, I think, appears because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way to transmit the director to provoke them.
The evil caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinner for groups at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar focuses this year on a reservation rate for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the touron and the lottery, when December comes back group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen ball for Barcelona restaurants and entertainment, but because of the crisis, they have caused an offensive that is adjusted to your price to be able to capture the majority customer association: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 to 30 euros on dinner or dinner interviews, men co-incited
In order to complete the accounting complications, this year’s calendar (like the night of Saint Sylvestre falls Friday) concentrated the demands in the week of December 13, which has so far resulted in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the high days (17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies who have eliminated collective dinner for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the conjunction is, they all ask for awards of battle, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not expect to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he said.
The case will be well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he added, and reminds that customers tend to drop a scale with the crisis, so the turnover around 25 euros has become major in demand.
A survey in various centre establishments found the collapse of demands for the night of 17.
The Soteras group says there is an authentic boom of applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than €30, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjoncture, with complete formulas from €25 to 35.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the particularity of the calendar suggested more advanced bookings, even from early November.
“We did everything possible to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locations, remain optimistic after detecting an increase in invoice since the second semester and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that 18 will also be a hyper-active day at the level of friends who celebrate the festivities in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a prediction to spend 10% more than the past year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the champignon method - 'cave'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
The patronage Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), his vice president, Enric Gomá, trusts the possibility to start seeing the end of the tunnel and supports that overall reservations are "animated", even if customers "the most negotiate".
This is true, hope for celebrations has not decreased, unlikely from whom it pays, he says.
The Pakistani Nuclear Program raises major concerns in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at "a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clear and delicious details offered on the content of conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, rather than increasing, "decreases" and that the stable Asian country produces more rapidly than a nuclear weapon in the world.
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report prior to visiting former National Security Advisor James Jones: “The closeness of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials.”
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferation and a reason for maintaining guard.
"Pakistan has hired staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; due to the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs in the United States," said Yuri Korolev, a meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange portal is the increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high degree of nuclear weapons production.
The Embassy in May, which calls “frustrating” communication with Pakistan, supports the following: “Transparency is often inexistent; aid offers remain unresponsive or are eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, observed that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington during an Army chief visit, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make him understand "very clearly" the official that "Pakistan Army must end with silenced support to terrorist groups."
At the Hunting of the Chief of Wikileaks
Obama will call a high responsible for anti-terrorism fighting to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red alert to track the movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and track the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it dates out on November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest filtering of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks’ creator lawyer Mark Stephens assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The 20th international police officer headquartered in Lyon (France) dictated the order on request from Sweden, but he did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of the country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many of the member states, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call red notice a free way for arrest --what the national police body must accomplish - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is, as it is, as it is in the case of Suède.
The movement denied the lawyers of Assange, who published yesterday a letter announcing that the founder of the 39-year-old Wikileaks was willing to answer questions by a video conference by the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange has requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor in his case, comparing with the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
“This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the missile denounced.
While the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he doesn't quiet.
On Monday, he issued an interview to the director of the Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they pledge to the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who qualified the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should be of interest to us," he told CNN.
Obama himself charged a senior anti-terrorism leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange’s contrast with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators announce today.
Peter King, the Congressman who was chaired by the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and pursue anyone who provides contributions or assistance to them".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper’s adviser, had to return to his statements after saying that Assange would be “killing.”
"Obama should turn it into a target and use a crew-free plane or something like that."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever is in the government who has filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and anything that is not an execution would be a very friendly punishment," he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with eye clinches to Carod fans
The Republican leader will give the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the first internal rebellion within ERC, without the north due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware of the fact that his threat to resignation is not enough for the adherents of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches as he had with other off-roads.
That’s why Esquerra’s leader will try to win his new criticism with eye clinches that allow him to blind up until municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisors will be able to pronounce his secret continuity.
By voting newsletters, not by lifting your hand.
If the cardiologists want to drive a certain penalty vote to the president, they will be able to do it without fear of repressions.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered ratified with half more than one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good as well.
People close to Carod demand the president a little more than putting his position at the disposal of the militants, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between Congresses.
But since they do not have enough majority to force dismissals, they will try to approve a road sheet with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the Congress for the autumn of 2011, which leaders consider as a safe fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its aim is to make the organization able to wash its family room once and for all.
In this line, the article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós’ ideologist, the owner of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various goals" is as if it were done.
And he listed five of them, of which he emphasized two.
The first, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militants, i.e., include new figures from the Carod adhesive sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes the liquid ERC once for all as an operating mechanism.
Thus, it defends a reform of the statutes that allows the implementation of Congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this sense in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion commissioned the management to revise the assemblage model in a specific congress of statute reform.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal court of the past few years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors at all, the time could be good to recapture and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the Millennium of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the state of Mexico, four less than the previous month, according to MILENIO in the state of Mexico.
Among the murders are mentioned by three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in the valley of Mexico.
During the last month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in the theory related to organized crime.

The subject had at least three guns of fire and gratitude to the head, except the feet and hands attached to a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a bag inside the port-baggage of a abandoned vehicle in the Mixtecas street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, in Naucalpan municipality.
Early on Thursday morning, the owners of land exploited in common found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the throat, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area crossing Villa Guerrero municipality.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight fire shots when he left his home to initiate the collection of orders.
On November seven, two 30-year-olds were killed by a head-to-head fire impact in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, municipality of Ecatepec.
At Chalco, with a fire strike in front, a man's body was found on a solitaire path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a ball perished with a calibre firearm 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the colony Plaza Golondrina.
Emergency bodies have conducted an extensive search for the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán were warned about the discovery of a body that was in Peña Colorada, with hands attached to the back and with the blinded eyes.
The man had a injury caused by a firearm in his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men who had been enclosed in covers and abandoned in the car box in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality Atizapán in Zaragoza, was discovered with the victims two death warning messages.
One day later, a carton box containing a human head was found in the valley of los Reyes, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by the Incorrigible.
On the 17th, surrounded by covers, two women were found in the Zoquiapan ham in Ixtapaluca municipality and in the morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been surrounded in a yellow and blue cover, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message his executors had left to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms in the neck, the body of a woman's lifeless in the San Francisco Acuautla harbor was found.
On the skin of the woman were detected Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, a man’s body was found on the edge of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three ball impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head of the year and a message were found in the community of Ponte de Piedra, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, saying, “This is what happens to those who do not agree.”
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with arms and legs attached, two bodies were found inside a abandoned taxi behind the San Agustín Colonial Justice Center.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated into the colony Cuchilla Ancón and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a canel belt and a message side; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of this country in the COP16 has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon trace and has detailed that it maintains its offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China continues its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, he said, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he clearly mentioned that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work with the international community in this field.
He noted that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institutional building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been achieved in all of these areas, including the approval of a new Energy Act last year, which recognizes the objectives achieved in terms of greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy savings, energy efficient use and emission reduction objectives.
In addition, it said, there are various multiannual plans ongoing or completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficient Use Program, which has been implemented over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incandescent lamps by saving lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, Scientific Advisor to the Government of the country in terms of climate change, has assured that China's efforts have been larger than we think.
For example, the emission per capita of greenhouse gases in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar to it by 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Spino: César Nava
The national PAN leader detailed that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is law.
PAN national leader César Nava Vázquez assured that Manuel Espino Barrientos’ exile was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is lawful.
In the previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said, in any case, the expulsion of Spino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by making a claim to the Commission of the National Council Order, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he explained that it wasn't time to think about 2012 and there was never an alliance for the presidential nomination on the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the next 4 and 5 December national elections where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the moment, it has been a approach for local elections that has succeeded and reached its goal,” he said.
The panic leader noted that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "the internal competition does not fear us; on the contrary, "we will taste it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council will certainly be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so he would give the relief "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party president's office to any of the five."
He predicted that the party’s recorded re-election in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected on the next dispute, although “it’s not yet time to think of 2012.”
"For the moment it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that "a lot of hopes have been made for them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations."
When asked about the criticism of PRI against President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the prizes to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them begin to defend them; let them get out of the wardrobe," he said.
He said the head of the Federal Executive Officer can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditoire, because there is no balloon in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter the Law on Students Without Papers
“If you agree with the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Twitte said.
President Barack Obama joined national mobilization today to support the Dream Act, to legalize students without papers, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
“If you agree with the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation,” Twitte Obama said.
Its short message maintains an open cyber-link with a wider document that requires the public to contact Senators immediately, as the vote to legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we hope will soon be, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of Bush’s time tax reduction and government funding extended.
Such blockage, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican locking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the fiscal problem is resolved, we will be able to fix an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year.”
"I think we can get an agreement at a given time in this sense and then we can plan the rest sequence," he said.
The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "vote to close the debate" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize paperless students could be voted from Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Refugee Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they were staying in the country in the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the competition of a large number of Republicans, at times when the supporters of the project play an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the law.
Democrats, whose majority supports the Dream Act, have 58 places.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Maine Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux, Florida, who completed his mandate by Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literature you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Plaisirs of the language was a walk in which the participants made the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what are you expecting from me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second step of the Plaisirs of the language, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and this time she used the undertitle of the table, Sex-a-being another question
The finger on the wound"...we put it in embarrassment," the Argentine writer slowly launched to the public, most young people, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to which they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a big story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plaque" is, she goes from a doctor to another, without getting a response, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she gets convinced: “Patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound.”
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumaologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but which explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyst that reveals the mystery: “The wound is what is actually open, the symbolic is the bulb.”
“On the wound I only could know that it is that it is open and that it does not exist,” but I am convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguaan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a pleasant narrative he titled Elogue to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a certain point is discovered.
With the keys of magical realism, he talks about a famely touching the clouds, turning people who had gone away or repaired the virtues a lady had lost, a narrative that turns back to talk about America, the great news that had from the beginning his own chroniclers and quoted Bernal Díaz de los Capices with exc.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) laughed at false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way that we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that even lacked the pot."
Nevertheless, he emphasized, "the crazy and the liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known which part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
This is actually called Cervantes tradition.
“It is because of his inheritance that we are told.”
In turn, writer Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le debt on the wound.
The Cuban-Portoricain has put its attention on the great plague of social violence that its country has - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about trafficking and drug sale.
"I think good literature, good poetry, good songs lock a silenced commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after citing that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that establishes between the author and readers, and that it is a "last chemical reaction."
The evening ends with the intervention of Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "it must be on the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed as well as in intellectual habits and control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatics, “behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes.”
“To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nude: and nude means many times putting the finger on the wound and disturbance people who feel very comfortable by thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas, and without nude, and also inviting the powers that prefer a white world.”
Romano on the hunt of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find each other a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in the finals, he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he could reach the decisive series three times, even though so far he hasn't put into the thousand and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina finally consoled with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The saintist strategy arrived at his first final as coach in the 2002 Openture Tournament, when he held the Morelia renes with which he lost with a total score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the exact score of Ray was 3-1.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bicentenaire 2010 tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a reverse, because his team made a match equal to 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and scored it or three of his players scored the score.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the timonier commented when asked him what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, of which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can hold is that until the arbitrator siffles the final, we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to get rid of us was finished, we can already run it, and I can't believe it.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end in the regular time, but sometimes we just have to prepare it, the final tournament we have been prepared, the previous tournament we have been prepared, the destiny has made us the destiny, and sometimes our destiny is wrong.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste the glory offered by the titles for the first time.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
People must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers before their interview in the Consulate Section; the waiting time will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the visa treatment procedure in the Embassy and consulates of the United States will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves at the Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC, according to their English seals) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will provide certain benefits for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of treating the visa will be lower, there will no longer be any need to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the treatment of the visa, and another for the mail service to register the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visa.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to present themselves at an interview with the Consulate Representative, they will only present themselves to the closest ASC where they will present the documents and will take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who wish a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain there less than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce the discovery of alien life
The U.S. Space Agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living creatures in space.
The National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory of alien life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference on Thursday, at 13:00 a.m. at NASA’s headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, science studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA assured that it would have an impact on the search for alien life,” which has led to speculations from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be inhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too venomous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living, and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that “there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from that we know.”
The space agency will communicate the real scope of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of living on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), in the perspective that his chemistry is similar to Earth’s.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergence and Patron 'block' opponent
With reforms in the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of ‘bipartism’ is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th was just settled when the Congress appeared an opponent block led by the MPs of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of bipartism in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, ‘tone’ against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them,
With this reform, they have repeatedly initiated the ‘bipartism’ because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only to vote against the Directorate Chairman of the PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo noted that these institutionally reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the next days they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme from a political will and if they do not have it, they will be served again by both parties and thus the opponent coalition will end.
“Until this is happening (the opposing coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be permitted, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, is now "duopolistic".
“This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is eternal bipartism in Congress.”
To begin, this group begins with 5 legislators and they now speak to other colleagues to make them more, the Convergent has enriched.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress has now transformed into a 'buthin' between two, making allusion to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked him to respect the deputy's personality, to give him a place to the negotiating tables.
"If they don't leave cupulary agreements outside at 5 which will probably be nine Members, now the five we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to unite ourselves to seek a place in the negotiating table, that's the problem, that in the reform they made, they decided, we're out, and we don't agree with that."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mazatlán Mayor pay another cheque to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles of pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company is 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the City Transparency page, the last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 mile 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "providers account liquidation".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Supreme State Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many checks will be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks have "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the Law predictions when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All of this, after July 25, Norowest had published a review of the checks issued by the Mayor to its suppliers, revealing that in March 2008 - July 2010, in the three-year anniversary of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the paid municipality Camacho Palazuelos, over 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He has also made transactions with Jumapam, paying checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be taken care of
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the foreign tourist accident due to the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round point in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a groove of the round point Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, said they have repeatedly requested the image of the destination to be cared and new activities must replace other than tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trottoirs has affected because tourists come to walk there and see disturbance and avoid nearby trades.
“The politicians know that it means close a business one day and they don’t know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without adequate planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist has exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the Mairie.
"The municipality will have to take its responsibility and avoid this going on again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area, we must entertain it, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there, and the mayor must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it doesn't just depend on the promotion, it must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
“They have not paid their attention to what they need, and this kind of fact emphasizes something that is famous for everyone, maintenance is necessary.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent because they are not properly used and project a bad image.
He talked about a series of places that must be online with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, ordered and be attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers a lot of historical and cultural sites and places that should be ordered first, cleaned and online to make them attractive to add to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, has proposed that Members take great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations facing.
The Mazatlán business sector requests a dignified and free of agreements between the parties and the Government Executive Legislature as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislative session, formed by seven political forces, 19 MPs of PRI, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergencia and one of the PVEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectatives that the new members of the Government Congress are a clean and engaged management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, has proposed that Members take great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa due to the various provocations facing.
"We hope that deputies will truly exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into a carnival mask of governors and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Governor progress.
“We will make sure that they do a decent job and especially engaged with society and sectors because Sinaloa people gave them their vote of confidence in the previous elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives to grow and add forces in search of state economic growth, as the economic situation is now very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they grow economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and this will in a way stimulate the generation of jobs.”
With regard to tourism activity, he asked the new legislators to give him the importance in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I realized that it was the second state secretariat with a lower budget and that it was incongrue as an important economic activity and a generater of currencies and investments and that is directly competing with the agro-industrial industry."
Apart from the need to classify resources to detonating tourist projects that help to ensure the state and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a King of Magic
Cars, cars and bicycles, including toys, are the wishes of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Mages Kings will be difficult to accomplish their illusions, because their home is formed by neither more nor less than 12 people and a cow.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live the day because their father does not have a stable job.
“Sometimes it’s very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the ‘plums’ to sell on the street,” says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four-year-old, wants a bitch or bike, and her three-year-old sister, Isabel, wants a Barbie bitch.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo long waits to have a "monster truck" and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothing in size for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster,' but I told him 'we'll see, my son, because he was very expensive'," Cayetana recalled with sadness.
For older children, who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, warms the size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, warms the size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, warms the size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six sizes would help him much.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have served in drug production.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, money and equipment serving production have been captured,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokeswoman of Québec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, of which the two alleged heads of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested people had to appear at Sherbrooke’s justice palace within hours after their arrest.
They could face allegations of cannabis production, possession in order to make trafficking, complot and theft of services, among others.
These investigations took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is the information received by the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
About 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Québec Security Strait, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Regio participated in this police operation.
Illegitimate migration can continue without any problems
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, should resolve the problem of ships charged with illegal migrants, is obviously being defeated while the three opposition parties reported Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand up with a party that created the granite under your feet," Liberal Chief Michael Ignatieff said, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly Caucasus meeting.
The Liberals claim that the bill as proposed, which would allow any person from a vessel identified as carrying illegal immigrants to hold up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Chef of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he took it to the wrong goal.
"We are against and all opposition parties seem to be against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticisms that his party would not be strong enough for illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take measures against the clandestine passagers and that's what we do through another bill, the C-35," Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring Canadians’ will.
Canadians are massively telling Members that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and treating the country as a cowboy.
"They are waiting for Canada to take strong measures," Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a trusted vote on its bill, which could have led the country to elections following its rejection.
However, a conservative told the QMI agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every deputy who would oppose himself would then explain to his voters.
The new unit does not make the unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, said that this idea was not dated yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this as of January last.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the Tuesday announcement surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services of Quebec, last October 29, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the pequist critic of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement as a "lapin out of a hat" and a "bricholed solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the potential future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it, it's happy to say."
“We are aware of this problem.”
For the President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the launch of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest is obsessed with not wanting to create this investigation commission, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
“The only way to have an investigation committee is Jean Charest’s resignation,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to get out of this failure, he suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate the collapse and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the auditor general," he said.
He also believes that Québec could give the auditor the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government cartons.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague for Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently referring to some amendments related to the case.
During the Operation Spring 2001, which hit the groups of motorists, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several water flows have remained under high supervision due to severe precipitations that have been slaughtered in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A land blowing occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another gliding would take place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road went out.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, severe precipitation occurred on several regions, or from 40 to 70 millimeters of rainfall.
Additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
Since these precipitations need to be added to the already accumulated snowfall in some sectors, there is fear of overflow of several water flows.
Warnings of flood were issued Wednesday night by the Quebec Civil Security for the Ouareau Rivers and the Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentides, and the Chêne, in Lotbinière, were subject to flood wares and remained under surveillance.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong precipitation led to the overlap of certain lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and in Rawdon.
At Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was captured due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the overthrow of some lakes led to the closing of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains on a warning foot and closely monitors the situation, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec crude forecasting center issued on Wednesday alerts of strong crude for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and the Wolf.
Dupont partially blamed
Québec’s radio animator Stéphane Dupont has been partially reversed in front of the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial talks on social assistance and Haiti as well as on his gross wave language.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team were entitled to express their opinions, but that some words contained "inaccuracy of social assistance information, negative Haiti representations and gross language that is not suitable for broadcasts during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two suicide persons, did not violate the codes on broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assistants of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Animators must provide solid information rather than misleading.
When it comes to suicide, the animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a loose gesture.
The majority of the Committee members concluded that the confirmed message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life problems.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes in question of "Dupont south" have addressed a delicate subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No offense has been held in his place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then came to a face-to-face media that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI animator said he had made no donations to help the Haiti because we couldn’t know with certainty that the needy people would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an indiscriminately negative representation of Haiti.
"I've already cleaned my three-day suspension on it."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the animator said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the spread of gross language.
In each case, the radio broadcaster CHOI-FM has collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station that will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during the great listening hours within three days.
A King of kung-fu in Montreal
Montréal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special route.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing rises on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
“In my case, I’m looking for fights a bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like the soil game present in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, the one working as a security agent and commissioner for UPS has just issued bad news to its rivals, won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
“The fighters that ended up among the first four during the last world championship in each category were invited.”
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
“In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament in fifth place, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009,” he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve progressed in every competition.”
At this pace, I will be the first this time or next year!
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where swelling and foot strikes, as well as soil projections, are allowed.
Duels originally occur on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist derived from this form of battle is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to resign only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence in the super tournament "King of Sanda", the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most prominent and most prestigious in China," the sympathetic gaillard explained.
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stade (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he analyzed.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals are confronted in the final of their category."
“The winners of each category are faced in order to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu.”
450 million contracts without tender calls
Hydro-Québec freely granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avenue of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor which has gained the most important, the project management, for a sum of $295 million without tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was established in 2004 simultaneously with the choice of Hydro-Québec to trust the private sector to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
In early 2005, the Energy Management Consortium decreased the profitable contract without a public tender call.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and cause price rise.
“This is the new way to make collapse and defeat competition.”
“This is that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly,” said Pequist Deputy Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said it was hard to see how the public interest could be used in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, deniing that there was a collapse for this contract.
"I began to have my journey," she said, claiming that the PQ had been "unfair" and "many strictness."
She said that "it would be the least of things" that the PQ apologizes.
The formula of consortiums is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to assemble their respective expertise in order to respond to a tender call for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity taking into account the scope of the work.
The workshop is in progress and must be extended until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the play of competition; there were negotiations.
Consortium formula is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of the consortium in the engineering advisory sector is being investigated by the government.
A fast overflow of Quebec’s business register allows to count more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one same moral person, that is, Dessau.
As regards the Consortium Energy Management, the Normandy Minister stressed that "the Bay James territory responds to particular workforce dynamics and that Hydro-Québec responds in particular since the 1970s".
The project’s chief Eastmain, Real Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has made a burden on the fact that the project management contract has been granted freely.
"If you are calling for tenders and there are few tenders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market and say: we're going to negotiate a satisfying agreement and a good price."
"But the idea is that this is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of over $10,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir accounted for 109 engineering advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin completed 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting his participation in Energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344 including the Energy Management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies consisting of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "beautifully known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
The Minister of Normandy has left that the PQ is also linked to those firms that “finance him”, before he has stated that it was rather his leaders.
Responsible Consumer Barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but honestly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in fair brands and environmentally friendly certifications to guide their choices.
Pis, even if it baths in a media universe where the messages for more responsible consumption pull, it regrets a lack of credible information, a lack that it even qualify as a brake to its commitment, says the responsible consumption Barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecians seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the responsible Consumer Observatory at Sherbrooke University.
Another note: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications based on the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands that appear to be environmentally responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Québecians.
However, responsible consumption information seems essential to stimulate this lively consumption by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, the vacuum and suspicious nature of information would calm down the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of the Québecians also say they are incredible to the alleged performance of green products or services that they are trying to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habits and, above all, changed the brand of one or more products to respond to their beliefs.
At up to 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and preferred the purchase of food cultivated in their region, the Barometer said.
More green and responsible – the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year – the Québec Homo consumus loves to appear as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprints by worrying about animal protection.
However, its social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside of its car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of the Quebecians indicated that they used public transport or recommended co-vehicle to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which just took its first cliché.
State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Québec, who has been asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus Company and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but with only one loan.
The Angus and the Parallel Development Society, who hoped a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinematographic complex on the Saint-Laurent boulevard by giving him his full cinematographic vocation, does not get what they claim.
The government agrees to engage in the case, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Québec proposes a loan which would be less than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of sources from state offices.
A first plan of action and a demand of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have been resumed since.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to Minister St. Peter by the President of the Society for Cultural Enterprises Development (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris file.
He made a recent report a dozen days ago.
But the counter-proposition of the cabinet reached the SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have to respond until 31 December.
However, it appears that the assumption of the State donation must be really deprived.
Remind that the Québec Film and Cinema Owners Association was opposed to a state direct investment to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture did not have to finance real estate projects, which did not do for other cinema rooms.
But, on the contrary, several intervenants in the environment demanded substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the Master of Ceans, has put the author’s cinema in his complex premises for ten years after financing his own construction, which could justify an exemption from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shouting at Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his client.
The Angus Company and the Parallel Company, with their head Christian Yaccarini, on their own, pilot a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to drive the acquisition wheel.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, the Parallel, has continued to broadcast eXcentris films.
The goal of future buyers is to open the three rooms on February 27 by projecting the very beautiful movie of Xavier Beauvois Man and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled the duty and we don’t know what he and his group think about the lower proposals made to them.
The sea lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the U.S. considers the Canadians’ infirmity complex to the Americans, but at the same time they betray the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter did not have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, found on the public site yesterday, offer more crustful details than the substantial content to be put under the teeth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, or in full federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
The great surprise of the U.S. ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation.
“A complex of nearly inherent Canadian infirmity requires Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the daily day rather than to make this election about the United States (such as during the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he wrote.
The United States is, therefore, “the elephant proverbial of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it.”
The Ambassador understands less than this "soulsy silence" than both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logicly, he estimates, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, business directed at Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure government survival during a trusted vote on the federal budget in early February, by which Canada will show its first deficit in more than a decade due to a $30 to $40 billion recovery plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is mentioned that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast to CBC are returning from the United States.
The Ambassador is worried about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O emissions, in which we observe little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the removal of the CIA's muscled interrogation.
Another cable reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French co-author Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the case-by-case case.
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the case."
Finally, the spirits are warming up with WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC's waves that the responsible for this massive escape should be "killing".
Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancún a renewal plan for domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (GES), which corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional reduction to be achieved to stabilize the planet climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan lies in the series of major concrete projects the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the proposed plan yesterday, if incandescent ampoules that still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED"), the main humans would be 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES issued to the planet.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planet car park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, major broadcasters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans that would make total emissions of GES from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to suppress this balance of 5 Gt to stabilize the climate’s rise to 2 centigrades by 2020 in order to prevent it from being out of control.
In incandescent pumps, 95% of energy dissolves in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
With fluocompact pumps, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new DEL pumps, this energy need is reduced twice.
The fluocompact ampoules last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL pumps, such as those launched by Philips manufacturing company this week - this company has also participated in the U.N. study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent pump, giving an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with rheostates in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several specialists have displayed reserves on the spot of fluocompact bulbs as they contain mercury and need to be eliminated as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoules, but rather the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce waste of electricity in incandescent ampoules.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the profits each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects in nervousness to announce election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent electoral committee to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman of the UN chief said.
"He urges all Ivory parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the announcement of temporary results."
Despite the pressures carried out by some foreign governments, the electoral commission left the date on Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
Around forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the EI said to the television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied on Wednesday in the world so that the CEI will finally declare the name of the second round winner between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "frauduleous" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the missing State coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the Ivory President's campaign director, said that the campaigns of intimidating voters by the UN in the north of the country had dissuaded the president's supporters to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are restrained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political allie from Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a North man who denied anything related to the former rebels, deemed "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to claim the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee from spreading the results, would be illegal.
The second tour of the presidential election, Sunday, was supposed to curb the process of reconciliation and reconciliation of a remaining country split in two years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the Ivory political class that it could be responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended in the first round on October 31, with 38% of votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Bureau (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% counting overseas departments), according to fixed seasonal variations (CVS) data published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed at 9.3% of the methopole active population and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate appears to rise by 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were available within two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people present on the labour market continued to deteriorate, with a new increase in unemployment rate, with 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% involving DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the sense of BIT.
The seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points in three months as well as in a year), 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% in France.
Insee has no longer published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini examinated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53-year-old, head of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS chairman of the Board of General Bouches-du-Rhône, was reviewed and scrolled at the arrest house in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been examined for abuse of social assets, dismantling of funds and public assets, receipt, active corruption, influence trafficking and ammunition detention, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and is trying to explain all the questions the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
“It’s easy to pursue him for a multitude of rebellious leaders, it’s something else to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told the AFP before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini held, through his lawyers, to pass to the judge before his hearing a memory to explain.
One of his closest friends, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examining Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything else but to do the discharges he had to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew about it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General for the Services of the Agglomeration of Aubagne, was reviewed on Wednesday for the deviation of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client knew to provide explanations to the facts that were reproached to him."
"The magistrate instructor took it into account when he was not free," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been examining and released on Tuesday to Wednesday night, with a placement under judicial control for two of them, Deputy Attorney of the Republic Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for Purity of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is pursued for "influence traffic and passive corruption".
Two officials of the Agglomeration of Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are examined one for "substrating and deterring public assets by a person responsible for a public service mission", the other for "complete deterring public funds".
Alexandre Guérini’s companion, Jeannie Peretti, has been examined for “the abuse of social assets”.
Among the people faced with Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently enrolled in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement concerning Corsica.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to whiten the money of great banditism.
The investigation was conducted as part of several judicial information open against X in April 2009 following anonymous mails for alleged frauds in public procurement, particularly in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the assignment and operation of a discharge of La Ciotat, which collects the waste of Aubagne as well as certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elysee exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in Halene in France, put diplomacy in alert, and emphasized the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attention of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le World reveal some under this crisis.
They describe how Elysee explained its strategy to the Americans, going to give them advice to deal with their own "season" crises in Iran (a small group of hiking).
They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not had to counterpart the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France, and sought by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put under crude light the way the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage employment cases".
The Elysées Strategic Affairs Advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interviews U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forces in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "martle constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to embrace the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, past the attempts of discussions through discrete channels, “silentness will not fix anything,” the Iranians are “masters of dilatator manoeuvres”.
Richier added that the detention of foreigners is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the capture of refugees for political chanting".
He announces that Clotilde Reiss prison release (which will take place on August 16, on the day she refugiates to the Embassy of France) will "require the payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of guarantee).
And he tells us that the Elysee anticipates other occupation crises, a phenomenon that “will get worse.”
Iranians could "in a near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. claims the extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released to Paris at a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, asks about this troubled incident.
For Washington, who tracks Iran’s secret networks of acquisition of nuclear equipment, Majid Khakavand’s expansion is a bad news.
Did France accept a merchandise?
The Liberation of Iran against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
“Elysee,” he said, not only has been “summer completely taken by the judge’s decision,” but has sought to oppose it.
“There were live exchanges between the French Presidency and the Sheal Guard” (at the time Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot return to the decision,” he said.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "tight" surveillance of French information services.
The Elysee adviser composes a telephone number and then informs U.S. diplomat that Iran is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elysee does not minimize its efforts, by means of communications and "futes" organized in the media, to make it believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influence" role as a "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles impact the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the "Mediatic Blitz" of French officials.
On what is the basis of so much "thankfulness" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
Despite their statements full of praise, French officials recognize privately that they have only a wave notion of what the Syrians actually have done.
The document then reflects on the reasons that pushed Elize to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which “was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and immortal.”
By exaggerating the Syrian role, Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “seed seeds of discouragement between Syria and Iran”.
The U.S. Embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier told him: “Of course, we don’t know whether the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them yet."
“This should at least be sowing confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysee.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called Cendrillon law that will prohibit teens from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to request online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight, younger ones under 16 years of age, representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family said.
“A lot of children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the Minister for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also considers asking companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also make available to people who require it free software that allows to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the world champion of online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games in front of 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designates organizing countries
In full disturbance due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints on Thursday the 2018 and 2022 World Cup organizers countries, a critical political choice where influence and lobbying struggles may take a step on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the queen competition of the FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its settlement in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar’s emir, Belgian and Dutch government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of a world’s economic and political challenges.
Treatment in coulisses can therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) records have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, originally the revelations resulting in the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football basket that only received the World Cup once in 1966.
The BBC gave it a layer on Monday, broadcasting a documentary that embalmed three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to disagree with the FIFA and put the English officials in embarrassment, who have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The head of the government hopes to reedit the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained the JO-2012 organization in 2005 for London.
Will this intense activity be enough to threaten England's blast with the EC?
Nothing is less safe because the duo of Spain-Portugal is missing atouts with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could showcase their ambitions.
Potential reprisals against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia’s quota, becoming an outweigher despite the deficiencies of its dossier (states, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfaithful competition in the preparation of the vote", in a allegation barely blamed against the accusations of the British press against the EC members.
"We cover them with bowls, we try to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appears as the logical favorites.
First world economic power, headquarters of the leading sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to have a long forward on Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new candidates appear prematurely for two countries who co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the World Cup 2026 to China, which is strongly desired by the FIFA, which would actually make Asian chances fall by 2022.
With Qatar, which made the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries have more risks than certainty.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights acquired by European countries, the nerve of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle was really ashamed.
Mitterrand had made him believe he was ashamed.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they.
One mandate to Elijah calls another.
So the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But obviously, it does not do good household with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to do it as if doubts were still there.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without believing, Jacques Chirac’s friends claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, with severe air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "some part in autumn 2011".
As he talks to UMP parliamentarians in the Elysee on Tuesday evening, the prospect of "two mandates" has sown a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
We were far from it.
The President only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision was limited to the number of five years.
He made a note, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he speaks of the presidential, on the tone of humor, during such meetings.
“The worst, or best, you still have it for seven and a half years with me,” he had launched them in July 2009.
Rebelled in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the next step."
His speech about yesterday does not make him more candidate than the last night; they do not make him less.
If they make comments, that’s for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race to candidate for the PS, on the one hand.
But this isn't the high school entrance of Segolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
This is because his 2012 nomination is obvious that many of the PS demand an early order of battle than expected.
Bad surveys, on the other hand.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer François Fillon's candidate to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," he immediately and carefully reacted to the Prime Minister's surroundings.
“If he believes the defeat possible, he will not be a candidate,” says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always believe he'll be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, apparently awarded.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state securities
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to specify how the crisis starts, or at least to announce the cessation of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that must be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt forces the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will certainly not be able to be as prominent under the penalty to aggravate a situation more severe than today in the European bond markets.
The political cost would be higher.
Tomorrow, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in the resolution of the State debt crisis in Europe.
She did not want to say if she thought that the central bank should do more, e.g. increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
“I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...).”
In Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show much more discouragement about his intentions, requiring to indicate that the state securities purchasing programme on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" during the meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate unchanged to 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of the Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, at nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, the expectations of purchasing purchases are without doubt (see page 29).
Economists also do not expect a significant change in the head.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter continues to carry out unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Today economists are waiting for this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine she's changing her program significantly."
“If not, it would take the risk of causing new short-term tensions,” said Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations to encouraging an outstanding market,” Norbert Bräms added.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the emitting institution has no other choices than to maintain its presence on the market.
"He needs to be replaced at any cost by the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent the packing of the earnings paid by the most fragile states," a major obligatory manager said yesterday.
Because if interest rates are flying, the States will be more disturbed to reduce their endlessness, otherwise stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government rounds its back
After a week-old start for Italy, the situation was slightly relaxed, yesterday, with the reflow of obligatory rates at 10 years.
A return to the calm precary.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the region said that Giulio Tremonti had heard the status of "unchangeable" and expected a "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party later denied.
In any case, the German long-rate gap had reached the record of 210 base points and the price of CDS’s coverage contracts against bankruptcy (CDS) had flew to 263 points, resulting in a certain drop in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the gap with German rates was more than 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, declared himself "previously concerned" about the "market turbulence" and possible contamination from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the athony of tax revenues that goes with, causing the State to run the risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts have been a cold shower for the government.
Italy’s growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget under review at the Senate table is at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (vs 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
That is why the rumors of a new budgetary collective that could be set up after the holidays, for a amount of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will be taken," economic Commissioner Olli Rehn said.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
“The fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have repeated it for a long time,” says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund for the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are less than those requested by other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The issue of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion to the House of Deputies, following which anticipated elections could be held at the end of March.
In the event of a serious crisis, there would be an unfavorable period of time.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde again marched it as part of a press conference in Paris: "I think Europeans have demonstrated it on Sunday and at night, of course, solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although any relative, the recreation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State bonds brought water to the mould of governments and the ECB.
But we can’t talk about a start of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor’s rating agency announced that it could degrade Portugal’s debt note, the most targeted today by speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which is particularly important to banking systems,” said Exane BNP Paribas economists.
More than “political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it calls for, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis systems.
The informal consultations between the most directly concerned finance ministers and, more widely, with their G20 pairs are going well.
And this also for the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the fate of non-conventional support measures for the euro area countries in the market collider (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform extreme-eastern investors of the crisis developments in Europe.
If the goal of these visits is not to raise funds, it will certainly prepare the field.
The first ESF securities is scheduled next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
Portugal and Spain are preparing for structural reforms, in particular in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the closer-effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from that of Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, each and the other must avoid seeking international assistance before establishing their own budget corrections and deciding on structural reforms necessary to restore sustainability.
Finally, European funding donors are focusing on the options available to accelerate the standardization process of sovereign bond markets.
From the passage to Paris, on November 24, Axel Weber first advanced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to resign to the portfolio.
Barclays Capital’s economists, an actor of any European sovereign debt market plan, consider that a delay of around €100 billion would "preferably" be sufficient in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism that has so far been equipped with EUR 60 billion.
A council that has all the chances of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions would deteriorate.
Snow and glass: 24 orange supervisory departments
Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and may distort certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and glasses.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, supported snowfalls affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and it weakly snows on the island of France.
Snow layers from 2 to 5 cm, point 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disturb certain economic activities, Meteo France warns.
In the coasts of Armor, several departments were prohibited with heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion axles and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic in the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged Wednesday evening to limit the circulation of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to be most careful on roads and adapt their driving accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines on Thursday to cancel 25% of their flights to the Paris Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: First Financial Skills
Since the debate about the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been overwhelming, billions are rain.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris subway that the Grand Paris Society must build.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a $4 billion capital dotation.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to borrow a share of the financing of its double cycle on the markets.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectification Finance Act, reviewed in the Committee on Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: “The product of this tax is €117 million per year.”
The second is a reorganization of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and affect this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How much would it report?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
“It is clear that these tax resources are added to €4 billion of capital dotations that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society as the project is, as well as as the project,” the statement said.
In the SGP, we don't find this shocking system.
“From the moment we created revenue (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then tapped in the four billion later, it is explained.”
"It will be recorded in the budget and shot at the same time and at the same time."
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be enrolled in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised four billion are still absent subscribers, can cause a slightly agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on December 7.
Avengers Hackers and Spy in Diligence
WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, she announces profound changes at international level, and prefigure a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press cuts.
U.S. "extraordinary" revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what has been read in any newspaper for months (except those of whom Berlusconi is owner), and Khadafi's sinistre caricatural profile has long been for sketch-made cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records must be composed only of known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unexpected research (and knows where to look for news about the inexistent), but because those who are devoted to occultism believe only what they already know, and reaffirm what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
I'm going to get the secret files.
The informator is parseous, and parseous (or limited in mind) the head of secret services (unless it could be, I know, editor of Liberation), who keep as true as he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that Newsweek published last week.
So why did the revelations on these records make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say that every cultivated person already knows, namely, that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of state can call or take a plane to meet dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have become spying centers.
Any investigative film spectator knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one seems to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put U.S. diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secrets of the world’s most powerful country brings an unnecessary touch to the prestige of the State Department.
As a result, the scandal does not put victims as much in crisis as the "burrows".
But let’s come to the deep nature of what has happened.
Then, in the time of Orwell, we could conceive all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy has been fully proven since, able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction carried out, the hotel visited, the loaned highway, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is demonstrated, as it is now happening, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a citizen's revenge - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep his own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that everything to know about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret because it is covered by the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets.
WikiLeaks made no mistake to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury caused to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer be able to online any reserved information - this would be about publishing it on a linked post at the corner of the street.
But it is as obvious as with current technologies, it is unexpected to hope to maintain confidential reports by phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore Romanian, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to the uncontrollable routes, bearing only messages learned by heart or, at least, hiding in such rare information.
The information will be stored in a single copy in key-closed shooters: at the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now in cravings, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a telegraph on wires (telephones).
Videos (analogical) allowed cinema researchers to explore a step-by-step film, moving forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on the plane, and the trips included, it takes three hours and a half.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication techniques return to horse cars.
One last observation.
Previously, the press tried to understand what was happening in the secret of the embassy.
Now, they are the embassy who ask for confidential information to the press.
Climate: How France Bids its Finance Promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the compliance with the promises of rapidly unlocked funding (the ‘speed start or early funding’) made by developed countries.
And the big French biduillages are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to delivering $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France has promised 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU launched the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, big side event, brochures distribution...
Transparency is valuable and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like to do the same with all developed countries at the same level of precision.
The EU announced it had released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right path for respecting its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, be "new and additional", in order to ensure that additional effort is made without being at the expense of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million per three years for fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or to the overall level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional funding"...
Another crucial element is the distribution of donations and loans.
There, there is no rule, and everybody chooses their method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that a loan is equal to a given one.
Of course, this is hardly justifiable: effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is impossible to present a euro that will be recovered as an equivalent of an interest rate that is given to the euro...
But France only has such a reason: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to verify on its own.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other words) comply with their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the very large majority of the European Union puts €1 to satisfy its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that effort is comparable.
Nice passport tour!
In summary, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scroll: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other hand on the reality of financial efforts.
By spending only 36.1 million euros, it can make it believe that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in cohesion with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy that conducted the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to borrow?) and in negotiations as developing countries are not completely deprived of...
The early financing chapter is only a small question, relatively short-term, compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be a more sand grain in the huge machine that is UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to take the lessons from the first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with other EU countries.
However, above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (a second crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of loan accounting.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
Hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and use of loans would naturally increase the level of international trust needed to advance in discussions.
Alerts for pesticides injected by children
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Futures Generations Association (Ex-Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the processed problem", purchased foods usually consumed in four meals and an encase in a day by a child a dozen years old in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as friandises, were examined by laboratory searching chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the seat is enabling: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as potential or likely cancerous and five classified as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disturbances (PE), according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
“Even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individually taken chemical are not exceeded, we see both in our survey that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially cancerous and/or PE contaminants is concerned,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea only contain more than a dozen possible cancer residues and three proven as certain cancers as well as nearly twenty residues that may disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as an encase by the study, has traces of six chemicals, of which, however, a fungicide is prohibited in France.
The same thing for Kenya’s green chickens, included in lunch, on which the study detected traces of a strong forbidden insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hacked steak, the tone in the box, and even the bread baguette and chewing gum were fraudulent with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water of the robinet, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastic seat used to heat the meal to the microwave was not free.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminants cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on its own, proposed "the emergency face of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase of civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
