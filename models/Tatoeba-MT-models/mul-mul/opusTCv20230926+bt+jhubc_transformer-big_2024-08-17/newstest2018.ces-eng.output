Civil Rights Movement issued a Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful People (NAACP) has published warnings for colorful people traveling to Missouri based on state discrimination and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation for Missouri State, with effect from 28 August 2017, urges African-American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to gain increased attention when travelling across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that currently occur throughout the state," the report said.
NAACP noted that this step has been taken on the basis of the current laws of the Missouri State, which facilitate the defense of racist-motived acts before the court, as well as as as a result of the acts of criminal proceedings that are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“There is a violation of civil rights.
People are arrested by police only because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," the president of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have the greatest number of complaints.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the United States.
Among the incidents that the organization cited were racially motivated surrender directed towards black skin students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanderse, a black skin man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year, after he got gasoline and police threw him into jail without being accused of committing a crime.
The Travel Recommendation also notes a recent statement by the Higher State Representation of Missouri state, which states that black drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues from what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People must be ready - they should drive money with them for any charges or warn their relatives that they are going to travel a country."
According to current FBI reports, in 2015, hundreds of cases of hatred occurred in Missouri, reaching the state sixteenth place among all states.
At the same time, travel warning is a response to the new Missouri law, which facilitates the company’s claims for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after the state adopted immigration law, allowing state agents to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which according to the ACLU to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendation is usually issued by the Foreign Ministry, but lawyers have recently rejected these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family isn’t calm.
She was murdered by Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by boss Mark Dixie directly at the restaurant she worked on, who planted her painful wounds.
The victim and the killer had to have sex together and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The murderer was then sitting in a nearby cafe and watching close criminal work in search of the crime place.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years of freedom in 2008 for the murder and rape of the Sally model.
The court admitted only the attack of a young man, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead in the street.
Three years later, the police convinced him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-friend Lewis Sprotson were fighting in the nights of fate.
The killer said, "He was seriously angry, and after his attack, the girl began to shout."
"He even attracted the attention of the taxi drivers," he lied.
According to his statement, the girl had to defend herself, if she could, however, missing.
Lewis had to put her on the street.
Dixi's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After confession of Dixie, she talked about her intimacy and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn a marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, he told the police himself, Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
"Sally started shouting for help, so she attacked her back and put her hand over her mouth," the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by the vandals destroying her grave.
He was injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people in freedom who are buriing these tombs.
"Our daughter isn't there anymore," the Mirror told the mother of Linda's deceased girl about the disappearance of the urna with the pop.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are not prudence or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who operates the Prague Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anny Mareš.
It began unclearly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž went on a bike trip with his friends after Morav.
One of them took not only a bike, but also the boxes were full of unnecessary vibrators.
"They've got a lot of dolphins and dolphins and it's all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend decided to collaborate with another partner with a German designer of Fun Factory, which Martina enjoyed, and thus offered to help with marketing.
When a companion left to devote himself to another profession, he replaced him.
Today, it operates in the boutique Intimity in Prague, where it sells erotic aid in the way that luxury hats or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you're having fun about this at lunch, are you?
But let's not be such a Puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the boutique Intimity.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than they are all used to here.
No covers, all made in beautiful, decent style, products exposed rather than in perfume.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka began to think about how to understand the Prague business where he should be and how he should be named.
The name of Intimity was preferred by both.
"It's still related to intimity and it's also, it can be said, gentle," he says.
She followed the purchase of an internet domain and searching for a suitable space that went parallel to various visualisations of the interior.
Finally, she won the variant, which distributed the shop into the garden of the luxury and the bedroom, whose duches of the bed.
We were prepared by Dagmar Stefana from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
First, he didn’t seem perfect to us because he wasn’t on the main street, but again he sat on the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It’s in the street next to the main, so no one is repeating the customers,” Martin Ráž praises.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a shop that would be different, with brand-beautiful goods, in an environment where women, mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a trade at all.
When I entered the Intimity store half an hour ago, the streets wanted to be empty.
I didn’t even feel like I was going to shop with erotic aids.
At the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior I know from the fashion boutiques.
Although there is only a woman’s service in the store, it doesn’t mean that women don’t want to ask for help.
Most of the ladies come here to buy gifts for their girlfriend.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and choose rather bigger," Martin smiles on a frequent mistake.
These are such prejudice, those experienced climbing that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose an unnecessary great vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black clothes, but a woman usually tires rather to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don’t know who is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
Pere, in my teenage need to be amazed by what a serious tone I have to interpret.
As if it weren't worried.
And that doesn't actually get rid of it.
It is a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he would be so well accepted.
This is the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the form of a sea horse.
He made sure that women began to be more interested in designing such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He totally confused a taboo that can survive in some men, that he can see competition in erotic aids.
"There are different variants," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is my favorite category.
With a loving connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the categories of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they need to use it only externally.
In Western Europe, especially in younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It’s hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it should be a bit different.
The question is what to offer to men," Martin said.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." Mostly, the masturbator is sold, in this case, by the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical image of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experiences of use.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It causes a surprise in me.
I thought the Japanese had a lot to suffer for erotic aid.
"That's the internet reality," I explained.
The one is completely different.
Here in Europe are more erotic helps associated with using them by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for interesting - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, is still about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not astounding.
Instead, we are a totally reverent nation.
Unlike countries such as Poland or Italy.
The typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and has a certain experience with sexual life, even with some help.
It will come for something more beautiful, quality, which will complement a partner life, or itself." To get back, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka make sure that every product is perfectly functional.
We don’t want to go to specialties of the kind of bondage and latex, because we don’t have any space for it, but it’s also going to happen here.
Such things could reflect those that we are trying to target.
What are people who have always had a good idea to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look out on them.
A lot of products on the pockets are really nice.
This is also due to the selection of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first award was the above-mentioned sea horse "and it launched a change in the whole sector.
It began to get rid of cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-free, it began to produce different designs, different colors...
Beautiful is that the design of some is behind the Czech Republic, although popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I was quite surprised how many people are buying those design items Whoop.de.doo from Anne Maresh, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus's balls from Anna Mareš.
She made a really huge piece of work by reflecting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic help can be done differently, beautifully, with the story.
Annin's story started as a school work.
Now it is a finished product that is also manufactured with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Because it’s not a big deal, but a small series, it’s certainly more expensive than a big series.
I may go a little bit against the current, but it seems important to keep the development in our Czech Republic.
It might be quiet that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," she later describes the situation that Anna and Martin agree that our company is increasingly open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
They say that people are most disappointed.
"But then you will begin to smile." Currently, Anna Mareš has a vibrator in the offer, which you can keep making a personal message, and this year she also plans her own lubrication gel.
In the next year, there will be vibrational eggs and other news.
Borders of Healthy Sex
I'm wondering where the limits of what's right.
Is there anything that Martin Ráz wouldn't have paid for?
It is very difficult to define.
Whatever comes normal, the other may seem totally abnormal, so rather we define the range of brand manufacturers.
None of them enters into some extremities.
Before we get rid of ourselves, I have the last question: what was the crazyest demand you got?
Just a week there was an email in which a lady asked for masturbation aid for her friend with a long 20 inches of nature.
So we had to write that, unfortunately, we have nothing like that.
The question is still whether anyone of us has made a joke,” Martin says in a suspicious look.
And that happens from time to time...
Wounds for Karl Gotta.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Stedry is fighting with a serious illness.
The best friend of Karl Gotth fights the disease that will steal all memories to people.
"Yes, that's the truth," the singer himself confirmed the sad information of Bleska.
I know about my illness, and I can handle it in terms of circumstances.
"Bear drugs that have leading phenomena to slow down the disease," he added, thanking the closer for support.
The whole flourish family came to make Karl's life easier.
Eve’s wife is trying to stay at home as much as possible, after her father’s home on the White Mountain, her daughter from her first marriage to Zuzan and Teresa, the son of Karl said to her.
He fought twice with cancer and gave Slavic his experience to support him during his challenging treatment.
He has sixty chemotherapy.
He was able to return to work after them on the tennis court and on the ski resorts.
"I've been predicted from astrology that I'll be here in the ninety years," Karel Blesku said.
He's a fighter.
They still want to sing.
"I always repeat the words of the song so I can't forget them," he admitted.
The same disease is now fighting in the constitution as well as the actress Flora Fial.
Do you have a family of Alzheimer's?
Look at how to behave with him.
The Chilean parliament cancels the interruption ban, the law assesses the U.S.
In Chile, there is an absolute ban on artificial interruption of pregnancy, so it should not be carried out for health reasons.
"I hate that the legislators have filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that there will be now ten people to decide what we have negotiated in parliament for more than two years," Socialist Senator Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August it is supposed to have a new president, which is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The absolute interruption prohibition, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19.
The legal opposition then announced that the law was attacked in court because it violates the right of an unborn child to live.
Voting on the bill last month has been delayed until it is analyzed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the parliamentarians approved the proposal and then again the Senate made it.
According to the new legislative amendment, a criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy should be stopped in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fetus does not have hope of survival, or if pregnancy is caused by rape.
The Spanish newspaper El País, Chile, has since existed since 1931, which means that before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute interruption ban in 1989 was introduced by the right dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before leaving the president’s office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where an absolute interruption ban applies.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind the networks who have been sentenced to 30 years of imprisonment for the interruption of pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, there was a spontaneous abortion that the court referred to as a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump’s White House is now Socha Freedom
A misleading sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the soch.
The Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see the careful defeat of Saddam Husayn's socket on the Baghdad Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s key supporters, certainly knew what he was doing when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosto on the subject of presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he expressed symbolic secrecy on the Socho of Liberty.
It's important to add that Miller didn't attack the sofa as such.
For this, he would be lynched by a donation of travel ship owners and imitators of Sochy Freedom.
However, he attacked her significance, particularly the fact that in 1903 a plaque was placed on the ground with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
“I don’t want to go to history here, but Socha of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that throws light into the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the basis additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but, as he said, it's not about history.
These are mostly the words of Emmy Lazarus, who resonate today - calling them not only the immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let anyone fall to me, let anyone fall, let anyone who is freely breathing, let anyone who is poor in the midst of cities.”
And just in modern times, we can look better on these “famines” on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of the soil is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who tried to put a poem on the base of the poem after her death, knew quite well that she was going to a high political game.
Socha had to express the association of the French and American Republican government by representing a classic theme, i.e., women's bodybuilding of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this significance: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of the Avengers.
The combining of poetry with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist target and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the significance of the soil, the right-wing leader long seeks to distort this significance.
In 2010, the famous commentator Rush Limbaugh, Jan Baptist, argued that Socha Freedom does not actually bring anybody into the country, but represents early neo-constructionalism, bringing an American flame to the rest of the world: “Socha Freedom goes ahead.
It brings the origin of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The origin does not illuminate the way to the United States.”
The Limbaugh Cupid is a matter of importance.
The importance of the soil depends on the angle of the view.
Emma Lazarus describes the socket from the perspective of an exhausted and cursed traveler who many times, after a long and terrifying swimming across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart into the new land.
This is literally a world view in the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, he expresses a sorcery of hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump will certainly not know.
Their origin does not have to illuminate the path, but to irritate hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup athletics: Neil Black sings praise for Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, head of the United Kingdom’s Athletics Federation, said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be “a huge benefit for the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the MS in London 2017, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that in Scotland, something special is happening, and British athletes can learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt to it - we'll work on it," Black said.
“I talked to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People in the streets also think about it.
Whatever it is, it’s totally amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laury Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in a race of 5,000 meters, while Eilidh Doyle was elected Captain of the team.
“They will be modest.
Her initial speech was incredible,” Black said.
A number of athletes, whether Scottish or athletes from other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of huge pride and motivation.
Your feelings and the uncovered feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeated.”
The Silver Medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in a 400-meter obstacle race at its fifth World Cup, said it was "unbelievable" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muir has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in a run of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500-meter track. This season, he won British team races and Annual Games.
Doyle remembers her first championship in which she was the only Scottish member of Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues were joined in the team, but in many cases they would be attacked at the same time as participating in the finals and medals.
"It's unusual to be the captain of the team that I was chosen by other team members. It was a great honour for me, but the consciousness that I was chosen by the team members is delightful," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved.
They are athletes who will think of the front positions on the stadium.
What about my introduction?
Yeah, I think she did it.
I just pointed to the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to use the support of home fans and to rejoice that we are back to the Olympic Stadium.
I got the second chance to go to the race and I’ll enjoy an amazing atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t worry about public function if you don’t criticize voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic policy and ending with his political opinions.
This criticism did not leave her cold.
But he wasn't trying to quiet criticism.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression can be removed from us – and foolishly, and we will be led as sheep to defeat.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start behaving like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, it was appealed by the U.S. Union for Civil Liberties.
The Governor’s employees rejected the complaint as an unreasonable, and many of the views of "who is interested in" have appeared in comments on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
However, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolute democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can be praised for the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan isn't addicted.
As it is seen, its state governs its own self-confidence and strictly adheres to the principles.
It has also been shown to be reversible in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even to publish the first photo with a hollow head after completion of chemotherapy.
The blocking of people on the Governor’s website – which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview for Washington Post Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by blocking comments from the position of moderating contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or distorted people is too easy.
The Washington Post told a number of real people who had deleted posts.
And exactly that is - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teacher, entrepreneur and pastor, no trolls.
As all of them said, their comments were ridiculous and discreet, not abusive.
The pastor cited the Bible in his commentary, calling on Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani’s lawyer, Md., asked for hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I’ve been disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports,” she wrote in the Washington Post commentary section.
“I don’t like the idea that as soon as a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are designated to promote so-called collective efforts, rather than to be recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the Governor’s employees called a “centred spam rate” would probably be called “obhajoba”.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past when the same procedure would require the sending of employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for hacking Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a complaint by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoun County Board of Supervisors broke the first addition in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented access to one of the voters on her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also waited for visits from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
During Washington’s time, the low price of the post was almost the same as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily prints multiplied and his position as a leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
Even at that time, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people under the online Papers of George Washington Project, in his office, five were collected criticising his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation Agreement with the UK.
But he did not quiet them.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and fear lie in the foundations of our nation itself.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs consume more from their rates abroad than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is the Duke of Croatia.
On holidays, however, they have more time to browse on the site, and under the sunshine, they are usually not able to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bath and a smartphone in your hand.
This looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can take advantage of the services of those operators at home prices.
This is based on O2’s fresh statistics.
Thanks to new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the space than at home.
It’s not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of people travel over the winter, the consumption of data has risen up to fifty times in this summer season.
The second place in the number of consumed data was Italy.
Most of the minutes the Czechs are provoking from Germany, where many of them are expelled at work even during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Offices, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences via mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7.
"Dozens of millions of photos would be in the transferred data," said O2 Silvia Cieslar's mobile segment director.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users moves in neighbouring countries.
The first is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
In Austria, we are exhibiting for a hiking tourism and an active holiday, where we don’t have so much time to browse on the internet.
"In addition, the Czechs are going to the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While the operator recorded high inter-annual growth in data after release of roaming fees, the growth is much lower in phone calls.
The number of minutes in roaming rose to double compared to last year.
With a huge jump in front of other countries here, Germany dominates.
"Roaming campaigns are rather used by business customers on business roads," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home at Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Rafferty golf course will hope in a comfortable atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administration area East Lothian, which will host the 25th anniversary of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, originating in Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course, followed Paul Eales in the final. This year he will play the role of the tournament ambassador in the representation of the club founder and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve been watching how the Renaissance Club slowly grows in front of me, and this year’s tournament will show the world of his beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the top quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a burning defender of this game and is proud of his success.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
The English Eales will first defend the master’s title, despite winning the European Tour and European Challenge Tour during its 32-year-old career.
“I feel good about it,” said Southport golfer.
“I had no chance to defend my victory at Extremadura Open because a year after my victory was cancelled.
The return to this part of the land is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon and my wife really made a lot of winning.
It was a beautiful time I couldn’t forget.”
Gary Orr returns to the homeland, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the end of this year.
This event will be his first part of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to be able to feel a lot of pressure.
I really like to play again and I think I can do it.
I am pleased with the result so far."
The three players are also joined by the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior tournaments winner Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the square; others include Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
Tour entry is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian country of gold
When Bardina Degei eats dinner, she doesn't use a dinner.
In fact, it rarely uses pain.
In its wooden chattery, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali, in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually fits a sweet potato - in the word of local "notes" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, take a potato out and taste it with uncomfortable hands.
Bardina sits on a flowery land - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time he performs his daily work, such as washing wash in dipped water from a distant urea.
A bathtub in a room without a roof is fitted with a toilet.
As the youngest of four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamia is common here.
Working in late night hours is a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, in the village, soldiers live.
“Now at 5 p.m. no one will allow you to walk around the village,” Bardina said.
It is a rare view of the daily life of Papui, the former Dutch colony, which was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public lifting of hands before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned his anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papuu and Western Papuu – the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is so distant and devastated city, where you get after ninety minutes of flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach shining by car.
Public transportation in this place does not work.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo plots, roofs from wave plates in shades of grey and cut colors.
There were very few Indonesians, but journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, local residents worshiped the god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardina, showing his colorful, hand-picked turban, dark shirt and lightweight dress.
“We were wearing only a sheet before.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives under the poverty limit, and there is child mortality and greed one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold bowl Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenician, is located only 60 miles from Paniai – a rocked province of approximately the size of New Jersey, which is home to approximately 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport earned $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated $78 billion.
However, these treasures are a source of suffering and guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey, Freeport paid $20 million to local military agents and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden hush and are therefore hardly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands of others have been raped, trapped and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in the Papui tribe area during the 1970s were equal to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only last year, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the 2016 report of the Brisban Archbishop, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as extra-modern arrests, torture - according to another report - is particularly popular rape and electrical arrest - and brutal oppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has difficulty the fact that Popean sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demographics are changing with the flow of Muslim immigrants from Indonesian islands - Javier, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan cantines sell brown chickens and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with arachid potatoes.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants began selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains the four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The original people of Papuy - mother-mom (women) - lost their job."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is renamed Jokowi, promised in his 2014 presidential campaign to resolve inequality and infringement of rights.
The former teacher also secured his journey to the Presidential Palace in Jakar 27 of the 29 districts of Papui, including Paniai.
But in Papouasi, it has changed very little, and the locals feel depressed.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that only two months after the October inauguration of Jakobi, Paniai experienced a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children singed a Christmas song at the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers dropped out of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them that they should turn off the lights.
One of the soldiers touched this excavation and tone, which was torn out and later returned with four other soldiers, local lighter Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the underlying state persecuted a group of children, killing them with the guns of their arms, bringing victims and witnesses to the events.
One of the soldiers then burned on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was kidnapped so strongly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, somebody burned the nearby building of the electoral committee, and the next day things were still out.
Around 1,000 young Popean men and women gathered at the football court in front of the local police station and military command and demanded justice.
They came with the glorious hunting holes and performed a waita dance - in which it runs in the circle and the singing of the birds - the Papuan village of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones on the building.
As a result of the tension, the soldiers were given an order via the radio: “If a date attempts at least three times the resistance, you have permission to shoot,” according to the weekly TIME, the official document whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of Enarotali district Kego Koto, recognized the threatening dangers and urged the inhabitants to move into their homes.
But no one answered his words.
"When I turned, someone shot me in the left belt," he said in a weekly TIME on the veranda of his pesterly painted wooden house.
Kayame has not yet known who was a shooter, but, according to his words, the ball belonged to one of the present soldiers.
“There were a lot of people around, and a lot of people were shot,” he added.
One of the local residents, Alphius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the shooting.
"I ran to the body to convince me that it's really him," said Johann, a weekly laughing voice, who, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
Police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officials only "assured" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us to die," said a press spokesman from the Poland Police in 2015, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The report of murders appealed to the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi expressed a passionate speech in Jayapur and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised he would deal with violence in Papui.
"I want to solve this problem immediately so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security, Wiranto, announced that it would introduce an outsourcing mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began to apologize.
“Most of the violence has happened a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are committed to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task,” he said.
In an interview of June 5, for the week of TIME held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to take any measures in Papou.
Instead of saying that “all cases will be presented to the court.”
Wiranto, who accused the UN of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than one thousand dead during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papou, including an incident in Paniai, have been equated.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his allegations with uncertainty.
“In the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but so far I haven’t seen anything,” John said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, he lives in fear a few years later.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many people Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to his words, he was killed by the members of the army after he helped to bury four of the victims.
After the burial of the body, the army began to seek me.
And the shooting isn't standing yet.
Indonesian police fired nearby villagers in Deiyai on Tuesday.
One person died and 17 others were injured, a hit between the villager and the construction company manager, who refused to provide assistance in carrying a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who dropped in fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The villagers protested in front of the building.
According to police statements, the villagers threw stones and answers to them were a warning shooting.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting into a dam and killed one person.
“Panic has occurred, we were afraid of paying,” said Dominggu Badi, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and was witness to the arrival of the injured.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyaan parliament demanded the punishment of the involved police and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The lady had always been in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples from the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in central heights.
Many of them joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM) - the Army of the rebels, which protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Ladyai. They are not Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks of the army in recent years, thousands of Paniai residents have been arrested and arbitrarily detained, all under the "security of national sovereignty".
Some of them will never see again.
Among the people of Papuai is known as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil is burning in the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is equally inaccessible.
The residents here grow their foods: mostly sweet potatoes, fruits and leaf vegetables.
Women work on the fields; each of them cares about four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most slides are designed for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupee (75 cents).
Since Nabire has opened several airlines and new immigrants have started flowing into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between parents and immigrants.
As a result, few jobs usually have more educated and rich immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of the village because of the lack of employment opportunities and money,” said John Gobai, Chairman of the Panai Tribal Council.
Thanks to insulation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp, were expelled from the papyrus for the reasons of “deficiency of cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received so rare authorization for filming.
Phelim Kine, Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi promised abolition of strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development in his election campaign.
“Free journalists who work in the upstairs eastern areas of Papui and Western Papui are at a high risk: non-recognition of visas and black listing,” he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in the case of Papui is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread violence" in Papou, including shooting in Paniai.
In the past, these countries have also supported the OPM.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accused journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to strike evidence of violations of human rights.”
Local people call for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Emissary for Human Rights, Kees Van Baarem, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals provoked according to a source that also participated in the session, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
In 2019, further elections are scheduled in Indonesia, but the Pope says they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with a shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the residents of Mrs. Lady - in addition to living in constant fear of the robbing army - are valid in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the residents of Mrs. Lady, as well as the other Papuans, consider their voice as “debt,” which Jokowi has to pay.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidations of the family of the victims, the pandemic shooting continues in the last symbolic act of the rebellion: they buried the bodies of the victims on the ground against police and military stations.
With the consciousness that justice will never be made enough, at least will not allow responsible persons to forget their crimes.
“I was killed by a member of our family,” Yacobus said with a sharp head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy retained a Pacific yacht of 1.46 tons of cocaine worth $ 256 million.
The shipment went to Australia.
The intervention was arrested by a four-member crew of a ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
Jachta, known as Afalina, fled from South America and police drove her to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian reporting service said it would, in cooperation with its international partners, strive to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going, and to reveal the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large amount of drugs to Australia," said the executive director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia, due to its high street prices of drugs, is an attractive goal for their shepherds.
The earth is also faced with an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
This isn't the first time in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia who tried to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Elderly people don’t feel thirsty, drinking must be reminded of them.
This may be a problem in the homes for seniors, a solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádl, could be infusions of a physiological solution that beaten by a thin needle under the skin.
They are still only used in medical facilities.
The older a person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"And in addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally receive less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Madlová said.
Two liters should be drinking.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In the homes for seniors, it is often not a doctor who cares about it.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated by infusions.
"I think there should be a gradual introduction in order to receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
In a day, it says that older people can add up to two half-liter bottles of a physiological solution.
Liquid deficiency can cause malnutrition, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration is manifested as a total loss of self-esteem.
"One day the old man says he can't get up out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In the event of negligence, it can lead to a brain accident.
Blood is swallowed up and the vessel in the brain is also at risk of kidney failure.
Patients lining should not be covered with a pearl, maximum cotton cloth.
The problem can also be one-time balls.
"It is more medically demanding, but it would be ideal for the patient to sometimes open up and let the skin wind up," the doctor said.
The Torch has been fired for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the largest inhabited clouds in the world was found in flames on Friday. Hasiči had to evacuate all the inhabitants of 337 meters high and 79 floor buildings.
In the last two years, this is already the second fire of this height building, which bears a suitable name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated, and no injury occurred; the cause of the fire is not known.
“We slept and awakened the alarm. We heard the screaming.
It took us ten minutes to run down the 50th floor,” said Reuters Geroge, one of the people of the cloud.
The Dubai Civil Defense said it managed to get fire under control about four o'clock in the morning (0:00 GMT), and continued cooling the building.
Government officials added that they provide substitute accommodation for disabled people.
The incident could again raise discussions on the safety of materials used to cover height buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which started the Torch cloud drive after the fire in 2015, showed that the coverage and external panels used to decorate or isolate were most damaged.
The British police said the system of isolation and coverage of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed nearly 80 people.
The survey has shown that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. delivers banned items on planes
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 percent of the passengers consciously or unconsciously passed banned objects through the U.S. Government Transportation Security Administration's control station on aircraft. At least 6 percent of passengers entered a plane with a knife or another sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they’ve found delayed travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which responded to more than 1,000 questionnaire - showed that younger passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to attempting to travel consciously with an object that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of passengers with several thousand hours of emergency compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of Generation X.
The most common items that avoid TSA attention include food and alcohol.
More than 3 percent of respondents consciously passed a sharp subject, while 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men also admitted that they deliberately dropped drugs on board aircraft.
The company said it conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized objects through airport checks and how much they did so in a row.
It’s not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized items – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel on the plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA directives are slightly complicated and distorted.
People often don’t know what fluids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA has enjoyed the largest amount of just forbidden liquids.
For a certain time, people thought that TSA would load books in the same way as with the pastured goods.
Liquid transfer is allowed within domestic flights, not international.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the delay of planned directives on reducing emissions by the Obama Administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency has been charged by fifteen states, her head Scott Pruitt revoked its previous decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration plan for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes within its plan, and reacts more fraudulently than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This applies to the last date laid down on 1 October, when States should begin implementing a 2015 regulation for reducing the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that the agreement will be delayed for one year and will order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “assets with local decisions or threatening economic growth”.
Pruitt, who, before reaching the role of EPA chief Donald Trump, served as State Attorney-General Oklahoma for a long time as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or removed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden Wednesday turnover is the biggest legal failure for the Pruitt regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA executive overturned its authority in an attempt to remove Obama’s administration’s integration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane escapes.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to cooperate with States through complex processes and compliance with new standards within a given time frame.
“For the previous administration of the EPA government, it often did not complete the deadlines and waited for it to be charged by activist groups and others, in agreement with the comparison and further setting of plans,” Pruitt, who lodged more than a dozen complaints to the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulations by means of court disputes and we take the term seriously.
We never talk about our statute and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA’s statement states that Pruitt can at a certain point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations will be “based on a healthy policy and the most accessible information”.
Republicans in Congress press on a broader overview of ozone rules.
The budget of the White House approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The action has not yet been passed by the Senate.
New York’s Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who was headed by the coalition of states who appealed to the EPA this week, said the group was unwilling to allow under legal pressure.
“Training in EPA’s opinions, following our judicial overseas, is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by cars, plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists have a sudden change in Pruit’s flower with thanks.
“It’s worried what pressure we need to develop to change the thoughts of responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd at the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against Trump’s ideological restraint, trying to help pollutants and special interests.”
Polish the man with acid, yet it is not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one point, you are home with your family and you are laughing, at the other time, your whole life will change from the foundations.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything with that at all.
A similar fate met Andrease Christopherose from the UK, whose face was improved by an unknown assault, who was finally released for guilt.
The information was introduced by the web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone at Christopheros locked the door.
Andreas got up and said he was going to open.
He thought there was probably a currior behind the door, who had to deliver Christmas gifts that day to the family.
Instead, a cruel surprise was waiting for him.
A man who has never seen him in his life immediately after opening him without warning, he felt acid with the word, "This is for you, friend."
The pain was unwritten.
"The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt an incredible pain on the skin," Andreas said.
The family quickly brought him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible report - according to the doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer from an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Of ninety percent, the face that doctors tried to put together with the skin from other parts of the patient’s body was affected.
A major complication for Christopherose has become the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most harsh thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said.
Today, Christopheros has twelve operations that are not the last.
Accidents that suffer from acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical operations and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after long-term and long-term treatment, the victims of tissue have been detected for the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people don't go back and fight deformation and dizziness throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker collapsed.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man had to deal with someone.
Pachatel believed that he was a man who had sexually abused his neighbour.
The police investigated the whole case and the attacker subsequently investigated.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years of prison.
However, later, the value of the admiration of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be cancelled because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks on fats has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed itself on the issue, planning to establish new guidelines to the State Representatives on the classification of the juice.
These should be classified among dangerous weapons.
The victims of similar attacks do not agree to give up.
They require the UK government to impose stricter and longer punishments on the removal of freedom to people who attack their surroundings with acid or other nuts.
They also require that the sales of hazardous substances, which are often common to be received in different stores, be thoroughly controlled, as these are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai has burned the famous cloud The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the eighty-eighth building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman from the Dubai Police, a fire broke out on the nine floor and spread upwards.
However, according to a number of residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started at the 67th floor, that's how they told us," one of the renters said.
Also, according to another renter, quoted by the Reuters agency, the fire broke out in the highest spots and spread down with falling bubbles.
We've been sleeping.
We were awakened, people shouted.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," George said.
Other witnesses for CNN estimated that the flames had accumulated about 40 apartments.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when the fire parts of the building were affected by them.
About two hours later, according to a civil defense statement, the fire was controlled.
The cause of its emergence is not yet known.
According to the witnesses, the stream fell in the surrounding buildings.
An extensive fire damaged the Dubai cloud crash The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Nothing happened at that time, because the people were able to evacuate at the time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 meters highest residential building in the world.
The record was prepared by another Dubai cloud crash next year.
The bodybuilder had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win.
According to the Corriere della Serra, an Ippolita, a thirty-two-year-old sample, a pest of unauthorized drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn’t help him to get the title, the fourth ended.
The bodybuilder now threatens a four-year distance and criminal investigation.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbist Davide Vasta was positively tested on 11 doping substances, which was a record quantity of the hit athletes.
The third player began to take steroids a year before he collapsed in bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčkova in Czech Republic.
She was talking about her former lover!
Lucka Vondráčkova barely entered the territory of Czechia, is in one bike.
It also attracts attention to wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into her arms, her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
At the time, he was 12 years old and wanted his family.
Lucia was then only 19 years old and definitely didn’t want to place her career on the ground.
They left, but friends remained so far.
What they also did at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
Both of them were soaked in blue.
First they didn't notice themselves, but then they came closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal's garlics when she fell behind her stomach.
They were afraid, and they were willing to post the photographers.
However, their meetings weren’t accidental, for they play together a loving couple in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
Islamists have experienced in the UK for the preparation of the assault.
The British court sent four members of the Islamic cells, called Three Muskets, and the prosecutor planned a terrorist attack on the police and army on Thursday.
Four men, two of whom participated in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar actions, were arrested in August last year.
The authorities believed that they were about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, with knives that in Arabic means "unbelievers", and a maket of a gun.
This happened at the moment when the MI5 secret service agent put the listening device in the car.
"Recent attacks have shown what horror the accused could cause if they weren't stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three sentences aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after twenty years.
The fourth convicted, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind the nets.
During the London trial, the men said they were innocent and that the guns found in the car were placed there by MI5.
The court also listened to him, but the charges of the accused rejected him.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodonisk, 38.3 °C was measured.
The temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, recorded in the Watchtower of Hodon, it exceeded Thursday, which thus became the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the employees of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
However, there were no many temperature records on Tuesday.
The records were overcome or balanced on Tuesday to 35 out of 145 weather stations measured for over 30 years.
There were only nine long-term temperatures recorded on Thursday.
Although the temperature of Thursday was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica in Brzeclavska on Thursday, the original maximum exceeded 37.4 degrees by four tens of degrees, and in Pohorzeliks in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees by three tens of degrees.
Both records as well as in the Watchtower came from 2013.
In the west, it was 10 degrees less.
High temperatures occurred on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Morava.
After the Watchtower, the largest lead was in Dyyakovics on Znojemska and Boda nad Dyji in Brzeclavska, where the rota was consistently expanded to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
For example, in the western and northern Czechs, the highest temperatures of Thursday were only about 22 degrees Celsius, according to the website of the Czech Republic.
“The temperatures began to rise until now later in the afternoon,” meteorologians said.
Current leads in the Czech Republic will gradually be reflected, and even more significant rain may occur on Sunday.
In most places in Morava, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Morava on Saturday.
China is missing tourists.
Beijing is about billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to apply its influence without using force resources.
He spends ten billion dollars annually to support language schools and universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry to foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing isn't going to happen.
There are state media talking about a plan to make tourism a force of economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of visitors rose by only 3.8%, and about 80% of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, by the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not congratulate foreigners just with open arms, assessing the situation in the world’s most humane country, professor of economics at the University of Beijing, Christopher Balding, in the article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a visa-free contact with China, and citizens of the other countries have to provide a visa with a prejudice.
The Chinese authorities in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if a person doesn’t want to wait for long hours in front, he has to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study of the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa decreases the number of visitors in the country by 70 per cent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited China’s fortune, while Hong Kong, which has less than three percent shares in China’s gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepened this problem itself when tourism is used to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transportation to South Korea in spring, as part of a raid around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans dropped it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits decreased by 42% annually, while Japan saw an increase of 85%.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the US Central Bank, China could leave up to $ 190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China earns about $ 35 billion annually as part of the sale of currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the payment balance, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equivalent to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade with goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists in a country that anxiously prevents the inflammatory of capital is causing a very painful injury.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general sustainability to foreigners.
In many places, China has almost never heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
There are more cities in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not just a crossing immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific research shows that immigrants are usually reviving economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
In China, however, you can’t find them.
Solving these problems will be politically demanding, but the step offered is to simplify the visa device.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and reduce visas procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plennin Zoo, there were deadly jedied beaches.
The Plzhen Kingdom can enjoy three rare, deadly poisonous beaches.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only nine of the newly born Turkish disappearances so far.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an overseas height of 2,000 meters.
"It's growing and metre length," said Zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
Youths of the other two species, mortals and red cows, will still gain power in the garden’s cultivation background.
We can't say when people see them yet.
"We wouldn't like to take care of them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian snakes died in the world eight, which are the seeds of a pair of breeding from the population around Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the deadliest of Perth," Vobruba said in human care that wintering is necessary for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
The 100 percent success led to a dream of African swim cobras red.
The pair of the Plennin Zoo was out of four eggs of a total of four youths.
"The incubation took 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature excites tooth on its victims, up to four meters away.
It looks at the eyes, it can cause up to a lasting blindness.
Youths of all three species live in the zoo with hola mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, youths are still waiting for a black mammy dream, eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an uncertain telephone interview, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for paying for border walls
The American newspaper Washington Post has published a resuming of President Trump's telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview with Mexican President Enrique Peñou Niet, Trump urged her to stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president told him that he publicly condemned the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like this in the press."
Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also escaped his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing the tension of exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. oversight agreement on refugees to Australia is "joking" and "dumb" and insists that if he agrees with such an agreement - which has come up with President Obama's government - he would seem to be "arrogant" after he proposed the US entry ban.
Trump concluded the call after he explained to Turnbull that "This is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk spoke again to the prosecutor for Smolensk.
"There's nothing to worry about," he said on the address of the brother of the deceased president, the President of the Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not scare me," Tusk said in a statement to the current government of the country that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the prosecutor’s headquarters, he waited for Tuska according to TVN 24 dav, who scanned Donald Tusk! and wished for the politician for a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to worry about and Kaczyński won't scare me."
It counts nothing to the prosecutors according to his words, but it does not doubt that justice has to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, oppositions, or people who do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
It was the second time in the interview.
The prosecutor was already heard in the prosecutor's second time, and this time he had to be heard about doubts in the slaughter of the victims of the smolen catastrophe.
In addition, there was a replacement of the body in the bulbs.
Families were forbidden to open their wagons and there had to be some reasons for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because they would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Management of good relationships at any cost, despite such a terrifying event, had to serve Donald Tusk to become a very important person in the EU," Kaczyński said in a Catholic TV.
He added that the potential conflict with Russia would deprive Tusk of the chances of obtaining the most important chair in the Union, but Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that with Donald Tusk it could affect differently, but did not notice it.
Tusk held an eight-hour hearing at the prosecutor on 19 April.
He did not speak as a suspect, but as a witness.
However, many of his appeals to listen were considered part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and Chief PiS Kaczyńsky to discredit Tuscany as a political rival in connection with various scandals.
The prosecution is in Poland undertaken by the Minister of Justice, who plays the role of the Prosecutor-General.
The call for an interrogation took place after the election of Tuska as the head of the European Council, which Kaczyński was endeavoring to avoid, among other things, when he visited Merkel in Warsaw.
Finally, at the EU summit against the extension of Tuscany’s mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beat Szydl protested lonely.
In this case, he left Warsaw on the holists as well as the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote everywhere?
In autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to newly vote on the composition of the House of Barmy, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a statement that adjusts the delivery of voting tickets to foreigners.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently in commentary proceedings.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens were elected abroad.
"There have been some changes in these lists since the last novelization of the statement in 2013," the ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the report said.
The declaration shall contain two annexs, of which the first is indicated by the representative authorities to which paper voting tickets are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a voting ticket in the print version.
Their list is just changing with the application.
For example, four years ago, the Czechs could vote in the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassys are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in Malaysian Bamak and Japan Kyoto.
He will not vote at the General Consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 for war in eastern Ukraine.
They are new to the list of embassies in Kenya Nairobi, the capital of Senegal Dakar and Lusace of Zambia.
Since last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation of the consulate general in Iraqi Irbili and Čcheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-čhuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassy in Barma and Cambodia.
The Czechs had the opportunity to elect members in election rooms in representative offices or consulars four times so far.
Before every election of the state election committee, the country for which the candidates are voted abroad will be destined.
This was the first time in 2002 when the South Moravia candidates decided.
In the following two elections, the Czech Republic was elected abroad among the Southern candidates.
In 2013, the Central Republic was chosen as well as this year.
The number of Czech voters abroad is growing stable.
At the premiere 15 years ago, approximately 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 about 6,700, four years later 8222.
Four years ago, the Embassy of 10,571 voters took place in the early parliamentary elections.
Moore's Ford's bridge massacre: Activists Remind Racist lynching
The Ford Mercury of 1948 passed around the viewing Monroe, Georgie, and crossed towards Moore's Ford bridge.
But before the car with four passengers of black leather and a white driver stopped arriving at the bridge, a group of white men with arms made his way to the garden.
The group’s leader – a middle-aged man in a swallowed clothes – for a long time crashed out of a cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside the passengers were scared.
“We want that... Roger!” the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
Quietly breaks the rise of a young black man who is pulled out of the seat of a traveler.
Fortunately, this scene is just the reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men passes through "Roger's" throat, obesity breathes up with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists who rebuild that night of fate in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed Kukluxklan members.
No one has been sentenced for murder yet.
“It’s surprising that there hasn’t been one person arrested over all those years – although we still see them in our community; although we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps reorganize the event.
“It’s a burden on our history and burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgian state congressman and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to take place, reminding the city community of Monroe that justice has not been done enough.
"We require a court appeal and close the case, we want peace in mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started.”
Judge physician covers one of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI, the NBC News report, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts had to take part in the lynching.
However, no one has been appealed to the court yet.
Although the suspects have remained in freedom for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both the reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, according to the Supreme Court’s decision, the residents of the state of Georgia’s black skin for the first time were given the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer elections, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom had to beat the owner of the land of the white leather of Barnett Hester - allegedly for his wife.
According to Brookse, Hester was accustomed to raising Malcom's wife Dorothy and bringing her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then prominent land owner of the white skin Loy Harrison for Malcom's cash for $600.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When he returned from prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford bridge, a group of suspects had been gardened on their way.
"How it turned out, the murder planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that a secret agreement has been reached between state and local law enforcement officers who have not only participated in the lynching, but also get rid of evidence and hid the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks expressed the whole issue shorter.
“It was a mass because of the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtext for all local people of black skin: ‘This is how you will get if you register and go to vote.’”
Annual renovation of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
It shows deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Tracking this reconstruction is not easy and it is even harder to reverse sight, but Greene says that it has a sense.
“Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that hide in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there cannot be a relationship between us, unless you listen to what I had to go through.”
The main tests of this year’s reconstruction began in June and immediately on the first day, about 30 actors – dozens of whites, the rest of blacks – entered the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned presentation.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director.
For many years, the leader of Kukluxklan played, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad because it's opposed to who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to come back to such a time.”
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, like Barnett Hester, exercise their roles.
The presentation begins with a pocket - Malcom negotiates with Hester and blames him to sleep with his wife.
“Go out of my land...”
Rascona can't.
It's happening.
At the moment, all (at least every actor of black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
“No,” Greene said.
“I just don’t think the white people then called ‘n-r’ in such a tone.”
“Precisously,” one of the actors will scream black skin.
“You have to put more emphasis on R.”
The energy in the room is at once better; hostility replaces the feeling of proximity.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done after four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word in N.
No one laughs anymore.
The presentation ends violently and quickly.
The row, the shooting... and the next silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the tricky Billie Holiday song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, it feels sad in the room.
At the back of this, about dozens of viewers lose the pot and tears from their eyes.
There is almost the same number of blacks and whites in obesity.
One pair of travelers arrived from New York Ithacy, many sights are from the nearby.
Each of them tolerate the local moisture of nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until that moment, murders could have been seen with retreat, but now, standing in the same place where lynching occurred, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene will invite the body inspections.
Children climbing to the heads of the victims, watching false blood, and non-feeling bodies, and shaking something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy rushed.
It'll take a few minutes, and Greene's thanks to obesity.
The actors clean the lane and shake tears.
Bradshaw covers Marbaugha, the man in a dress that played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona takes two of his friends and wept in their arms; ultimately, emotions fall on him.
“It’s okay,” one of the women shouts.
“We know that this role is due to you.
But you had a reason for that."
Later on the same day, obesity will meet together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is busy talking about a presentation with a black couple whom they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feelings from today’s performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those shameful words and look at those shameful deeds . . . that people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said to the reconstruction.
“I need to realize that lynching is still a topic,” she added, “the only thing they call it police crashes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying the dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he began to plan the show for the next year.
“Reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it is at the same time a moment to think,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from that who knows... that could happen again.
People who don’t know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says the instructions for use are just reading srab.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often shattered by surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the past times, where the instructions for use of anything was rather a rare order.
So, for example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which the hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, all had some secret brands.
When something broke in me for years, I offered the sheet to Shaman, who wasn't afraid to scratch the back.
He told me with a sticker what the paper with a labyrinth is suitable for.
Yes, it was a regular help in the chronic display of toilet paper.
He found a diluted wire toughly and allowed me to listen again to the expensive vinyl plates.
The new era brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit distiller, which simply kept the overwhelming grep, required about ten images.
It was particularly a plan with a description of how to cover one part into the other.
The competition was two-party and another procedure was simply not possible.
On the contrary, it required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My violations of the instructions ended in my self-movement of Seat Leon.
In the year of 2003, he had a princess with a guide to small repairs, including the exchange of blinc lamps.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work had to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions reminded that while the lamp right went to really only in three steps.
1. separate the cover.
2. explode the brush lamp and screw the new.
3. the cover.
The lamp left had a problem in the form of the location of the battery.
Initially, I thought that I would put the right upper end into the car's intrusion with a shaft, a screw with which it is easy to cover, and then I'll be running points 1-3 of the saving author's service book.
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
The cover had no place, no space for the sharp Popelchin's lunch, even the obsessed Slezana.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The state was still strengthened by the entry of my wife into the garage, called by ryk and words that hear from my mouth completely exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked jealousy.
My response took about 90 seconds, however, if I leave a vulgar term, only two publishable words remained.
I'm changing the light.
"And why does it take you so long?" she risked the sentence, which in a long-term union may be her last.
I slowly explained her the problem, focusing on the torture process of the author of the instructions, where the blessing of the dissolved iron on the hand which the instructions wrote, followed by her encouragement so that she could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions of Kladiv on the sorcery of the Losses.
"What do you do to uninstall the box?" said the woman to uninstall the battery.
In a clear despair this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought he couldn't surprise me.
And until the day a colleague called me, who had just talked about the collapse after checking two offices of the State Department of Drug Control.
I know him as a co-worker of balance, who has experienced possible and impossible in the field, and who is able to interpret wild stories with an unexpected voice.
"Please imagine I received a penalty for not having a hand wash instructions," he said with a weak voice.
I gradually evolved from him the whole problem that raised in the fact that he had no picture guide over the washing toilet of patients.
His arguments by the Commission’s officials that adults do wash their hands usually understand and that the lack of pictograms to manage the usual activity of decent people had no harmful effect and had little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He realized that the simple wash of the hand-drawn flowing with water is a primitive action at the level of the chromanic that man is modern, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremonies in ten steps.
Therefore, it is necessary to say that it is necessary to leave the water from the cave.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is glad to find that a man washed his hands exactly as a SUK’s boss ordered him.
Finally, I have to submit that I’ve left my inspiration and I’m preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the issue of defection, the procedure is uniform, there the problem will not occur, in urination, due to certain differences between both genders, the instructions will be required to apply two.
The problem remains with those pictograms, as creating a perfect procedure also means a precise drawing of all anatomical details, which could awaken to the careful visitor of the toilet a certain relapse, despite the fact that he can finally find out that he has exhausted the respective hole throughout his life with a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will release another 3,000 employees and reduce dividend in order to rebuild trade
The British Pearson Education Group said on Friday it would release another 3000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of release, which, according to the statement of Executive Director John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4,000 employees within the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to reduce costs by additional £300 million (394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to raise a decline in trade as a result of strong development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House at Bertelsmann last month, said that the prospect of this year remained unchanged after announcing a single percentage increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Kabul, Afghanistan, and one NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, official officials said.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, NATO said.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during the attack in Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan’s bombing attack - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a herat mosque on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
In a statement, NATO said the explosion occurred on Tuesday after the guard was attacked by “a local person with a home-made explosive equipment”.
The statement further states that all the injuries of the soldiers are outside of life threatening and are located in the U.S. military hospital at the Baghram Air Base.
According to the reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concern for NATO’s allied forces in the nearby Baghdad.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of which died in the capital.
At the end of July, a bomb was killed in a car located at least 30 people in Shia’s Kabul district.
Taliban joined the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people have been killed in the city centre. This is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the U.S. units defeated the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence has already undergone such a suspicious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops that should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to reporters, suicide attacks that he has learned in recent weeks of public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
EPA, in response to the complaint, reviewed its decision to dismiss smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to delay the Obama Administration Act, which ordered States to reduce emissions, only a day after the agency was charged by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to introduce the Ozone Standards 2015, saying it would submit an Agency’s commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe in dialogue with our national partners and we will listen to their opinions," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s efforts to dismiss ozone standards – measuring real air pollution in specific areas of the country and determined the limits to be met by October 2018.
The group of fifteen of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint on Tuesday, arguing that the EPA negotiations are illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to avoid many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama – according to Trump’s words in an attempt to overcome economic growth.
However, the new government has launched anti-actions by Democrats and conservative groups, fearing the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that air breathing with ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got wounds and flowed blood!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this nearly unknown singer has arranged for the Czech conditions of a monstrous event hosted by Mr. Karel Gott, Lucie White Mare, Simona Krain and many others, and no one else.
The purpose was simple, showing the public and presenting his music video to the song Sara, whose baptism has grown just named personalities.
But few people already know that the video recording itself that took place in Russia did not have any problems, and singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big tournament with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it did not happen without a good trap.
Sarah’s song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticness of the scene, the singer's juice in the video had to indicate the hit of facky.
At one point, however, he hit him so strongly and straight into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by the doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, she immediately dropped out of my nose," Ladislav said.
The colleagues and producers said that it was an accident and Ladislav did not respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury wasn’t so serious that it would affect the continuation of the next recording.
This video of a young artist we are bringing to you now, you can also record the scene with a hit.
The unpredictable version with the blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko talked about mutual duel options at a meeting
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could launch the most exciting boxer match in light weight, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN’s offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia – an undefeated champion in a lightweight World Boxing Council – was sitting down into the hall where he welcomed the Romanian, a champion in a pearlweight World Boxing Organization.
After Garcio's one-stop decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in the Saturday Showtime match, both boxers were listed on the list of five of the best boxers in light weight.
Garcia turned her right and said, “How is it, champion?
Good luck."
He defended his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers post for photographers and manager of Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight for boxers would be a “perfect test”.
"I'm a former champion in a pearl weight," Garcia adds.
“Due to the fight against Broner (67 kg) I had to go back, but I’m not so big.
I'm small at 63 pounds.
I would like to go back to the lightweight category.
We have to go back home to get a lightweight... then we can run away.
The fans are looking for that.
Why don't you do that?"
The Romanian agrees.
"Boxus would have benefited from this match."
Climas has raised a request for payment for review - which is part of its strategy. The Romanian should take its debut in a light weight at the end of this year and run with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts) next year, which also expressed interest in the match against the winners of the duo, which is the 23rd forum with Jorge Linares vs. Luke vs. Campze.
"The soap should be in the way of paying for watching, that's what fans are demanding," Garcia, who later expressed that the possibility of broadcasting the game through a TV station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We're waiting for the right opportunity..."
Garcia stated that he recognized the Romanian as a "admirable boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But the Romanian didn't give Garcia's glory to cope when he said that the Riverside three divisions champion looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show the strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension in front of each other.
“Don’t forget about this game.
No other match will pay so much attention to yourself.
And I am very pleased to put in the fire,” Garcia said.
He said, "I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It will be a great match."
The young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
Their car was now found at the bottom of Volhy.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was a huge search for them, but without success.
And the police finally stopped for the lack of evidence of the investigation.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad end of the whole story came.
The killer of their car found a lazy jumper at the bottom of the Volhy River in the city of Čeboksary, Čuvašska.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police were able to identify a couple.
The documents survived a decade under water, without them the police would take much longer to find the identity of the found.
The couple was last sleeping when Žirnov rented a car from his father to get his girlfriend out of work.
The car that he discovered remains anonymous.
His findings were reported to the Chernobyl Police that the next day the car pulled up on the beach.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a cold journey around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be published after its completion.
The latest test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been undergone a new method of assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ ́ttsmedicinalverket) began to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to evaluate the applicants more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measures were taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failure to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases to the examination and the Forenz Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80% (2002) was assessed as an 18-year-old, while in another 25 cases, the Forenz Medical Agency found that the question is "possible 18-year-old".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the question is "possible under 18 years of age."
The tests shall be accessed only if the age of the questioned is controversial.
According to Johann GÃ¶ransson from the Forenz Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“In comparison with the previous month, statistics are held in railroads and numbers are very similar,” he said.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be older than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants lie at their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and noted that in 442 cases it was found that “the questioned person is 18 years of age or older”.
Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the questioned said he would be 18 years old this year.
A medical method for determining age, which includes X-ray teeth of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently evaluated by dentists and X-rayologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus from the Karolinska Institute, who is concerned, among other things, with the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty.
“I had a reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
Assessment of biological age is in some sense very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not preclude the opposite," Metro said.
The agency’s GÂransson forensic medical agency defended the decision: “Generally, it can be said that the risk of a child’s wrong assessment as an adult is small.
The highest risk represents the fact that the questioned person is just below the 18-year-old limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all questioned persons."
Trump threatened Mexican President by phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump in a January telephone call to Mexican President Enriquem Penny Nietzte threatened that he wouldn’t happen if he would publicly say his country wouldn’t pay for the construction of walls between the United States and Mexico.
In the interview, Trump said that funding would be arranged somehow, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is based on the reports published by the American newspaper The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of the walls on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
Immediately in the first interview with the Mexican President shortly after the arrival of Trump Money Nieta’s office, he did not diplomatically charge him for being critically committed to his wall-building plan.
Southern neighbours counted as a growing political problem and pushed on the Mexican president to publicly not say his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview, threatening the interruption of contact with the Mexican President if he would continue to issue an opposition statement.
The funding will be invented and will eventually work well.
“But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I don’t want to meet you, ladies, because it’s unacceptable for me,” Trump said.
The wall, at the same time, considers the least important thing we are talking about, but it may be politically the most important thing.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after the power was taken.
Mexico refuses building and financing walls of a length of 3,200 kilometers, and the relationships between the two countries have become stronger.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would still be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican opponent for the first time at the G20 in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported Trump's telephone interview with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The boss of the White House called the conversation ridiculous.
To this conclusion, it was forced to exchange opinions on an agreement that Australia will provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept persons from international facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump first considered the deal stupid, but later joined it.
“You can certainly say that this is not a deal you have created, but you will have to keep it,” Trump told Turnbull.
In some passages, the telephone interview with Turnbull was almost brutal, for example, when Trump considered a good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump shouted.
Suddenly, the tone of the interview was upset.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
“They won’t be great people going to work for local milkmen,” he said.
He also said that refugee could become a Boston killer in five years.
Trump led at the end of January, about a week after his arrival in the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world citizens, often even a few within one day.
The conversation with Turnbull was finally called the least pleasant for the whole day.
Before he ended, he said he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
The murderer of Rana was repaired before I gave him.
She also looked at her father.
It took place on a square in the capital of Yemen Sana.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose to be his victim to the little Rain Almatari, who lived in his neighbourhood.
Al Maghreb took the girl away and brought her to his father's house, where he raped her and wrapped her up with a dirty hand.
Then he raped her body, which he then swallowed near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl hit the whole country that faces a threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand-century ward that met to be a witness to the murder.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was sentenced under the law of Sharia.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after the murder.
I feel like being reborn.
I did it.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, together with Dave, shouting the word "Let justice live".
The rape officer brought the police truck from which he was pulled out.
Police put him on the stomach.
One of his members turned his arms and dropped the fire from the immediate nearby.
The present day celebrated every wound that was burned.
Mr. al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Injustice, Allah and Sharia's law have won," he added.
I stood at the Liberation Square in Sana and waited for the murder of my daughter.
Then I and my family went to the sea.
We took Ranino's small body and buried it at a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I, Jamileh, are grateful for the execution of justice.
The police feared that the dam collected on the square would fall into hateful madness, the killer would fall and crash.
It was ordered by a court that was under the control of the Shiite Hutians.
At first, however, Maghreb was sentenced to 100 wounds after being arrested, but his actions provoked such a contempt that the judge decided to punish the death penalty.
Al Maghreb was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Morning family knew him well.
When the police searched for his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more compassionate to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that carried the body of Ranin was terrible," he said.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we told the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, the posters with her picture were wearing everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes that the police have received a tip from killer parents who suspected their son for a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body was found.
Rana was going out to play with the other children from the neighbourhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where it was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and ride around, but we were looking for a lot.
Yemen’s residents were offended and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghreb was held, asking for immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the present record of the investigation to calm them.
He was accused of all his deeds.
Just before the punishment, the police read him the sentence, but the convicted was only flying to look at his executive.
The whole event was recorded for national television, but a lot of records were made on the internet.
Governor of West Virginia announces change of political party
The Democratic Governor of Western Virginia Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at President Trump's meeting that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, Democrats turned their backs to me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today, after a long prayer and thinking I announce to you... today as a resident of Western Virginia I say I can’t continue to support you from the position of a democratic governor.”
And the crowd of the watchers exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I will join Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has previously promised to people at a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice has inherited a large property from his father and is the owner of several carbs.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The movement of the Governor of Justice is another woe for a democratic party that will build barriers on our way rather than pleading for the rise of our country."
“For a democratic party, which has only 15 governors and controls at least legislative authorities in history, Justice Governor’s announcement is the last drop for such a conspiring party without a leader who is desperately striving to find positive and unifying reports,” said RNC President Ronna McDaniel.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "real" apology for the doping scandal
Former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that it has not yet been the right time to return Russia to the sports world.
Russian athlete chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress - which took place in the evening of MS athletics - that the removal of his country from the sport world was correct and that he was committed to fighting doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who came to this way for gold and silver medals.
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted for the conservation of the ban that came into force in November 2015 after the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
“I think we were witnesses of very honest answers and presentations today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleased to be surprised that Russia acknowledged its mistake and works in all its efforts to repair and restore the right function of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also “approved” that Russia adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has succeeded very well and we have moved to another level, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis state to preserve the penalty that has been rejected to Russia,” Coe added.
“In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from those unholy," he said.
The MS at the Athletics, which begins Friday in London, will compete under a neutral flag of 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict IAAF rules.
Rune Andersen, head of IAAF crisis, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is admitted back.
Tests on the presence of drugs are still inappropriate and the exclusion of the coaches continues to operate their activities, reporters in London said after the IAAF Council’s presentation was completed.
The CzechTrade state contract was acquired by Františka Savova, whose state is complaining.
The CzechTrade state-owned export agency received a public procurement from the Young Front Františka Savova.
Officials gave him 100 percent points in all quality criteria.
It did not happen to them that the Czech state claims Savova for tax fraud and demands its issue to the Czech Republic.
The CzechTrade pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a four-year public procurement for the provision of editing content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The order of a total of 30.8 million crowns was obtained by the Young Front of Entrepreneur Františka Savova.
In 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and accused him of escaping.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic asked for his release.
In the case, the server was warned by Aktually.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide on the price offered by 60 per cent and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, namely the quality of the project.
In fact, Savov’s company has helped the second criterion.
According to information, Dotyk.cz has received 100 points in all parts of the quality criteria.
It was just the result that she moved before the next candidate, the publisher Vltava Labe Media VLM, which at the same time offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with a amount of 404 900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the Young Fronts, however, the under-average assessment was obtained from evaluators in all quality criteria, a total of 62 points.
In addition, BDO Advisory and the digital R-Media agency participated as well as the server Aktualmente.cz under the issue of Economia.
VLM issued several objections against the result of the tendr with the fact that its assessment is considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their refusal, it was decided to attack the competition with the Authority for the Protection of the Competition.
It is believed that CzechTrade was in violation of the law.
"The contractor is convinced that the contractor has made a decision to choose a contractor on the basis of a subjective assessment, clearly favourable party of the Young Front, a.s., on the request of the contractor and other suppliers," writes in the proposal for the initiation of the proceedings submitted to the UOHS this week, which published the Aktu server.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of VLM Michala Climate, the score of the selection committee appears to be an incredible and 100 percent assessment of the Young Fronts project in all its members as exceptionally suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he said.
CzechTrade has not yet expressed the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not substantially comment on public procurement before concluding them.
All information about you mentioned contracts are in accordance with the law published in the Procurer Profile and in the Public Procurement Office.
"After completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we can't express it," said Stefan Dlouhý, a media representative for Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded with a statement that considers it extremely problematic that the publishing of Economia has been injured by an article at Aktualmente.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
This fact, however, was mentioned in the above article.
In the camp, it could help her to provide the BusinessInfo publishing services in the past four years.
The contract was first contested in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova blamed police from tax evasion in connection with its company’s excessive VAT deductions, causing the Czech state allegedly damage to up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has requested the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savova, the boss of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, whose influence is the Mafra publisher.
The London court rejected Savovo's appeal against issued last year, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"We haven't moved the case from yesterday, we haven't had any understanding in the matter of acquiring legal power from the UK until now," said Stephen Zenklov, spokesman of the Prague City Representative.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Fronts, Savov figured at Harvestor Limited, headquartered in Cyprus, controlled by the Czech Republic beer owner Samson, and at the Cyprus company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund purchasing threatened assets.
Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, should also be controlled by a shortened company, which owes more than three billion dollars.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the execution of assets from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorist walked through the hiking and park, ended up in the hills.
The motorcycle attracted attention to its unmatched ride on the streets, walking and parking roads in Úšović.
When the guard began to pursue him, she decided to go to the place of residence.
"Police men with increased caution were persecuted by the city when he failed to drive on one of the sideways behind the Marian Lazne and went into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
Finally, a rescue helicopter, who transported the injured motorcycle to the hospital, also had to fly.
After that, police found that the driver had not owned a driver's driver's license, the motorcycle registration marks were cut off, his production number was cut off and the production label itself was removed.
It is so possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breathing test was excluded from the presence of alcohol on-site in the driver, but the test found a positive result on metamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neymara to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not inhibit Neymar’s record transition from Spain to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which monitors European soccer teams and has the power to ban teams to participate in the prestigious Champions League.
Financial fair play (FFP) rules, which introduced UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s transition was not financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid €222 million to buy Neymar from its contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions that Neymar's departure into France.
Because the PSG team is financed by a rich Qatari family that has enriched energy sales, it can allow Neymara to be brought into such a star soccer family.
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but on the other hand they must demonstrate legal revenue resources, allowing them to cover the governing costs of football-related trade activities.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the UEFA Chair in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs debtors in hunting for new reinforcements would eventually be deceived and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide it.
In 2011, FFP redirected its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing cash for players to build a global brand - was not so convenient at once.
Within the current three-year testing period ending in 2018, clubs can demonstrate a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander Čeferin is committed to defending the ban on excessive expenses.
"FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," said Andrea Traverso to Associated Press, who monitors compliance with FFP rules last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a single payment, it may displace the amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be charged to EUR 44.4 million a year for five years.
The first wave of the highest sanctions of the FFP hit the PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG paid a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League's team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
The UEFA is watching teams that can try to avoid financial regulators by increasing their income through club-owned companies.
Therefore, although the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the deduction of the amount.
UEFA joined the same measure in 2014 after deciding that the amount of the funds provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Some reports say that some of the Neymar revenue in the PSG could be charged by the MS’s 2022 Football Organization Commission in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of the MS 2022 in Qatar have rejected the fate that Neymat should become the ambassador of the MS in football and that such a manure would be easily revealed by UEFY agents.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG indicate that UEFA will carefully monitor any attempt to overcome the rules,
According to Tuesday, the UEFA devoted persons did not initiate any investigation into the Neymara transfer in the PSG case.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was unlawful to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press said.
The latest published accounting conclusions show that PSG closed the year 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of decors.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent.
Representatives of the Spanish league, apparently worried about the departure of one of the largest stars, strived to destroy Neymar’s departure, arguing that the PSG violated the FFP rules.
“It’s a clear case of the club’s ‘financial doping’ and the state,” said the president of the Liga Javier Teba for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the PSG club’s ownership as a Qatari union.
The manager of Arsenal Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares the same position of La Liga on the club’s financing.
“This is the result of ownership that has changed the world of football in the last 15 years from the beginning,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as the club’s owner becomes, everything is possible.
The financial fair play rules are very difficult because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.”
Spartan Warehouse Russian: Changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand applause fans on their legs.
Tom Russky goes to the square.
The same scene as in the Sunday race against Bohemians.
The Spartan warrior moved against the Red Star game, invented several goals, but his co-players did not mix into black.
The new multi-million-powered airline team ends after the introduction of two-ways in the European Cups.
Was it difficult for the game to do something else after Belgrade?
Four shots were needed after the invased goal, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, raise our self-confidence, so that we could turn away from what to further matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why didn't Sparta get to the match so long?
The game is very elaborate.
The combination of the competitors was much better than ours.
We haven't done anything, we've probably shot once in half a time.
Of course, it’s very little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you need to press the rivals more often in such positions.
Is there a big number of changes in the building?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is created.
We played only three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It’s about the coach to find the perfect one that sits.
Is it an encouragement for you to have played a part of two matches?
It's still just part of the race.
I don’t know how my condition will evolve and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that happened in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it can't be.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta decided somehow, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in a large number, but they left in disappointment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, as well as with God.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
I'm going to tell you something they're going to come next time.
We can thank them for coming here.
I don't remember that visit when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we fight ourselves, we play each other, so it’s not such a benefit for us.
After the extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur has to leave for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is expected to dismiss in prison for ten years for the infringement of taxes.
The calculated damage amounts to 645 million krones.
Toman in the complaint argued that justice had violated its fundamental rights and that the findings of the courts in Zlína and Olomouci were incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges identified the complaint as unintentional, the TTC found out in the database of the court.
US is not another appeal court.
"As a fourth instance, it cannot judge the facts or legal doubts allegedly imposed by the general courts unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," he said.
Toman was sentenced as a refugee.
Verdikt has been authorised since November 2015 when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouca.
At that time, Toman was in a release arrest in Argentina, where he was found at the time of decision-making of the U.S.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the statute, corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court has identified the case as an extreme tax evasion that has only a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as President of the World Servis Board of Directors between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only during the period from January to July 2008, according to the expert, the total escape exceeded a billion.
However, for proceedings, Toman could no longer be judged for the entire amount.
According to the allegation, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax recognition.
Instead of monthly VAT and Consumer Tax withdrawals in order of at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just thousands.
World Service and some companies with which the company traded have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomir Selectal, whom justice measured for VAT machination in trailers for 13 years of prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer for Insurvival" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both famous characters from the 1980s; for the dirty 90s (when genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy scanner "The State"); and, of course, for modern times, particularly 2001, bigger than stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul to project.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parodie, and at the same time incorporating our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the French point of view, it seems that someone is breathing.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, it can be a story about the formation of a speaker flavour with vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main funny points - the middle-aged actors who play teenager-trapped children - and so couldn't get rid of previous events.
The continuation of “Ten Years Later” in which adults play so unpreparedly at emotional level and satira is spots to sporadical, including the 90s thriller parodie as “Hand on the Collapse”.
At one point, the character finds the Apple Powerbook’s haraburn, wheel brush, and “the back of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The charitable Coop (Mr. Showalter), a writer now, still hasn't moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panic.
It is not about a crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), which is encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of French are many side stories.
It is particularly fun to watch the eternal young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the Youth movie, whose formerly respectable character of Andy is now an old paprika.
The French could start moments of random crazyness, such as reversing the Seven Up series, until it reaches what I suppose is a logical remark: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group is released on the final stage for "The Summer of Survival".
In the meantime, Comrade Detective on Amazon calls for another type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series "So normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: Without regret" and even the "GLOW" series, in which the icons of the eastern and western wrestling scenes are confronted.
The comedy of Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomas's directors is to act as a television inscension: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s, fighting for the truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Iosefa are Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelio Ulici, who have awarded the English language Channing Tatum (exigent producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it’s not much more.
In some jokes, you are laughing (such as police watching shakes on TV - parodie for American football).
The series was loaned by many famous actors including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
“Comrade Detective” is too focused on the propaganda drama – which includes a killer with the mask of Reagan – and, accordingly, it looks like that.
Six long episodes are too exciting and comedy moments are not enough.
At a shorter tracking, the propagandistic satira in Comrade Detective could work, for example, on the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in which two thickeners screw hamburgers on large crowds.
A clear message for imaginary communist obedience is the fact that western culture can transform everything into a rainbow and an orgy.
The thoughts of the Romanian creators were not wrong: we do both with our own culture as well as with them.
Russian athletes did not wait for the cancellation of the ban on startups from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation of IAAF confirmed the prolongation of the international ban on Russian racing starts due to the state-supported doping program.
Voting in the history of the world championship, which begins on Friday, occurred very clearly as expected.
The prolongation of the ban was expressed by 166 delegates, with only 21 votes against it.
The main reason for refusing is the fact that Russia is not able to meet all requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, Rune Andersen, Chief of the IAAF Special Investigation Group before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continues.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, many suspect athletes have not been interviewed yet, and coaches are still working in the country with dishonest reputation.
The Russian antidoping agency RUSADA has not yet been fully functional, which does not meet the standards of the World Antidoping Agency.
However, RUSADA can now conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and British antidoping agencies.
“Even if progress has taken place, there is still a lot of work to do,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athlete federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes came to the last Olympics in Riu de Janeiro.
Despite the prohibition of the upcoming MS, 19 Russians who have previously proved to have been tested out of the Russian anti-doping system for a longer time.
But they will not be able to start at the championship in national colors and they will not play Russian hymn in case of victory.
The Bank of England will support the interest rate of 0.25 %
The Bank of England should, according to the expectation, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a significant economic growth and weakening of inflation, which has led to speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will continue to be "in the background" in connection with the maintenance of interest rates - despite the demands of family budgets.
The Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two in order to maintain interest rates of 0.25 %. The results of the vote for the increase of interest rates supported unprecedented economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual report on inflation, the bank predicted a growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the reduction in family budgets will continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank pointed out that growth should occur in the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit and also indicated that leasing from the mobility would grow more on the financial markets than expected.
The committee’s members also voted in favour of the withdrawal of a part of the mammalian package, whose task was to support the economy, which was introduced in practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, a deadline funding plan should start to pay from February following which will offer cheap grants to banks, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term with a pressure on real income for households and consumer burden.”
On the issue of the rate, the bank said it would be necessary to “treat the risks of monetary policy” to calm down inflation, “at a higher level” than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict the first growth in the third quarter of the next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “free” and “restricted”.
The Bank reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year by 1.9% and 1.7% foreseen in May.
The expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound declined from 0.5% to $1.31 and from 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing increase buried hope for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3 % in the second quarter compared to 0.2 % in the previous three months.
Increase is likely to remain at 0.3 % in the third quarter, although at the end of the year, according to the bank’s statement, should be slightly increased.
The latest report on inflation is an unprecedented comfort for households affected by increasing inflation and low wages. The Bank noted that the situation is even worse before the rise.
The report further states that monetary policy will “not prevent” revenue reduction in the coming years, but it is expected that wages will “significantly” rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the great interest in British goods due to the low pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0.025 % last year in response to a shocking EU referendum, resulting in a drop in pounds.
The Bank estimates that the total unification of prices and economics will take at least four years.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with increasing inflation, which developed increasing pressure on households. Three politicians demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Last month, inflation declined to 2.6 percent of June 2.9 percent, although the bank stated that such a change was expected and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank noted that the surplus of the target relative to 2% was “fully” as a result of a weak library.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “In view of the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that the competition in the mortgage market will only rise as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a good look at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up existing contracts and re-income mortgages - there are options free of charge, as well as low rates that they prefer."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV medication for 10,000 patients
Patients receive access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention from September on the basis of the Supreme Court’s decision on NHS funding.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP), which is used before sex, reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within three years of testing.
NSH agreed to finance the test period after the appeal court supported last year’s Supreme Court’s decision, saying that NHS has funds to pay the PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, took NHS England from the mouth of Director-General Simon Stevens as a "significant intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to receive patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among threatened patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific medications in the body of the patient to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and HIV-positive people who fail to treat successfully.
Clinics will designate eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at the GP in the UK may also sign up in their local sexual health clinic and be involved in the testing.
The program will come taxpayers of £10 million and NHS England signed this week a drug distribution contract after obtaining international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation in a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully endeavour to constantly expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It’s another milestone in more than thirty years’ attempts to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of the NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnesses of a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients in danger, it will offer the possibility of changing the English epidemic of HIV.
NSH will offer patients exposed to high risk of HIV a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to negotiate a partner, leading to improving the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement with pleasure."
Ian Green, Executive Director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be the rapid testing across the country; we must ensure its availability for every patient.
Now we have the PrEP test medication available and we are on a good way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, Sharon Hodgson, said: “The beginning of the PrEP testing period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us a step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the PREP.
Now it is important that we start tests as soon as possible across the country and protect people who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.
Life on high legs: the peak and smart design have transformed this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate passionate banker, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne’s smart terrace - and is a visual illustration of modern design, which uses the maximum available space.
“I lived with my ex-wife in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I’ve been looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I hit this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and on that same day, I fell in love with him.”
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters has been fully renovated.
One-room apartment with complicated design - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add deterrent spaces and the intermittent to take advantage of a high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, large windows and lots of lights.
That was my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, headquartered in Notting Hill, employed nearly a four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights so that two ladders could climb over themselves - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which it could walk straight.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is completely complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk straight.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but also to roll the steel structure at the same time so that it is in the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to build two full-time rooms on each other - and at the same time add dramatically.
On the main floor, the beautiful living room looks at the old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
The mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramatic, space and lighting.
The short walk is covered with mirrors on both sides and looks so long.
The mirror sheet in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the entrance doors there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storage of equipment and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which offers the whole apartment an impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Composite kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique to this solution, however, is a foolish door.
“We had to resolve the technical side,” Erfan said about detected dipped doors.
“The door is equipped with anti-weights so that it is very easy.”
Thanks to the smart use of the space and storage spaces, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, the second room and a better overall design of the apartment.
"When it comes to you, so what you sell is the living area - or the award of your property," Erfan said.
"A real broker in essence when entering the apartment calculates its price based on the residential area."
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that lend a space of luxury appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional path with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love the separation of electricity in the walls.
Yes, they’re important, but your hearts don’t get it.”
As it has been shown, quality design and elevation of the living room can turn the ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is relaxing.
The cultural and political breakthrough between the blue and red states is deepened.
California has declared a ban on travelling its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The Tennessee State paid it to her and declared a lawful ban on travelling her citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in full sense, but citizens of the United States can travel freely across all 50 countries.
It is the fact that California has banned state money to spend on the roads of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this crazy thing?
California is strong for LGBT and any manifestation of disagreement with LGBT lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on consciousness that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT therapy does not have the duty to provide them with it, but has the duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again adopted laws that religious charity organizations that have given children from mothers after birth to adoption do not have the obligation to provide these children for adoption to homosexual couples.
Due to these laws on consciousness, California has banned the financing of its citizens’ journeys to eight EU states from its funds.
In practice, this means that California professors should not have the roads to scientific symposium in Texas, for example, paid by their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with financial support of their schools.
On the road they have to get either federal grants, but it’s absurd that the federal government finances the roads of citizens from the state A to the state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has been patient and its parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it also does not like California’s high tax policy, high state expenditure, high deficits and illegal immigrants’ tolerance, but it does not rule over California because of this.
It rules it as a lead for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to each state of the Union which would order a travel ban for any reason for another state.
At the same time, he called on Parliaments of all countries to stop this crazyness.
That's the fact, now a comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing is anti-constitutional.
States are entitled to adopt laws on their conscience, as well as to decide on what their money should go or what they should not do.
Second, what's wrong with consciousness?
If a cutter has a religious problem to sell pigs, why shouldn’t he offer only cattle, sheep, poultry and fish?
Why do you force him to sell pigs under penalty, when the cutters offer pigs are enough?
In the state of Colorado, a pector faces anti-discrimination complaints and high penalties because he refused to give up a cake for a homosexual wedding.
It also refuses to drink cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and leave him in the room and don't order the corresponding cakes with hundreds of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the Federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policies in non-federal powers, according to their own preferences.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California as well.
Fourth, LGBT community members once legitimately strived for tolerance to their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rules of life and let them live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not to be tolerated, but to be tolerated by extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one should ever express a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with LGBT lifestyle, and if they do so, it should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the newest enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know the situation in U.S. history when states have agreed to do so because of political issues, except for one case.
Even in the time of the civil rights struggle of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the States did not impose sanctions on themselves.
This was the only case in the 1950s, the 19th century, and the political caution was slavery and went to the North War against the South.
Of course, there is no such thing now, but the situation is toxic.
The cultural and political breakthrough between the blue-democratic and the red-republican states deepens, and the United States mentally disintegrates internally.
Unwanted agitation.
Putin's critics have received a fatty penalty.
Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalnyj received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violation of the campaign rules before the presidential elections next year.
The court punished him for calling for people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to take the position of head of state in March.
The Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidate, but in general he is expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him in the morning and brought him to court.
He was punished for calling people to demonstrate through videos on YouTube’s internet portal.
The penalty is three hundred thousand.
"Later, we'll pull them out of the wage of the judge," he cried on the Kremlin critics on Twitter.
The Russian election committee recently concluded that Navalnyj could not participate in presidential elections because he was previously sentenced to convictions.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
The penalties of 300 thousand rubles, the amount of 25 thousand rubles on Thursday, also imposed the court on two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalnyj entered Russia’s politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant person on the scattered opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Navalne in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year-old conditional punishment for stealing forest company Kirovles.
In May, the Court of Appeal confirmed the dictatorship.
The judgment is so powerful that it prevents Navalne from applying under Russian laws.
Brothers Fight for an Empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire with their Italian family, override one of the most expensive Victorian property worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides in the kingdom of Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has reached a dispute about common property and business assets to the highest court.
Paul wanted to leave his family business in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly broken down in front of the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store bought a family at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
This place was founded by the Westco Jeans family, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company in a recalculation of $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, building lands in Brunswick and Sorrenta, apartments on Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers on the premises.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is a "significant impulse force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Colin has a real estate worth $316 million, while Paul manages a real estate for $176 million.
For Paul, it was a problem for the distribution of assets and funds.
“Colin’s proposal was significantly in favour of him in my eyes,” Paul wrote in a deputy statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business – from which Paul cut off Colin’s statement.
Colin opposes that it is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement with certain properties.
In the previous deputy statement, Colin said he believed in the apparent solution to the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of sites of post-prejudiced statements, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers, including Allan Myerse, QC and defenders of both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and bottles since the 1950s and bought a district in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For the money acquired by stopping the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with the jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in the last year of high school, Paul was still a young, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigim, who died in 2012, they had hoped that the transfer of property to children would take place for good.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end in court," she wrote.
Another two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family company group. Colin said Mark was compensated for $10 million and Luke was compensated for $26 million when he left.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been back since then, despite the fact that he has been a former member of the AFL club's leadership, as he stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and best friend of Colin.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only responded through a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is resolved before the court, “I have nothing to add to.”
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in one of the statements at the court that he tried to adapt to his brother's requirements.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he said, and added that he is constantly hoping for a clear solution.
On Friday, all hopes were invisible.
“Our disputes will be resolved soon,” Colin wrote.
Were in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers have water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci School of Motherhood in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction, and the trees that have been planted do not give a large shade yet.
There is no swimming pool there, but teachers shower in the kitchen.
In the afternoon, children stay in classes where stomachs are downloaded and attached belts.
The air is trying to cool the cleaner air because the air conditioning does not have.
It’s also important for teachers and cookers.
“The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygiene limits for maternal schools, so in this period we should not even have an open operation,” said Miloslav Makovikovičkova, director of school.
In the school there is a glass corridor where the temperature moves about 40 degrees.
We will ventilate in the morning at 6:00 p.m., the windows will be closed, and we have the southern sides of the gastronomy with which we protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions have a forest school in Hostices, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful solvent there, a table under it, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompan, director of school.
Teachers are trying to go to the forest with their children, where there is a larger bowl.
The children have wet headquarters and have different water games on the program.
"We have a hand pressure sprayer that is used for flower sprays, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
The director of maternal school in Novoborska Street at Prague Prosecu, Jitka Vilimovska, also said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and drop them in water.
"We have a fairly growing garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
It goes out in the morning and then until 5 p.m.
Every child must have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little salty tea or diluted juice and have a beer with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad and always fresh fruits and vegetables that parents sometimes bring to them.
"Maybe today a mother brought about ten pounds of melon for children," Makovičkova added.
The drivers receive water or summer steering.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them in hot days with water, ion beverages or summer seasons.
The tram drivers’ cabins and buses are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger space.
High-temperature trams have not seriously damaged yet.
The small damage occurred in the hostility.
At current high temperatures, we mainly pay attention to the drivers to have sufficient drinks available.
"Refrigerated drinking water is available in all pins, exchange points and tickets," said Řehková.
In tickets and in some exchange locations, employees have the so-called sabotages that produce a refrigerated sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion beverages.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily exchanges," the spokesman added.
Hot and dry weather in the last days results in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, 108 hackers were eliminated throughout the Czech Republic, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday after the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, the rabbits were employed mainly fighting the fire.
"They prefer fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with wildworks," spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
It didn’t even bring any evening weather change when storms and flood precipitations changed warmly in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, the hammers went to 236 interventions.
It was especially about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"The most attacked in the Middle East," Zaoral continues.
But there was also a need for help in Stvolínkás in Czechoslovakia, where 60 people were evacuated safely from the children’s camp because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also worked for Prague rescue officers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, sanitation went out to ten cases of carbohydrate poisoning.
Therefore, people should keep their water heaters checking, rescue officers warn.
Carbon oxide is a colorless gas without smell, which is released when imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling depressed.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, you should leave the frozen room.
Trump’s new state chief plans to restrict President’s media diet
Many have tried it before him and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new head of state in the White House plans to restrict President Trump’s flow of information, including reporting in television news, in the hope of keeping Trump at the level.
Here is a part of the report by reporter Josh Dawseye:
“When new head of the White House chairman John F. Kelly met on the first day in a new job with employees, Trump’s key problem, which he intends to fix, is the wrong information that the president receives in his hands.
Kelly told employees that they must personally approve all information - whether on paper or in speech - because the president can make a better decision on the basis of the right information."
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors washed their teeth to control Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's media relationship dates a few decades ago - and now that he is sitting in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
"If Trump was excited as a candidate by honorary reports, it was appropriate to show him that he was talking about a lot of other media in a positive light, which was easier to convince," said Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal at that time wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on the ground – at least according to the words of his campaign’s six former organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praise him.”
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was once “under control,” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something other people don’t know about – that Trump’s tweets would be more stimulating if someone didn’t control them.
The tweets that Trump has never sent will probably never get to know.
If his employees managed to hold him at least a few times on the ground, their effort wouldn't be denied.
However, no one has been able to prevent Trump regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which is composed of competing fractions, people are trying to regularly reinforce their agenda by putting Trump’s materials — which can, but may not be reliable — that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published in May a report on the tendency of advisers to submit doubtful information to the head of the state.
Here’s an example of this information from Shane Goldmacher’s pearl reporter:
“The current and former Trump officials say that the president often reacts very angry to negative reports from the media, especially then to reports on the evacuation of information, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone submits to the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of Charles C. Johnson's provocator - who accused the chief executive of the state, Katie Walsh, of being "a source of many information escapes" from the White House.
No matter that Johnson has been rejected from Twitter forever for complaint; or that he has not submitted his claim any evidence; or that he has already published false accusations in the past and later revoked them.
Trump read the article and began asking Walsh.
Goldmacher added that former head of state Reince Priebus and White House secretary Rob Porter “are trying to implement the system to manage and document the information President Trump will receive.”
Fungovalo by it?
Kelly is now trying to use the same strategy three months later.
It may seem to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impunity will not be lost and his assistants will still compete for power.
These unchangeable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly be difficult.
Tourists negotiate about the arrival and return to the Millionaire Quarter
Several of the most influential owners of homes in the English West Midland county will again go over with the dedicated tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to reacquiring the field behind their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field at the flourishing streets in Solihull, which is called the “millionary neighborhood”.
They brought horses, children, and the army of caravans, tourists returned after they had been deported in May, and they did not even see a crash that was deported on the ground under the regulations of the authorities to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found lakes in the defense and penetrated into the field with the caravans unprotected lakes that served on the road.
The refugee residents of the neighborhood attacked Solihull City’s Board of Directors with the fact that ‘not able to solve the problem’.
One of the people who wanted to stay anonymously said: “They had this place on Monday night after they moved on Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones after other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists moved to another place and now they're back.
“Yesterday there were others, and I guess there will be more today.”
She added: ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to impose this problem. To protect the parks, court orders are used.
I live on Streetsbrook and don’t hesitate to pay taxes until the board of directors has arranged for tourists.”
Another of the anonymous people said: ‘It’s funny. We’ve recently watched the last departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time they have more and this time they have brought horses with them.”
The press spokesman of Solihull said: “We are aware of the unlawful stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with local police we take the necessary legal steps to resolve the entire problem.
In order to collect as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many local people as possible announce any non-community or illegal behaviour of the police on number 101.
We will get a total picture that we will present to the court."
The wife of the European Ambassador hit a car in Brussels.
It was brought by a government special.
The government's specialty transported the injured Robert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
At the airport there were two sanitizens, and the aircraft was under constant control of Slovenian doctors.
A long planned flight has gone without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský, according to TV JOJ, had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He said the car hit him and since then he's in a serious state.
After transport to the country, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
Economic analyst is the wife of the Slovak European Ambassador Jany Žitňansky by NOVA.
She didn't want to express herself to the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians confirm in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGOs arriving on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
“If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they can continue their operations,” said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
The last warning came a day after the Italian authorities dismissed the German rescue ship of Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking in people, which significantly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates in the first year, refused to comment on the whole matter due to the accusation by the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartosiose.
“For us it is and will always be a priority for human lives, so we are very sorry that we can’t operate in rescue zones at the moment,” the organization said in a social media statement.
“We can only comment on all momentum charges after collecting all information and evaluating the entire situation.”
Italian authorities have monitored the boat of Iuventa organization Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants to the ship, which were transferred directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's record.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and surrounded by the Italian coastal guard who is supervising rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board the vessels, such as Iuventa for monitoring activities.
Only three out of nine non-governmental non-profits participating in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last appointed organization on Thursday stated that new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any “essential change or obstacle” in the case of rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of a new Code of Conduct has also been rejected by the MSF, which is the Nobel Prize holder.
In the meantime, it was told that a sharp decline in immigrants in recent weeks, which have emerged in Italy in the context of rescue operations, indicates that the efforts to strengthen the coastal guards and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
“In the last days we begin to watch the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations to take place this month with the Mayor of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Nigeria and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hope of reaching Europe.
Unshamed Mesarošová: With overall, its silicone and cellulite fell!
Hot summer days are completely attracted to take on just the most necessary, which covers the most intimate parts.
Just Dominica Mesarosh does it on the contrary.
At a afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers, and all that has to do with TV Prima, just a shelter, his body was invaded into a mini-oeral.
And just a few regular movements were enough, and the model showed everyone its silicone, but also a task.

Michelle Carter is condemned for sending text messages that encourage suicide of Conrad Roye
The woman from Massachusets was sentenced to withdrawal for more than two years for encouragement to her friend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter leaves for 15 months of a two-year punishment on the net and then spends five years on conditional release.
Carter was sentenced in June for the unintentional murder of Conrad Roye who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is destroyed.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until the decision.
It threatened her for up to 20 years of freedom, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Carter, dressed in red pants and cream blouse, was standing on the spot when she exposed the judgment with tears in the eyes, with shedding hands and eyes toward the ground.
"She's been killed by Conrad Roye," the prosecutor said.
“He finished his life so that he could take care of himself.
She couldn’t take her own responsibility,” she said.
“I didn’t show any comments.”
However, Carter’s lawyer said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of maturity or even mental disorders have no significant impact on their performance.”
The complainant read Roy's mother Lynn Roy's statement: "It's not going to take a single day to get my son lost.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the extraordinary pain we will bear with us forever."
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy proved that she was "traced" by consciousness that she would never take part in her brother's wedding and would never be a grandmother of his children.
“The loss of a man with whom I have seen since my birth is the pain I have taken to life,” she said.
The State of Massachusetts has no applicable law that would affect a person assisting the suicide of another person, thus establishing a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 on a car seat poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter’s text messages were published, which encouraged suicide.
“I don’t care if you both jump out of the building, jump out of the building, or get out of it,” Carter wrote in text messages just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before his suicide, he wrote to him: “You have to do that, Conrade” and “Stop just hitting the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered any comments in the press to remain.
The case raised many questions.
Amanda Knox, one of the people who were built on Carter’s side, was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death for the murder of her British co-habitant in Italy in 2007.
Mrs. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in an acute response
Just a day before Audi announcement, BMW car manufacturer said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s seat – which considers the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision to be downloaded.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to comply with carbon emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide that releases diesel engines is considered carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the costs of vehicle installations are increased to neutralize diesel engines’ gases, thus reducing the competitiveness of vehicles.
While German car manufacturers are facing careful checks, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of distorting powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s errors, which have installed software in their vehicles in order to fulfil emission limits, which has reduced emissions while testing, but has been deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials were charged in the United States and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former driver of thermodynamics of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nationality and therefore does not apply to it, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi took part in the German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen cars after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that had to surround the European emissions limits – thus expanding the accusations Audi faced in the United States.
Inclusion of the Audi car in the investigation can have an immediate impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturers constitute a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landing on the beach.
The man and the girl died.
The accident occurred at Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses of the TV channel SIC Noticias said that the plane was flying just over the people on the beach before the landing.
Some people from the beach were claimed to flee from the danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape in front of the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
"The plane hit and they were dead on site," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom were arrested alive from the accident and the police took them to the hearing.
D11 or how to stop the roads.
Are the roads in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a look.
It is unfair even though it started to be built in 1978.
Although it is unfair, it is constantly fixed.
And it should not be built anymore, even if it has construction permits.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 road.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months has stopped the movement of the Children of the Earth.
We eastwards get a trail for pieces, as when they walk in salad.
They hide the wheel and then only see when and if we get another.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and want to get trucks to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite trucks flow directly through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonably object.
However, the last corner of our highway was carried out in 2008, i.e. nine years ago.
Since then, no, no, no, no.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of an unfinished section to the Cradci Král and other sections to Jaromedri began an archaeological survey with the fact that the construction began at the end of this year, you could hear in the eastern Czechs the voice of screws.
No one believes that anymore.
Last week it turned out that it wouldn’t be built this year.
And maybe next year.
The Children’s Country Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has been dismissed.
The children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They have taken construction permit decisions throughout the scope.
They shall request a review of all the already issued binding opinions of all relevant authorities.
For example, the Graduate Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, and also the Ministry of Defense or the Road Office.
So far, we are from D11 near the village with the exceptional name Pohřebačka.
Then we sit down, just go on the road, and suddenly we stand on the sideway, and give preference to join in the colony.
The worst is that you see similar stories throughout the Republic.
The busy, constantly cheap road to Benešov, D1 or D8.
Everybody has his own funeral.
What do the children of the earth require?
What is the essence of the construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
Why is the road network virtually incomplete in the current system?

Levandule from Provence threatens climate change
Levandule became a symbol of the Provence in the southeastern region of France, but they are now threatened by climate change.
Levanduli is derived from a drought and harmful poison, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of levandues in Provence is threatened because in recent years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the levandula.
They also have their fault with the micro-bacterial streaming cycades and cows, which can be done in the dry climate.”
There's a lot in the bet.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil, which is made from them, is an important component of perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavandons is of course smaller."
A possible solution can be the more efficient distribution of water and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also the floating of levandues with the protective mixture of food and water and the melting of several resistant species to dry weather.
Journalist murder emphasizes growing threats in Mexico
Workers of the Riodoce week regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss news about the concerns that are taking place in Sinaloa for the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and non-governmental drug wars.
Today, however, it is under pressure of recent events mainly because of its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: bringing their children to the office that someone attacked in 2009 with a granate or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to specify their names to every word - there is no need for evidence, just use imagination and predecessor.
Choosing them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover criminal acts.
Violence continues and the bodies are crushed across the country; journalists are constantly increasing: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been in power since President Enrique Pen Niet arrived in December 2012; 589 of them are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them have been in all state.
Among them, the co-founder of Riodioce magazine, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence, drug trafficking.
His loss is clear, although his presence is universal - Valdeze's large photograph with the title "Justity", on which the mediator shows, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with the photo of Valdeze's smile on the back of the moon.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about reciprocal traumas, nightcloths, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, two suspects have been charged, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime.
Reporters from Riodoca insist that they will inform the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; although the destruction is a complaint and the territory is currently very betrayable.
Without information about the injuries and without the vision of justice, the meeting on security is unnecessary, Ibarra says.
“It’s hard to spend time on such meetings,” he added.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce centre in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He was able to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him by 12 shots, according to all the name of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
Then the shooters went into his car and took him away from the place of crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two adult children.
The news appears to spread rapidly in Culiacan.
However, in the case of Valdes, there is only a suspicious silence.
Since the last detention of Guzmán and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest fighters in the country as the rival fraction seeks to fill an empty place.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the funerals are full of exquisite two-story mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than homes.
Forget for a moment that the word "direct" is thought that one drug cardle controls the coastal state with expensive ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America.
Despite the fact that Valdez was confidentially familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60 years), co-founder and director of Riodoce, is still obstructing that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that his death has contributed to two doubts.
The first February interview was Damasco Lopez, the leader of one of the competing drug cards that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
Peace could break down the sons; suspicious members of the gang shot all of the copies of the newspaper at the time they landed on the tables.
The second mistake was not to force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after the release of other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is considered an important militant in the fight against journalists.
He was able to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the Noroeste magazine, he was virtually veteran when he decided in 2003 to sell his shares of $50 and establish with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloe, “it was impossible to operate a journalist and not to mention drug trafficking,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce gained a good reputation over time for the courageous and true news; the newspapers began to publish.
Journalists enjoyed searching for problems and published texts without censorship - readers fascinated reading stories that nobody else had dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Committee’s award for his courageous reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said when he received the prize.
Drug trade in Sinaloae is a “lifestyle,” Valdez said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what’s going on?’
The employees of Riodoce were married after Valdez. The man was known for his joking and unselect language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and collection - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all rely on their daily routine.
He's always wearing his chest.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar in front of his offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their work as best as possible and survive?
"You don't like them when you wear with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing surfaces."
“These things were prohibited,” Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censure and self-conservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something isn't playing here, get your hands away.
The problem is that, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, “which is the sense that can be shaken... and then that happened to Javier.”
The old rules according to him, like others, are no longer applicable in Sinaloae - just as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of luxurious rabbit pathways, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees are sitting, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, spyware was discovered that governments purchased to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief in front of a 40-degree hide in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were elected by the state to protect the Riodoce office, located in a four-story building in the municipal district of Culiacan.
Journalists are aware of whether these police officers are not part of 50 percent of the defenders of the law who are corrupt, according to the government.
It’s been a few months ago that journalists have last issued in the upper areas that are basically controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first of them is the murder of the former boxer Julio César Chaveze in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to the suspicious government expenditure carried out in the hometown of the Governor of the State.
Recently, several kidnappings occurred in one of the most luxurious restaurants of Culiacán, just a block from the Office of the State Prosecutor.
No one officially announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were watching when they were about to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is the favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a certain policy associated with a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of political scenes almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high positions.
Villarreal asked the journalist to write about earlier incidents in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán escaped the military intervention unit.
Even a month ago, readers would read this topic in the Valdez header, which was the best source of information about the kidnapping.
"Valdez would certainly relax the case," said Villarreal (46), which is renamed "El Flaco" for his narrow character.
“Now, all the newsmen have turned their backs to us.”
Valdez's office has turned into a warehouse of cedules and ankles to protest against journalists' murders, and employees have certainly not expected them to become activists in the press representation.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez hit a couple of crashes and released the next morning to demonstrate before the Office of the State Prosecutor for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdes' murder in the western part of Michoacán state.
The authorities claim that Adame's DNA analysis is based on the DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and climb on pedestrians and SOS print buildings.
The head of the newspaper Bojorquez is the day of his visit to Washington, where he seeks to obtain international support and achieve justice for Valdes’ death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, which took place the day after the murder of Valdes, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and their murders for proclaimed the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of fear that her anger could threaten her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “convicted” of organized crime, corrupt officials, and the illicit public.
In his latest book Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by ordering politicians and security forces that cooperate with the organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
“You die in Mexico because they want to quiet you,” Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macias, who took place six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message that allegedly signed cardinal Zetas: "This is how I ended for my messages."
Beside the heads pulled, the keyboard and headphones were laid.
Some branches decided to end their activities, such as El Norte newspaper headquartered at the northern borders of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslav Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the killing of his director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly entitled the drug cardinal on the home page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists escaped from their homes or even across the border.
It's an easy decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
Journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruze.
For those who decide to stay and do not give up their work, it poses a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist,” he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce's employees sit on the hill front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when it suddenly begins to call the phone.
It is reported that 19 people died in a shooting between gang members and police near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is graduated, just as many messages left in this area by the members of the union were promised.
Journalists publish this newspaper from their mobile phone on the Riodoca website.
There will be no day and the title will change again.
The sounds of the Syrian police indicate the next shot.
Bojorquez puts an eye-catching view of the police guard to make sure they are watching.
If they’re afraid, they don’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the collapsed co-founder of their journal - whose intermediary is an exceptional slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoca employees follow his steps.
“How could we just think of leaving,” Bojorquez said, “when the same day I was killed by Javier, one internist asked me to send her to the streets?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a soca, no matter how scary it is.
The researchers have now revealed the findings of the first findings of the amazing creature about the size of a nozzle, whose perfectly preserved residues - which experts called 'Mona Lisa Dinosaurs' - found the Canadian hill.
The remains were kept so high that experts were able to determine the color of his shaved skin in red and brown and stated that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in Current Biology said it was “the most conservative of the so-called reverse dinosaur and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
Zkamenellelina is a new species of Nodosauridae tribe. Dinosaur lived in the period of the Creed, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved state was literally shocked by researchers who described it with the words ‘remarkable’.
According to National Geographic, a white-white is still the best preserved stoneline of its species.
Shawn Funk was found to be a rocky man, who revealed the rock on March 21, 2011 when he was swallowing down Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberta.
He hit something that looked like a stranger object and decided to explore it closer.
The stoneline was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
"You're a little bit stuck up your eyes and believe you sleep," said Caleb Brown's head of work and a physician at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the animal is exposed.
"It's definitely recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and grown-up dinosaurs species - Mona Lisa dinosaurs."
According to his skin study, researchers found that this bullshit - although he was covered with guns and reminded the walking tank - was highly likely to face a serious threat by mass dinoscopes.
Heavily reversed dinosaurs used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a mask system that uses many of today's animals.
Experts claim that it enabled him to climb better with their surroundings and avoid enemies. The mask system indicates that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News about the 110 million-year-old dinosaurs of the Nodosauridae family appeared for the first time in newspapers in May. Currently, it is available to see at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli after the technician of the museum Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team, carefully detecting the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the forms and forms of foam and guns across the body.
They revealed the mask method that are commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this mask effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising because Borealopelta’s size far beyond today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution gave preference to masking before confrontation.
Many of the current animals with mask - such as beans, zebras, or beans - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a crust, indicating that the nosodaurus had to fight for his surviving literally.
“The traitor of a huge and severely reversed dinosaur clearly illustrates the dangers of the predators during the ring period,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the shells also revealed that the skin dinosaurs probably had red-brown coloring.
The researchers continue to study the animal and look for further knowledge about his life, including the conservative content of his stomach to consume his last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after his death and was thrown into the sea where he flooded to the bottom.
In the region of Alberta at that time, the same night as today’s Florida and rivers, and the oceans went much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is fully covered in perfectly preserved shaved skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically like the time of the wings.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just a little bit of the eye and it looks like it just sleeps.”
During the era of the wings, enormous terropods walked around the Earth, massising dinosaurs who moved on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived a few million years after Borealopelta, this reversed dinosaur could have been the favorite of his equally horrible ancestors.
Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster with a weight of more than 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta’s body was flooded into the sea after it was mumphicized in the bath.
Shawn Funk, who revealed the rocky rock on March 21, 2011 during the rolling down at Suncor Millenium near Canadian Alberta.
According to the museum, this is the best preserved reverse dinosaur in the world, including skin and arms, which is also complete from the chest to the pillow.
The animal reached an average of 5 meters long and weighed up to 1300 kg.
From his shoulders, two hundred and fifty centimeters were wrapped.
Researchers believe that this bullshit broke the territory of today’s Canada until it ends in the river that floods it into the sea.
His submarine tomb retained the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this kind are also preserved to the extent that the rotated plates around the foam still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to the winning in the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the shocking findings seem to me.
Fossil residues of this kind are also preserved to the extent that the rotated plates around the foam still cover the remains of the skin.
Behind him is his right front leg with his fingers heading upwards.
I'm easy to count on his pedestrian."
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell crashed around the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, St. Louis’s family sitting in bed at Airbnb’s room and browsing Facebook posts on her phone.
She was injured by a high school student’s contribution.
“The police just shot a 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that nobody else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah constantly retweet her posts on the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis posted his posts on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a white-skin cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which lies uncontrollably on the street, from where no one took her away even after four hours.
“It’s crazy,” said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She delayed her phone to come back to him the evening she watched tweets about the people gathered on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed that he was the victim's father and held a cedule in his hand with the title "Ferguson Police Killed My Unarmed Son"!
She watched live news - one of the police were standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a guide in her hand and on the other end of a screwed dog.
In another video, another policeman, as she said, held in her hand a gun that he was looking at, shouting, "I'll kill you all... animals."
“It’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This is not the kind of murder we have used to and we can call it normal.
I felt a dirty skin all over the body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She booked her return flight and on the other day she left home.
After landing at 23:00, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which will be introduced into the film on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, power and incomparableness, told from the point of view of people living in the community who are expelled into the streets and demanding answers.
On the journey to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced dialogue with her daughter - dressed in flower dress and the same flower head - on the theme that they had discussed many times - "on the experience of blackness".
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed?” she recalls a conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I didn't think I wouldn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the . . . that has happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it in her own eyes and grow in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to recognize the difference between the various layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do to get rid of.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I would protect her from this experience, I would just harm her.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop of the South Florissant Road was against the police department, which became the base of activists expected by the policeman Darren Wilson's words of his possible participation in the incident.
Here Ferrell met her daughter with the local entrepreneur who prepared for other meals.
Together they prepared food in their bags and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
“My activism turned up after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that at a study at the University of Missouri-St. Louis University, she was chairman of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. Association and strived to introduce health care and food in Montenegro communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met her later director Sabaah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “just document” the events taking place.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
Such a type of skepticism penetrated into the community through many people, often white people who wanted to earn for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unexpected interview: “We have heard the voices of people who are born and grown up in Ferguson are very often forgotten, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, a recognized local artist who is dealing with the subjects of prisoners in the whole of death.
His participation in the project was also impaired by Ferrell and the other six locals who watched the “Whose Streets” team in the years following the murder of Brown.
“No one speaks for us in this document, but that’s our statement,” Davis said.
“It was important for me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way.”
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about a rescue leader, but about a closer community," Folayan said - it turned out that she is the most open to the participation in filming.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes Ferrell's very personal aspect of life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said smiling on her face when she thought at the first moment she looked at the final version of the document.
"But I realized that in order to do this job and pollute the blacks, I have to open myself."
Ferrell’s story also emphasizes the role of black women in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter – call themselves wonders.
“Black-centric women in leadership positions are behind the conservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black middle-class women must endure the silence of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of central black women.”
It remains, however, that "this is not just a affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
“It was the power and energy source,” she said.
“It’s not the case that she felt in front lines, because life on these cruises in the skin of a black stranger woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of television stations cleaned their position, but the heavy racial footage between the community and the police continues.
Ferrell denied two-and-a-half years' condition for blocking the road at demonstrations.
A socially political atmosphere in the area that she called home as a "disordency."
However, she does not stand in her effort to be committed from the moment she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
The field was burned in Corinth.
Dozens of hammers went out to the place, helping the helicopter.
Near the Czech Boat in Colombia, between the municipalities of Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares has burned from 14:00 a.m.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, and the hackers announced the third degree of firefighting of four possible.
According to the spokesman Ladislav Holomczyk, heavily fired the helicopter.
At 18:00, the fire was removed, causing damage to 700000 crowns.
There are dozens of professional and volunteer fighters on the ground.
The fire occurred due to a technical failure in the motor space of a combination.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, who carried out six water shoes in total.
"The place of the intervention we passed to the owners until tomorrow's 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer hackers," Holomczyk said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms in the New York Fridman Gallery, there are just a few different faces of skin - white, black and eating - hanged from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seems to look out of the eye.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouth-tooth and hair extracts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst denied a 35-year punishment for unlawful disclosure of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is named A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneer dissidence, whose punishment has been reduced by Obama three days before his departure of the US president.
Algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person would look with this genotype, Dewey-Hagborg has created a brick, unless an intellectual comment on DNA obedience - as well as many ways DNA can be interpreted - and with the same meaningless interpretation of these determinism.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has since talked about being considered a woman in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including a violation of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison employees. Only one low-quality black-white photo escaped to the public, where Manning, visiblely worried, sits at the driver's seat in a platinum blonde pause with which she is now connected.
In 2015, the Dewey-Hagborg project of 2012 Stranger Visions was still positive.
Within this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects, such as a few cigarettes and swabs, to create an image of possible figures of these people.
And right now she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits or photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if they were interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her incarcerated museum were scamred in two years through a correspondence.
They even created a comedy called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which introduced a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was loved and could take part in the exhibitions personally.
President Obama asked for the release of Manning a few days after the release of the comics, which was a welcome change after several intolerant years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting that the exhibition is taking place at the time when Donald Trump leads a war against people striving to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to promote the lockdown in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this special time, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for some reason."
Under the declaration of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls her huge signature (the "i" in the name is excited by the heart) after the end of "a self-activated fractionary based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the other hand, there are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - the stonyst of the letters C, G and A recorded by the torch.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least by the biological side, we all were.
“I hope that people will find that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective, and that everyone can explain it on their own,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novel.
It shows Manning, who is a King Kong's way from the United States Discipline Barracks with a megaphone in hand.
As soon as they prevent you from speaking, they will win.
“Never leave silence.”
“It’s a direct retrieve from one of the letters,” said the Philadelphian artist.
“When I think of it, my skin is shaking.”
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - what was predicted in the comic - but as soon as that happens, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome patterns, classified as a dam of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm high Maning's sockets, on which its genetic haplosgroups are recorded with a tray.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to send a feeling of dancing from them," Dewey-Hagborg said on portraits.
“I wanted instructions about the impression of mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and releases it.”
Professor of Northwest University and an employee of Oxford University looking for murder
In these days, a global search for Professor of Northwest University and employees of Oxford University who are accused of the murder of a man who was found buried to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, he was arrested for the first-grade murder of the men named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged co-participation to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, a court record said in Cook County.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several points of injury.
The Chicago police said the dead body was found on July 27.
Police were warned by phone, and after arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the ground and detectives investigated the case as a murder, while the police investigated both suspects, the authorities said.
Lathem has been a docent of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwest since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Communications, said in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was prohibited from entering the university’s schools.
"The entire issue is now investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at the University of Oxford.
The spokesperson at Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wished to join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public contact with the Chicago Police Department, said he called for suspects to give up with the competent authorities.
“The police have information about their place of residence and the attempt to arrest suspects is increasing,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that they are assisted by local, regional and global authorities in search of suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a telephone call from the Grand Plaza building manager, who was warned about the events that had to happen in the apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as a very violent one.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza leader issued a statement to all residents: “The police are now working to create a time overview and a victim’s profile and investigate various motifs, including domestic violence.”
"We will complete the WADA plan in the future" - Vice-President of the Russian Government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian government, Vitaly Mutko, said it would not take long and the remaining criteria of the World Antidoping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Antidoping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
“A part of the new plan has already been completed, and RUSADA has already gained the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the UK Antidoping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the RUSADA criteria for renewal - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to the Mutka Code, there is nothing that Russia should worry about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the above criteria, however, calls after the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation investigated by Richard McLaren, on the alleged sponsorship of Russian doping athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We know the investigation because our anti-doping system has apparently failed.
All measures have been adopted.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we can’t admit anything that has never existed.”
Mutkova’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In a Russian interview with RSport Smirnov, he admitted the problems of Russian antidoping agents, but added: “Once to many occasions, we stated that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
"No one is planning to accept the report completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of conducting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 directly before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of tests under the supervision of international experts and the British Antidoping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the Moscow Center of the organization in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “on the right path” to renew its validity.
Police accused three people, one is a young man.
Police accused three men of founding a Wednesday fire on a rare wooden church in Trinity-Gutech in Frýdecko-Místec.
One accused is a young man, all three are Czech nationality.
They are in danger of up to 15 years of imprisonment for a criminal offence.
This is what Moravskoskoslez Police Director Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh issue and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole issue," Kužel said.
He said the police would act on the possibility of arresting the accused.
Further information may not be published, according to the Director.
“I can’t tell you more yet, because the criminal police and investigation and the state prosecutor are actually working on matters,” Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and pictures from the first half of the 16th century.
The substantial damage is expected to go to tens of millions of dollars, but historical loss is incalculable.
The fire began to think about the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, for additional costs it is prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and City, the public collection is also prepared and calculated with the contribution of the monument owner, namely the local farm.
A similar 16th-century wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Hrabova also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
It was a failure at the time of an electrical installation.
Then there were precise copies in his place.
The state counts with citizens in the defense of the state.
They will support their training.
With financial support for associations to be used in the defense of the state, with a voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the actual intention of the law on the preparation of citizens for the defense of the state is calculated.
The Ministry of Defense, which has received its processing as a task from the government, promises that it will thus be able to increase the physical capacity of the Czechs and their ability to be used in crisis situations.
This is based on the proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law would be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns regularly in support of defense.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to establish an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of the defense duties and on the basis of voluntary.
For example, the State would support the associations of radio-amators, shooters or cynologists financially or materially and would allow the capacity of their members to increase.
In return, he would obtain information about people who are willing to come to the country at the time of the crisis, and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors may also be available to assist associations and other stakeholders in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who kept themselves heroically.
One of the possible variants assumes the establishment of a new office, which should be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state should use their capabilities only after the state of threat.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual abduction of the previously obvious boundaries between the individual types of threats," he said in a reference to the danger of so-called hybrid threats.
Minister officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as much as possible, not only the military.
"The main objective of the intention is to create a very broad base that enables every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations that threaten state supremacy or life, the health and property of individuals, to protect himself, to contribute to the protection of others, and not to harm the performance of the tasks of the Republicans with armed forces."
The adoption of the law would bring little financial claims.
The above will depend on the chosen variant, according to the Ministry.
The Agency, for example, assumes financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of up to 100 million kroons.
If an administrative and coordination centre was established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the country's military commands should be extended, which would involve 42 more soldiers together.
Representatives of the Ministry have already stated that the law should also help resolve disagreement between certain Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union's arms holding Directive.
Its adoption would allow shooters who are part of the system to hold some of the weapons that the Directive provides.
Startups that will help your company to avoid the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often unprecedented, inutilized, or even crying.
And although she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their lack of trust in the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectiveness," said Errett, owner of e-commerce company Madison Reed, headquartered in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New startups from human resources are constantly on the market, helping the company to investigate employee satisfaction.
By creating and licensed software with a specific intention of measuring employees' duties, startups allow companies to perform rapid votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, also offer total anonymity of employees and a hot line of contact to complaints, and in some cases also inform the applicants.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company,” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint, headquartered in Reedwood City.
Errett stated that thanks to Glint, she has gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company’s temperature map and a common overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a overview of low-valued managers - allowing users to work on repair.
Companies begin to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is rejected in scandals after a former employee has published a post on his blog describing the business environment and disturbance of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for business culture surveys represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which focuses on technical and financial advances, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect misconduct, has seen a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber’s scandals.
Almost 600 Conversion customers include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also recently received under his wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "gloss" surveys, collect confidential information in real time and display temperature maps in problems areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hot line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
“The Court of Public Opinions has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent startup.
If a company is condemned for misconduct with its employees or non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulator does not violate - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee exhaustion or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people in over 500 locations, uses Convercent for more than a year to increase employee awareness of corporate principles and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to monitor the telephone number or email to the company’s leadership, officially file a complaint and hope in apparent solution.
It was often a terrifying and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, General Representative Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no reliable way of tracking employee complaints before.
Now that the company uses Convercent, a quick detection and solution of problems that have never been available to managers, sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution of complaints, such as discrimination, disturbance or unfair treatment.
"It's closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," Vitrano, who is headed by the Ruby Tuesday group overseer of risk management.
“We are protecting the shareholders from judicial disputes by employees.”
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation to light weight in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron fell in terms of the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when the social media has been dedicated to the whole thing, companies began to realize that in the online world they can’t simply hide their churches in the cabinet.
"Before people began to use technology ethics, they rely on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by brave capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose $10 million in its February campaign from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and eventually took off $47 million.
Glint earned $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising due to the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
The growing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect from their workplace more than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, it is not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to realize that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time in a company that seeks a positive job.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employment Benefits of LinkedIn, who uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn if they succeed and companies prosper if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is not surprising that there will be a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data itself is meaningless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as the company requests a feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disruption of employees.
“When you ask for 4,000 opinions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, advisory director at Kotter International, who was witness to many companies who rely too much on data.
“When you don’t get things to the end, employees will start asking themselves, ‘Have they heard me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it be interested in me?"
Madison Reed, which is now regularly conducting a survey among employees every month, can solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, said Errett.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett managed to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday gains a very important look at its employees and hopes that it will achieve high employment in a field that is known for frequent dismissal.
“If you are not trying to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you,” Vitrano added.
“As soon as you start to lose your employees, you’ll get to customers.
And with the impact of customers, the whole company is ruined."
Thursday has become the warmest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Watchtower of Hodon.
He overcame the strike, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
They were informed by the staff of the Czech Institute of Hydrometeorological Sciences.
Compared to Tuesday, there weren’t many temperature records.
Vedra struck Morava mainly, mostly cloudy in Czechoslovakia.
On Tuesday, records were overcome or balanced to 35 out of 145 weather stations measured for over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term meters were recorded.
Today’s temperature was probably the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica in Brzeclavska today, the original maximum exceeded 37.4 degrees by four tens of degrees, and in Pohorzeliks in Brno, the current record exceeded 37.1 degrees by three tens of degrees.
Both records as well as in the Watchtower came from 2013.
High temperatures have emerged today mainly in the south and east of Morava.
After the Watchtower, the largest lead was in Dyyakovics on Znojemska and Boda nad Dyji in Brzeclavska, where the rota was consistently expanded to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not overcome.
For example, in the western and northern Czechs, the highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius, according to the website of the Czech Republic.
“The temperatures began to rise until now later in the afternoon,” meteorologians said.
Current leads in the Czech Republic will gradually be reflected, and even more significant rain may occur on Sunday.
In most places in Morava, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Morava on Saturday.
We've got that kind of noise here.
Millionaires are not enough the same voice in the elections as every single full-year-old in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as brave as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burdou and Antonin Fryche, sponsor Robeck Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in real estate Pavel Sehnal, who is also his president.
The convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valent has defeated the Party of Privates.
The political movement of Agrofert, as the project of Andreje Babiše did not want to name the Mayor of the Crowd Cross Jaroslav German, is the chapter itself.
His billionaires have also recently been caught by the oldest.
It is Dalibor Grandpa, the owner of the company of Jablotron security equipment.
According to his own words, he goes into politics to do good.
But grandfather's intrusion in the city was failed very much.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to move YES to win the Oldest Movement by 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo is ridiculous.
But grandfather's disregard is rather arrogant.
Millionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of solid opinions.
Although he intends to speak of the voices of the electors in the Old Town, he continues to support Andreje Babishe.
Granny’s grandfather supported in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Baby isn't a fired speaker and will not rule the lovely retoric of political herds," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But it is not in politics because it wants to improve itself personally.
My grandmother will be a hero for me.
He is willing to come out of his world, who is under control, and do something for us all.
Shortly after the Oldests introduced him as a new reinforcement, he recognized his admiration to Grandpa again.
And he said he wants the oldest to learn possible cooperation with Grandpa.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn’t change his opinions and stand behind him regardless of what dress he’s wearing.
Others can speculate whether Babiš sends to the Stars to build his beans of someone that is so unmotorized.
Others may be wondering whether the boss of Jablotron, for example, has not been born in bad business with boss of Agrofert and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
The first grandfather’s public performance was not just around Grandma’s.
His grandfather promised to send the Elders ten million crowns for a campaign.
And when they say they need more money, they will send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop a similar statement.
Finally, the judicially recognized gauner Znenek Bakala had spread millions to all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárty, TOP 09 and civil democrats have come together for nearly thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone to give more than three million political parties.
When Grandpa is already in politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe he shouldn’t ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics then Grandpa crowned a proposal for the tax benefit of families with students.
People with higher education will come to us at about fifty thousand per month.
They're the basics of less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in this situation.
He's 20-year-old.
In the vision of the grandparents of the society, the taxes are honestly paid and the rich take advantage of the benefits of the functioning of the social state, to which they are not too involved.
In short, rich people need to help not get rid of poverty in an emergency.
Older men can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and grandparents take their hands.
We can also confirm by Grandpa that billionaires aren’t worthy of people.
There is still a question for whom to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who have no members and members of their party, neither nationals nor nationals of the State, for their employees nor for their property.
And, finally, those who want to live well in the rich land to all people, not just some.
Trump’s paradise didn’t want anyone.
The wild complex had to reduce 234 million.
Real estate sales are sometimes not easy.
And many times it will not help him even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
In the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price of 8 million pounds fell down.
He informed the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape from the place like no other.
However, the connection of real estate company with the U.S. President did not defend an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean seat by an incredible 8 million pounds.
The original price of the property was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after discount, the villa complex is approximately 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And it's not surprising.
The charming seat of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of Svaty Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is also a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of fires on the ground.
The terrace has a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the fact that connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now real estate is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to the speculation, he paid about £15 million.
The property should be purchased for rent purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, they are ranked in the second place.
The property in the neighbourhood was awarded 13.5 million pounds.
NCAA decided to terminate two trainings a day. For Bruins long days
The eleventh morning approaches, and American football players at the UCLA’s cats at the side lines of the new school court.
Some of them wear dresses and reveal a rated back, unclean sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members of these few minutes, no-working is suppled with a pool break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting held next morning at 6:30.
“For these boys, there will be a good triangle for the next three days,” said coach Bruins Jim Mora a few minutes before the stop on Tuesday.
By eliminating two trainings per day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - so at least until Friday when the final tests are completed.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled for 19:15 - to enter the already overwhelmed diary of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons that Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the training camp Bruins begins a week before last year and training is limited during the summer semester. Its influence on it also has the decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
In total, eighteen trainings will be scheduled by August 20, and formal preparations will begin for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which will take place in September.
Mora was allowed to hear that he supports NCAA decisions, although he added another item to the already loaded player diary.
“Tree or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will be calm.”
UCLA will be closed after the training camp is completed, which will not be easy to view the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and Luskin Center luxury hotel, which players have deployed after climbing the protective grid.
The Bruins players should have a hotel from this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there may be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
It is well traded with such material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be protected, as well as parking number 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will work well.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans to closer check the facts to limit the number of fake messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display findings under the original contributions in an attempt to fight the so-called fake news, the largest social network said Thursday.
The company’s statement on its website writes that it will begin to use updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxs, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original posts.
Facebook has been named one of the main sources of fake reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the US president’s last election.
French voters are flooded with false reports on the May presidential elections, and Germany plans to impose a penalty on the social media network with prejudice before the elections of November, if they do not quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said on Thursday in its next statement in Germany that it will launch a new testing of fake message control function in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to viewing third-party messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and to be able to correctly decide what they can share,” said Sara Su, product manager on Facebook’s blog.
He added that Facebook continues to test the “related articles” feature and also works on further changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Graphic novels: A Castle in England
The small castle Scotney Castle recently played a major role in Squeeze's music video clip, and Margaret Thatcher found her place in it during the 1970s and 80s.
Scotney, however, was a witness of 700 years of storm history from his cosy location at the Bewl River in the British Kent, which inspired Jamie Rhodese from York County, a well-known interest in historical documents, to create a graphic novel.
“A look at the letter of a man that is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
A Castle in England documentates the lives of families that lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardo period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first book of Rhodes inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired documents of the British library - a project that was very emotional for him.
“He took me a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobity,” he said.
“It’s his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time you had to burn a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, about 300 years later, it's like I'd come back in time.
I love the archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying nearly four months in the castle almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, exploring the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyphen on the walls and bottles that have been poured into the grove for centuries.
He walked through the ground and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the devils, gardeners, and sometimes also to the artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the evening, he “drank whiskey and wrote.”
Scotney’s confidential history is relatively unknown, since National Trust had access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived in the place ten years later, the employees began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described, such as when “aristocrates of many centuries shook hands with the words: ‘Bring it to the roof.’”
Journals, letters from the British Empire era, maps showing property: "You may think that the dispute about the land is boring," Rhodes said, "but I hit a case when two families crossed the coast.
"Let the people go!"
Some stories in the book make use of the castle as a reflective castle and are deeper into English history, including a story named The Labourer, watching a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
“I found a record of the rebellion in 1380’s castle, which was in the book called Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually began in this area and I thought uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe they will eventually be related to each other.”
The other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whose Darrel's family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century wizard named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly censored his own funeral when he filled the rock rack (which was discovered only a few years after the discovery of the rack).
Rhodes’ favourite family are Darrel’s: “I was excited by the men’s generations – the men of that time were always debtors and spent money on things they couldn’t allow themselves.
"Several generations of Darrell's family treated it by taking rich or old panics - I imagine they were looking ladies who preferably prayed for the heads of the heirs."
With the end of your stay in the castle, Rhodes searches after other adventures.
Recently he returned from a two-week staircase in a Finnish wildlife, where he inspired his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was swallowed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now I'm going to go back to real life.'"
Washington changes the terms of green card issuance
The media published President Donald Trump’s words on a new U.S. immigration plan, in which there will also be a change in the award of a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to decrease by 50,000 annually due to stricter rules for temporary working visas and family visa restrictions.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and Presidents.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This Act will reduce poverty, increase wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, by amending the green card issuance rules to residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process is a priority for English-speaking applicants who rely on financial resources and demonstrate the ability to benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be watching
Just as it seemed that 2017 could not be stranger, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the internet.
Yeah, yeah.
Sexual robots are very popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to consider the rise of sexual robots seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color, the shape of brass and the appearance of the robot nails.
“People are slowing down, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more and more frequently,” Sharkey said.
The modern sexual aid turns from sweating men into robotic women with silicone leather, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course, artificial intelligence is similar to man's behavior.
The user can "modify" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the brass to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it’s very worrying that many robots have their own “personality” that would deceive Stepford’s panic.
Modern fucking virgins have developed into robotic women with silicone leather.
RealBotix’s robot owner can set up different character characteristics, including shame.
And then there is a sexual robot woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including the Frigid Farrah, which is characterized by a shameful nature and the “divine Wendy” with a “congratulated” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold is set to match your personality as far as possible,” True Companion’s website says.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even humorous, just like people.
It can be tired, speechless or “in mood”.
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for a number of reasons - among which there is no replacement for real interhuman relationships. Anxious rather are female character characteristics and violent strikes - e.g. frigid (refusing) Farrah.
True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
"When a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't her husband have Roxxxy?" she wrote on the page.
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication indicate somewhat darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a recession from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for subhuman sex with an optional affection.
Most men, of course, don’t buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still on the edge of the interests of the broad public.
However, this extreme interest can become a mirror set up in modern times.
And most of the people are not strange or violent until the free market forgets them.
It is not the case that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world exercise their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House, who often expresses himself very annoyed at the address of the women.
The most terrifying aspect of the series The Story of the Servant is not what we see - the enveloped bodies and the enveloped eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots have to look as much like real women as possible (which needs pornstars).
Their creators build them so that they can be pleasant to touch and act at first glance as a true woman.
However, when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't leave with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would stimulate their independence or disturb their commitment to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Greeks of the 21st century: servants.
The NBA star on the green.
Curry fights for cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose his first defeat at a premiere start among professional golfers.
The double award holder for the most useful NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lowest series Web.com Tour in the California Hayward first round for 74 wounds and will fight for cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title with the Warriors team in the NBA this season, began a lot of nervous and his first shot ended in a beverage tank in a golf car parked at the fairway.
Even though it wasn't as accurate among the jackets as under the basketball basket, it left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four wounds over the pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, you have to call the arbitrator right after the first fire, but then you sit a little bit," Curry said.
It was very nervous to burn the first wound in the tournament, but it was all I hoped.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cute that will probably be determined by two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better the next time and now, when I get rid of the trees, it'll probably go," said a golfer who had already played celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts at Hayward for the first time a PGA tournament.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he gained a sponsoring exception and maintained amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump’s great victory?
Mitt Romney is a bodybuilding of a healthy sense.
Trump’s era’s unfair sign becomes political divisions that are distributed by American voters and microwave the whole family.
During the period of Christmas and Thanksgiving, in American newspapers, it was suggested how to consult with relatives who choose Trump.
We're supposed to wait until we get nervous.
However, less attention is devoted to Trump’s ability to oppose the family.
I'm talking about this because this week my cousin visited me in New York, a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who paid for a Republican fool for a long time in our family.
She reminded me that the swelling of the face in the face of a common enemy may have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family - including all Republican brothers who have been talking about politics for years - is on a wave.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but it affects me that in a wider context it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all off the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to a terrifying possibility that his sharks can lose one day on attractiveness.
However, there is even a more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" lawmaker republicans who, opposing his standards, will be surprised by enlarging what can be called rational.
Today, with nostalgia in the heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy talk - a dog on the car roof, 14% of the income tax (at least we had knowledge of his tax recognition) - of which both examples look very mild compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, the following Republican candidate is enough to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and took the children to Central Park on the largest pillar that operates the New York Park Department - for your three dollars you will not find a better use, so you don't need caffeine.
Horses are gigantic, the middle wheel is covered with glass - clowns and animals scream and in terror look at their own shoulders - completely cloudy look and zinc music resembles public transport.
Many klishes will soon be limited: a view from the heights of the buildings, the panorama is surrounded by, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not fit your imaginations.
Fifty years later, I still didn’t realize that Swiss Cottage wasn’t actually Swiss cheese – he doesn’t count the thematic shelter of Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but the London subway station.
Nevertheless, the pillow in Central Park triggers a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, are greatly enjoyed.
If I could evaluate the column, he would deserve the maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my "experience" at a stage from one to five when I paid credit cards.
In the cafe at the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can get to the rating 15% awarded for something I'm buying behind my table.
Not only that it delays otherwise fast sales, but the server is forced to enter strictly buyers when it is not necessary.
A woman in the store asked me with a smile when I uncertainly appreciated my credit card transfer to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for breast pain
This is the second time Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year he was treated for cutting wounds on the back, which, according to a prisoner's statement, he caused himself after falling into the cell.
Pistorius was sentenced to murder after appealing to the original murder sentence.
Steenkamp killed her girlfriend in the early mornings at Valentine's Day in 2013 with a few shotguns through the door of the toilet cabinet in his home in Pretori.
Pistorius argued that he robbed her with a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to repeal, this time against the six-year-old punishment of Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the court proceedings will take place this year.
In case of success, Pistorius is at risk of prolonging the penalty for up to 15 years.
In South Africa there is no death penalty.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in captivity a hidden panda in the wild.
This is a huge success for the pand rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genofond of the pands grown in prison.
The centre’s employee, Čang Č-čung, told New China’s agency that farming pands are at a high risk due to the relative crossing.
In prison, at the end of last year, there were only 471 pans.
There are only two thousand survivors in the free nature.
Snaha is the first step in growing pands to help protect this species.
The fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reserve at the beginning of the pandy parting period on 11 March.
Thanks to the tracking device on the throat, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
He met his elected man Cchao-Choe 12 days later.
Sexual contact with a male pandy took a minute and a half and succeeded.
Even this can be regarded as a small miracle because the males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal empire.
Males relatively poorly estimate the time when females are ready, in addition, they are often confused and don’t know what to do.
The young woman was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn pan is 70 grams lower.
Two Bullers were arrested for illegal camps in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camps, the bTV said.
A group of tourists, including two Bullers, was arrested on 1 August in the morning by the Sithon police.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said for bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have suspended the rules of free campsites and put severe penalties on anyone who is assaulted in a place where campsites are not allowed.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine.

Twenty-year-old Czech player is so hoping that he will go through cute at the famous major for the first time.

Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are taking millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry animals due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch Food Safety Supervisory Authority of the NVWA said it investigated 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, which means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identified by specific figures.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a risk for adults, but it is a potential threat for children.
Petr Majer, spokesman of the Czech SVS, said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities even joined the closing of the farms, have recently not been injured in the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians take samples of domestic eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on which markets have emerged problem marks of insecticide.
The Belgian eggs were last on the Czech market in April and the Netherlands last in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of bleach, all and crystalline preparations.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation slightly toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of anxiety and anxiety.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says Seláček golman and is looking for commitment.
I'd like to catch 10 years.
"Maybe I'm going back there once," laughed the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the line-up.
It depends on whether it gets a new year to start.
What were the four years you experienced in Latvia?
If I'd have to evaluate it in school, then in three.
In the first year I didn’t take too much, I had an experienced goalman before me.
I learned.
The next year I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new goal, with which I changed again.
Last year I thought I was going to catch it all the time.
But in the first ten matches, we probably won only five points, so the coaches started to play.
At the end of the day, my colleague had more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to keep it up for the next season.
What was life in Riga?
Great.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historical city.
I'll miss it.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together in the third year, next year we're going to marry.
So I took something.
How Required is KHL for Gateways?
The first 10 teams are really high quality.
Then there are teams like us or Slovenians who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other hand, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I haven't seen a problem in the area.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
Less shots, and even if they have a semi-free door in front of them, they prefer to record.
In the Czech Republic, more are shots.
Didn’t you have a problem traveling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep calmly.
The program is usually done so that you can play four games outside and then have two days off.
How do the Latvians see their club at KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball is a national sport.
They're all fans.
Even though it failed, a lot of people went.
Did the action of Dinama in KHL help Latvia at the this year's World Cup hardly get to the quarter-finals?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since the same time, their results for the World Cup began to rise up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, it fell at 1:2 in the quarter-finals with Canada.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are going to the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts was held in Zlína and before the contract was signed by Ralfs Freibergs.
What's going on with so many of them here?
They're not a balloon player, they're really high quality.
These teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unemployed?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn’t continue in Riga.
With this fall we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget on the goal, we didn't agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked with different teams, but in the final we decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlyna and I'm waiting for something to appear.
You're not nervous about that?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home for some time.
I've picked up something in KHL, so I'm going to take it differently.
The question just sounds when and where to sign.
How real is the possibility that you’re going to the new year in Zlína?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month when what's going on.
Now I can just wait for the agent to deal.
Do you prefer any competition?
The last season wasn’t so that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's relief at Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in article S of the care of a good economist? I also wrote about the camp in Letech near Orly.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me recall the difficult passports of the article.
We have been talking about the camp in Lech for many years.
For readers who don’t know exactly what it’s about, it’s probably best to look at, for example, the official website of the cultural monuments of Pietnía instead of Lety.
In the introduction of a historical overview, it is found that the camp was two kilometers east of the municipality of Lety, serving as a work camp since 8.8.1940, was a collection camp since 1.1.242, and since 2.8.42 became a Cican camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the transportation of Ossetians.
On 4. 5. 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the exit camp.
A total of them were 420.
Very sad stories of the incomparable blows of human beings that have caused them to be human beings again and the cruel ideology.
There is no dispute about the need to remember these events constantly.
There is no dispute about the fact that this reminder should take place at the monument in the place of suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism was a little forgotten, and in the 70s of the 20s he was constructed close to and on the part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a monument was discovered in the Years.
In the mid-90s of the 20th century, the government promised the redemption and destruction of the veins, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009, its report is under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Committee on Human Rights called for the Czech Republic to close the chicken.
There are so many short facts about the destiny of the camp.
In autumn, the government approved the purchase of the chicken and decided to draw up an expert assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then be redeemed.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, “There are no numbers, but I would probably consider those intentions if I would go with them to the public.”
Let's see what will bring the expert assessment.
According to some informal estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can be up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be a cheap case.
And while just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state has invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the UN Committee on Human Rights has been financed beautifully throughout the transaction, which is obviously not at risk, I think it would be the same to withdraw money.
Does the government have other priorities?
A memorial, a decent place, stands the will of history almost near the immediate tragedy, and anyone wants can be given here the memorials of suffering and murder.
I don’t see any reason to change this!
Let's keep it as it is, and keep the feeding place with maximum care.
The person responsible, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should take care of the proper economics, for the assigned property, and also for the money of the taxpayers.
At least as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Vice-President of the Government are not the entire government.
But I still perceive, from the viewpoint of the above facts, the leader of the ANO movement's password was only as an empty pre-election proclaimed.
This year, in May, I went to look at the place.
Very decent arrival road, adjusted parking, replicas of wooden campsites.
In one exhibition, in the second integrated toilet with flowing water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating possibility and views on its own sweater, which is made of stones located in a mild swap.
Lots of flowers and flowers.
All attributes correspond to the significance of this site as it suits and belongs.
Currently, archaeological research is underway in the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the open grounds could be preserved and at least visually accessible.
In this way, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could make his efforts.
In the event that the government will be able to earn a refund for state money, it will only be another unfortunate step in its already quite problematic action in the role of Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve symptoms of inflammatory intestinal diseases (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory intestinal diseases.
An unhealthy disease that affects up to 1.3 million U.S. populations and 300,000 patients in the UK causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in protein helps to create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, head of a study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the removal of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue.
Once the mushrooms tend to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory intestinal disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells that promote body tolerance in the stomach with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to create cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophans they had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it proves the same for humans, then the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and diets rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of testing mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice grown separately lost cells.
It led to the fact that one group of mice has different intestinal microbes - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse intestine was tested by a DNA classification method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missed by the second mouse group.
Myths that were captured in a sterile environment and missed intestinal microbes - they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given to L. reuteri bacteria - and they created immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuters in the liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without a bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells kept in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it has been shown to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octane acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophan in the mice diet, the number of these cells increased by 50%. After dissolution of the doses of tryptophan, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri bacteria cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Every of us should endeavor to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria can increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers signing a contract with Neman Matić and his transition to Manchester United as ‘genial’
Manchester United won a "geny" in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least José Mourinho thinks that after the backup debut in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £40 million contract, enrolled in the first winning 2:1 match in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meets Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a backup for Paul Pogby and Andrease Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the Asian seasonal tournament, Matić did not have a form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinha, must be engaged before the next season of the Premier League.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent, and has genial thoughts," Mourinho said.
"We can help him get into condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new co-player Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho slowly begins to form their eleventh for the next season.
The independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with the other three players, but it takes the club to conduct a "fantasy job" and bring three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would have enjoyed me more, but I admit they made the best for me.”

This multi-promised image began to rise thanks to the new TV series Prima Zdenjk Academy.
The boss instantly smells the chance.
“Dear Zdenka, I would like to sign up to your cooking academy because I think I can learn a lot from you,” he said in a social media video.
And since they've been upstairs for a couple of years, I've never forgotten to irritate him this time.
"For the benefit of this, I can teach you a snack from a diet of chicken meat, American chicken or invite you to water and show you why it's your favorite brown cheese."
His participation in Pohlreich's new show is really serious.
It’s time to move to a higher level and learn from the Master.
"The question is what the boss is about," Blesku said.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he recorded new parts of his next order Yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Hruška’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole issue as his personal activity outside of television.
Gross Pohlreich planted his first cook in December 2004.
In a few days, more than 300,000 pieces were sold!
The new order introduced by Prima at the press conference for the autumn broadcast scheme is a fake cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from a range of viewers and meets them in twelve works with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now, the boss cooks in November 2014, Zneňek left the back of his trick to look at the overwhelming toy.
If I had my face there, I would laugh a lot.
"I'm just laughing over that brush - the brush is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ice Cream said.
The Culinary Arts of Culinary Arts are thoughtful.
"Cook, according to Ladi Hruška, does not come into consideration either at home because I will not leave gastropunk at home," the boss said.
I just appreciate Pohlreich's soap, even I'm making chickens for honey.
In my order, however, his recipes will certainly not be revealed,” he said.
He's a fool!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clone.
"Gastronomic analfabete or idiot," Pohlreich said about Hruškov at a lecture.
"I don't have twenty to be able to handle them, but I'm not going to solve them anymore," he said in a statement.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hands to open the car and the house by scratching
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. Simply turning his hand can unlock the door from the house and office and even start a car.
Steven Northam, a thirty-year-old, has been able to implant a small chip between the fingertips and the fingertips and currently offers the same service through BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist of the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, is supervised by the implantation and compliance procedure.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northamo's company also offers a door and car exchange service that is compatible with a microchip. The price of one slot is £300.
The married father of one child has allowed the technology to integrate into his home and his car, the BMW Z4, which starts with a simple handbreak.
The White House Request Costs Taxers of Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly with a naval helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. industry last month came to $24,000, according to the TIME weekly naval records.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the 17th July program in the White House, which was an overview of the U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and several High Officers of the White House reviewed the product overview from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was exposed next to the yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin-wizard car and a Mississippi-wizard lift car.
The Military Officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of helicopters less than 36 hours before the landing of the helicopters to South Lawn within the "exceptional" event, the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records - the helicopter responsible for the management.
“I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event,” HMX-1 wrote in an email to his supervisor, the representative of the Marine Marine the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at 7:00 p.m. for an overview, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 p.m. and will remain on the spot until the entire location is complete, scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The e-mail also stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a substitute crew will be sent for return years due to the working time regulation.
The original crew stayed on the spot that evening along with the helicopter and with them a security unit.
From the records - which he received a TIME week - was not visible whether the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible violations of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were sure that everything is okay,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like they're blocking you," said the Chief Deputy.
This overview "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
Even the official events have political subtexts.
At his participation in the event, the president promoted a health reform that passed through the Senate and talked about an effort to maintain a government regulation.
The use of aviation means such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
They are used by the presidents when traveling.
However, their presence is unusual for presentation reasons.
Trump ordered checks in February after the presidential plane crashed in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of the presidential plane of his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the overview of ‘Made in America’, which introduced products from all 50 countries that Americans manufactured from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a press secretary.
The HMX-1 helicopter crew often trains landing in Washington and South Lawn and trains possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 took 58 training landings at the White House.
The Made in America flight was part of the current crew training, state agent said.
The same day, the helicopter unit found another 11 hours within the “non-Presidential Support Missions”.
The White House stated that no further recruitment was taken from the taxpayers' money.
Speaker Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in negotiations on helicopter exposure at South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not store the budget records for presidential flights and the exact costs in connection with the overview are difficult to determine, according to the Navy's statement.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the refunds of the expenditure for VH-3D $24 380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate the time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are significantly lower than that amount.
"To impose taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for expenditure refunds is very fraudulent," Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, the refunds of DoD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
Sean Spicer, the press secretary of the White House, defended the use of helicopters for the purpose of viewing.
"The idea of overviews that will take place this week is to present products produced in the United States," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide work to hundreds of people, not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, in which the number of American citizens is not involved.
This fact should be recalled.”
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his tour at South Lawn. It's certainly possible to say only that he sat behind the wheel of one of the hashish cars.
Back in the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky’s representative and laughed at the media about his own fleet of products.
“I know very well,” said the president, “I have only three of my own right now.”
A young woman was tied up in the box at the Lake Macho, and the police went to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2 p.m.
Instead of swimming, she remained imprisoned in urine.
When she decided to ask for help from the police, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, police soon lost contact with her," police spokesman Ivana Balakov said.
A number of police guards came out to the place she described, but finding a young woman wasn’t easy at all.
"Some of the police had to sail with rabbit mosquitoes hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground under their feet again," Balak said.
Likewise, she was missing.
Police urged on what direction she called for help.
"In order not to get this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would be able to calculate loudly," the spokesman said.
Police found a woman at 3 a.m. to 5 in the basements in Borný.
She was on the edge of physical and mental forces and showed signs of cooling.
That's why she was transferred to a Czecholypi hospital.
The connection of Grandpa with STAN?
From the desired bride, she becomes a sales girl.
That's a little irony.
In his web project searchesmeslusny.cz, as if a billionaire were actually telling voters that STAN suffered from a deficit of decent people.
He also argued that the political unfair party rather less known mayors and independents, in fact, does not have a national programme for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate will become a decent person, no matter what political opinion he has.
It was like this when Vit Bart started, and it wasn't really good.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some mayors, which Gazdík also admitted, and the popular argument of the chief of STAN disturbs, that the highest value of the movement is political verification and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to surveys.
They are now quietly replaced rapidly collected unknown personalities.
The total separation with people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on people’s candidates.
But if the STAN of identity suspected only a few at that time, then after Grandpa's arrival, only the game of identity ends.
Not only did Gazdík long limit himself to ANO Andreje Babishe, but Grandpa, who publicly praises Babishe, stated: "My goal is to move ANO, so the Movement of the Oldest gained 20 percent in the upcoming elections."
Hopefully he didn't move.
The grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and the billionaire is certainly not by accident.
It often speaks about politics like Babiš, but it does not build its own political mark.
STAN has for some time recalled reality show rather than a real political party, and Grandpa’s helping hand is as if she had made a more retail girl from her desired bride.
For some time, STAN went with TOP 09, then with people and now looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone's calling.
Police dogs exercised flying in the Bridge with a helicopter
Dogs specialized in the search of explosives and searching dogs today trained overflows at Lake Bridge with a helicopter.
The police dog should not be frightened and fearful of flying, said the police cynologist leader of the Usteckie region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At the Bridge, both adult dogs and those who are only going through training.
In addition to the standard training, where they had to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
In order to immediately reach the helicopter, the dog can go to work so that there is no problem with the helicopter's path.
"Today's helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog who is uncomfortable or is unable to start working immediately after a helicopter is removed from the training.
"Most of them, for example, are left in the garden," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Usteck region.
They dominate German shepherds, but also the Belgian shepherds.
The song takes care of him from the dog.
"He himself raises it, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Thomas added.
The animal is undergoing repeated veterinary examinations that can reveal any medical hygiene.
If the dog is healthy and unfair, it will perform the first tests in 20 months.
"It's about two-and-three years of intense intervention," Thomas added.
The length of service at the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve within eight to ten years.
They are mostly experienced with their dogs.
Trailer for Season 3 Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the middle of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the murderer of Pabl Escobar was discovered, Netflix series is far off.
The streaming service’s confirmation has already expired in the third and fourth season - the first nomination has already expired in the first trailer and the number of other negative characters.
In the third season, DEA will focus on the richest drug card in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential kmms, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company”, only with the difference that they graduate violent acts and payments of more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cardinal, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a verbal character of American and Colombian rights defenders in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will rebuild its premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan Democracy Relys on Women in Politics
Elections may be credible only if all members of the companies, including women, participate in, were announced on Wednesday by the UN Representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistant Mission, said the elections in the local representatives took part in hundreds of women, three women voted as Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in his Wednesday statement.
Elections can be fully representative and reliable only if women are involved, as well as all related processes related to the elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has revealed several threats to the electoral process that moves international combat activities to the second rail.
For the first time in this year’s elections, one democratically elected government is transferring its power to the peaceful next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission said that from a total of 3.6 million registered voters, there are 1.2 million women.
The unique beer is cooking again.
Good beer to a resurrected beer.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of a beer in Lobči at Mšena.
The beer, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century was reconstructed for a parochial operation.
She followed the years of bloom when the beer was famous mainly for dark beer.
Unfortunately, the production of World War II was stopped and in 1984 beer was internationalized.
Since then, the building has been serving a state ship.
The work of the destruction was perfected by beer owners after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and divided into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes were created in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavla Prouzovi.
They started repairing buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They are carefully dedicated and dedicated to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
Beverage has the same shape as in the nineteenth century when its golden age began.
Their work was awarded by the beer declaration for cultural monuments by the Ministry of Culture and construction became part of the European roads to industrial heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of beer was restored.
To taste a great lobeca beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokorinska, visit the pivotal area of beer.
When cooking beer, they use coconut water that comes from the protected landscape, salt from the lobeca fields and jate chmel.
You taste a traditional lightweight bed, as well as dark beer and specialties.
Don’t miss the examination of beer or beer on Saturday or afternoon or half the second.
The largest shooter in Czechoslovakia?
One of the greatest strengths of its kind in the world?
This unique building should have been Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žaclér, at the top of the territory cemetery above the village of Babí.
It originally had to be composed of up to twelve bunkers combined with wide underground.
There should have been commands, cabins, munitions warehouses, materials, electricity stations, machinery and hospitals.
The construction of the Munich Agreement has ended.
In less than a year, one powerful iron-beton bunker was built and underground spaces were expelled.
Thanks to Stachelberg’s enthusiasts who began reconstructing a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
Underground is already available from 75%!
In addition to the pedestrian T-S 73, there is also an exhibit and underground armed facility of lightweight fortification, there are also two pedestrian screws, cliffs and the learning path of Ovenné Trutnovsko.
Purification, cozy altar and stunning views of the landscape guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed next to monuments such as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrod.
The monastery of Chotešov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which is now mostly a huge four-cloud convention building over the beautiful garden.
The list he came to, but unfortunately, belongs to the unique buildings that threaten the destruction.
Indigenous people don’t want to give up, and for the support of the monastery, there are many events.
One of them is the next year's evening for Chotezhov monastery this Saturday of Fifth August, where I will go out. Vladimír Mišik, Ivan Hlas, will see the army exhibition and you will look at the places of beautiful vast buildings, which are usually unaccessible.
You will mostly enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look at the Neanderthals in your face?
The exhibition welcomes the Neandertals in the pavillion of the Anthropos Moravsky Earth Museum in Brno on an unexpected excursion into the deepest ancient times, into the world of our forefathers.
You will find out how Neandertals have perfectly managed to cope with the various extreme climate conditions, mainly by changing ice and intermittent times.
Despite their simple material culture, they were extremely successful predators of their time.
You will also learn how they looked like their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind, but also their aesthetic feelings.
You wouldn't say that to the Neanderthals?
Let me convince you in Brno.
The 14th festival of KELT & WORLD MUSIC takes place on Saturday, on the 5th of Veveří Castle.
In addition to great music, you will see the construction of a Celtic village, you will try the Celtic lifestyle, including turkeys, games for children and adults, imprisonment, magic or ritual painting on the body.
La Quadrilla will not be missing with Irish and Scottish dances, bubbles, dudes game and amazing fire surprises in giving Carpe Night.
How tasteful is Moravskoslezsko?
The seventh anniversary of the famous gastrofestival How taste Moravskoslezsko takes place on Saturday, August 5, 2017 in the mountainous bath area of Karlova Studánka.
The chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, taste culinary specialities and regional foods, enjoy music and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, jumping castle, Smouli competition roads and, of course, a variety of competitions.
Know the plant with a single click.
The new free Pl@ntNet app will help students with the creation of tea and ordinary plant lovers.
When they are interested in what plant they’ve just touched on walking, these apps will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is photograph the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind of type it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented to representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethics and Environmental Education in the Bratislava Mountain Park as part of the Project Secret Life of the City on Tuesday.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed with teachers in the application database and added plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to contribute as many people as possible to the application of their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the applications can recognize.
“Your children who hold tablets or mobiles in their hands can go to the forest,” said Ivan Poláčkova, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently quality photography of the flower, leave or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which is then assigned under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech in the Secret Life of the City project.
Therefore, it is welcome that users, after creating an account, contribute to the application with an image of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"Francouz will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Polish said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require that McVitie's dryers’ managers ensure the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that the company is still silent about potential investment in the Tollcross factory.
In the factory, more than 500 employees are employed, producing other products as well as Hobnob and Rich Tea sushi.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and representatives of the trade unions will be “among the first informed” in the event of changes in the factory’s operation.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB trade unions expressed their concern that McVitie's would “not have enough of its promises to finance and modernize production lines.”
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we had no clear responses by the builder on the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very concerned for our members.
They worked here a generation of families and employees come mostly from the local community and Glasgow area, where work in this factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising life costs and slow production – the east part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
Pladis spokeswoman said: “The founder Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday, and the company will make a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade representatives.
A regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and a lot of issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we value our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all of our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
“In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in Tollcross, especially in production lines and efficiency.
We appreciate the legacy of Tollcross and its locations, and in the event of any changes in operation of the factory here, employees and representatives of the unions will be immediately informed."
Did PSG warn Barcelona to move Neymara three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow to gain Neymar on its side after it made £ 189 million, i.e. the amount needed to buy Neymar from the contract, but this French team warned Barcelona about his record arrival three years ago?
Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid him £89 million last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - by taxation, the PSG will take over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is enraged in the way Neymar made his contract, despite the confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in preventing one of the best players in PSG.
“I’m not afraid, because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll definitely talk to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed the intentional border when it expressed interest in PSG backup Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG has clearly expressed itself in the sense that under no circumstances it will allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona, for its troubling negotiations with Neymara, will now pollute the burnt pill.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have a widespread understanding of rules?
Donald Trump pleaded for anti-Russian sanctions.
The U.S. has previously imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And even a day earlier, Trump wrote that China wouldn’t do anything to North Korea’s threat and that it wouldn’t go on.
And that's a clear idea of sanctions as a shoe slaughter.
These things can't be thrown into one pillow.
Madurova Venezuela really went on the way to the dictatorship, but totally.
China is just doing what the U.S. president wants.
Russia is the chapter for itself.
But if anyone wants to summarize all of this so that even the ordinary voters, American, European or other, understand what is based on and what rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only demanding what President Obama has already ordered, just giving this a executive strike.
So why is that a break?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US elections, he will join Putin and revoke the sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is vice versa.
With Trump, the penalties are uncomfortable, unless they are uncomfortable.
Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zypries said Trump’s sanctions violated international law.
Just like basketball are sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But there are neither baskets nor anti-Russian sanctions in the EU.
European Commission Chief Juncker again complains that Trump’s sanctions are threatening EU energy security.
As if the sanctions were used so weak that they wouldn’t threaten anyone?
Regular tab voter.
For three years, he has heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of Minsk settlement agreements on Ukraine.
It is now apparent that it is the EU’s energy security.
Election of tapes and more widespread.
In Russia there are sanctions because it is too laid down where it is not.
China is deemed to have a little installed.
The Venezuelan president is punished for building a dictatorship on the borders of his country.
All these penalties or just considerations have their own rationality.
But do you see a system, rules, or rules?
Andrej Babiš: I don't think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the Republic with his visionary book and finalized the election program.
In addition to the Pardubian country, all candidates are already ready.
According to his words, he did not intervene significantly in them.
He even agreed to be led by Moravskoskoslezska heightman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if it succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a heightener," Babiš confirmed his previous opinion.
You are angry with a lot of representatives and national politicians that direct elections of mayors and prime ministers should manage municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
You mean that seriously?
It wasn't.
I am an advocate for direct democracy, we are electing directly to the President, and I am convinced that we should also elect the mayors and primates.
In my book I don't talk about the disruption of representatives, they can be there quietly.
The question is how many of them will be.
In the presentation of your book about what I dream, when I accidentally sleep, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about the cancellation of representatives.
You don't remember that.
I talked about the direct election and the reduction of the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister is calculated that little is building and hasn't prepared big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman, led.
I don't say they did it well.
The current Prime Minister does not control anything, he just moderates the debate.
So it can't work.
That’s why you want to use the majority system?
It'd be perfect, but it's hard to win.
We only have a change in the one-cycle election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a delegate mandate of the Ministers and an amendment of the Parliament's agenda to prevent the unnecessary exhibits of Members, who must work mainly in committees and committees, from being presented at the meetings of the Parliament.
It is definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
That's exactly what your opponents are afraid.
As a dictator, you will control the government, control the parliament with 101 Members, cancel the country and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and prime ministers, you will control the whole country.
Well, that's definitely not.
There is nothing wrong with the debate on the number of Members.
France’s President Macron announced a third reduction in the Legislative Assembly, while there are 57,000 French in one legislature, and 17,000 Czech in us.
However, no one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone won the elections in the Czech Republic mostly, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
The lines for those who have a parliamentary majority are large, but it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like this in the case of the movement will be threatened.
We just need a team to work in the government for people, not for their basements or resorts.
I don’t understand why we have failed to agree that only the wages of teachers, employees in culture and social services will be increased.
Why were I voted over and added to 21 percent of the GIBS members who are now taking 60 thousand?
Would you like to get this as a Prime Minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave independently, pledge the government with the travel offices and would like to deal with the money of the state as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers should not argue in the government, the disputes should come out of it.
The cabinet must go to the finished material, in which there is no room for coalition breaks, power voting and chefts, there should be a decision.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers behave mainly side-by-side?
There is a constitutional law on the sides.
When the bread came to the table, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement was not valid, and Babishe threw out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
However, if it is a personality and has management capabilities, a similar gesture plan does not need.
It measures all the same and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we're probably not going to be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so horrible.
There isn't so much skepticism in place.
Oldest entrepreneurs have acquired Grandpa, who would like to work with you, with people, may win the wings of the eager Jiří Čunka to you.
I don't think that.
The Czech Republic leads Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with ANO, in the ODS may be gained by Václav Klaus ml., which will also not be opposed.
I would leave it on voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President Richard Brabec said you have a lot of common points with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamurovs are considered a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his own political history, nominated as a Vito Bárty for VV, then earned money from Úsvitu for his company, carried out a shot there.
He is, of course, a significant personality.
But it's a little bit naked.
When I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you about it at all.
I wonder if you are an acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions speaking on demonstrations with chibenics and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about cooperation with Mr. Okamury's side, I can't imagine it.
It is obvious that he went to politics to benefit from it.
What does the support of the Communists of your minority government do?
I can't imagine it, but it's the choice of voters.
It will be negotiating with another in order, but God knows who will win and who will be two.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your effort to become a company.
But the government has just to rule, the Prime Minister Sobotka had allowed everything to avoid, never decided.
Coalition issues such as ČEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his loft, and I think it was also the reason he threw me out.
As soon as he did this, the Czech government ruled.
However, it is incredible that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ management, which stores the Finance Minister on how to vote for the General Assembly ČEZ.
If you become the Prime Minister, will you change your personal conditions in the supervisory board and exchange the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm the Prime Minister, I'll see you.
I'm not yet.
I am surprised that the TZZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the Czechoslovakia would like to exchange for even better with YES.
After the elections, everything will continue.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any lobbist of the Humble or Rose, I'm a separate unit and I can't solve this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you are headed by the government, are you trying to exchange the leadership of the Czech TV or the general health insurance company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like to be a transparency society.
He has done what he wanted for years, thanks to the commission for traditional political parties.
It is enough to monitor Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in the CHEZ, it has never controlled it, it was just a number there, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CHEZ should take Dukovany, evaluate them, put them into the subsidiary of the company, organize funding, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state has to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her orders against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't have and I won't have any competence to expel anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I’m just saying that citizens pay approximately 7.2 billion per year for public radio and television fees, but they don’t actually know how these institutions will manage.
How do they not know?
The House, however, approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the Chief Executives and Chief Executives.
See how these reports are discussed on the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary committee for escape from investigation letters and to the lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalouska push me out of the government, which earned the TOP 09 percent, but the Czech Republic took it off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they are talking about threatening Babiš democracy.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power background by reaching his son to the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and establishing agreements to the associate lawyer of Flowerslava Hlín with urban and state companies, such as Prague Transport and Czech Company?
We have a permanent dispute in that.
I don't like it, and I've read it several times.
Faltynek argues that the said lawyer is working at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a minister of finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, no Kratochville, no March.
If there was any sign of a client, we immediately expelled such a person.
I am uncompromising in this direction.
If something like that happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it would be.
