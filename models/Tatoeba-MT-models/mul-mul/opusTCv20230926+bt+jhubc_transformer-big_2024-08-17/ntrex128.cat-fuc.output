Members of the Assembly of Galles concerned for "Identify them as Muppets"
MEPs of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Deputy of the Galles Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament) (MEPs of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has emerged from the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Galles Parliament.
Members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concerns that this measure may become a motive of ridicule.
A member of the Worker Party Assembly said that his party was concerned about the fact that MWP "remained with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who don't read galles: In galles, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Pleasant Cymru Party Assembly commented that the set of his party "not see it with good eyes" and proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Conservative Member of Galles stated that his group was "open" before the change of name, but also commented that there is too small difference between terms "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it is necessary to say that the letter "w" in galles is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in English in Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for the elaboration of the legal elimination to introduce name change: "The final decision on any qualifying to appoint Members of the assembly will take naturally into their own members."
The Law of the 2017 Government of Gal·les gives the Assembly of Gal·les all power to change its name.
In June, Committee publicated the results of a public consultation on the proposals of the proposals, with a wide support for the proposal for a change of the name of the assembly by the Gallien Parliament of the Gallien Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was deported by "Members of the Galles parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" is the one who received a wider support for public consultation.
Imaginable, members of the assembly propose different alternatives. However, the intent to achieve a consensus can suppose a whole maldecap for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who expects to present legal elimination on changes in question of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes relating to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the dequalification of its members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the assembly shall hold definitive vote on their name during the debate relating to legislation.

The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, protested against the Macedonian people, saying that the change of name was made, and he said that he wouldn't vote for them.
However, those who are favored, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that change of names is simply the price that must be paid to become member of EU and NATO.

In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when the fans of reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, it was then when they charged the carrillo.
The reverend David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's Church, described him all proudly as "The Camps of the Poor People's Camps".
The expert who made the carrillo sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, observed also that it was the world's first carrillo that was played by a black race musician Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest carrillo of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's's was not replaced him.
What's sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them are carried by laic leaders of the church and some by the episcopal diocese.

He jokeed for the possible criticism he received by media to make a comment that some would consider "pop of a president" and to have so positive opinion of North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, all making joke about the to voice of a reporter:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in celebrating a second meeting after the first celebration in Singapore in June was declared a big step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are found intact.
"More than three months after summit celebrated in June in Singapore, high diplomatic North Korean Ri Yong Yong Ho commented Saturday to the leaders of the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea does not see a "responsive in correspondence" by US on the first initiatives of disarmament made by their country.
However, he noted, the US continues to implement sanctions with the goal of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s opinion, in turn, was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing it very well with North Korea," he said.
"Vi erklærte krig mot Nord-Korea.
Mill Mill Mill Mill Mill Mill millions would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would would.. would would would would would... millions millions millions millions would would would would would would would would
And now let’s keep this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end tests with missiles, help release hosts and return home from remains of American soldiers.

"Ene isle destroyed and hundreds of dead because of tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia."
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, it was said to non-governmental organizations of other countries that were not needed.
Although more than 10 % of Lombok population had to be displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite to be able to catalyze international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they've made it very clear that they're not demanding international assistance, so that the situation is very demanding," comments Mrs Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it's not sure that foreigners can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, portar of the National Disaster Agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were evaluating situation in Palu to see whether it is permissible or not international agency to contribute to the time of offering assistance.
Donated by the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country continues to be unprepared to the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has built refuges in the case of tsunami, they are not often at other cost.
The seemingly lack of alerted syrenes in Palu in case of tsunami, although there was a warning in force, it is very likely that it has contributed to the number of deaths.
In the best of cases, to move between the vast amount of islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natur catastrophes are even more complicated by logistics.

President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his electoral campaign the improvement of Indonesia's malnutrition infrastructure, and has invested enormous amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko’s government is confronted with the year coming to re-election loaded financial deficits.
Joko also faces the pressure of the permanent sectarian tensions of the country, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative faith of falling.

The Tir crossed the whole area with a great elevation while he was walking to the right of the gate.
The ball finally started descending over a full-scale Kepa Arrizabalaga jumping to try to stop it and ended at the bottom of the network.

Cromwell's Statue of British Parliament became the last monument affected by debate around "rewriting history"
Their disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the destruction of the purest style of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects of England, perpetred by their fanatic puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "boy" and a "intent of rewriting history".

The iconoclasticity of the English Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, which he did in the preceding century.
Cromwell's magnificent representation by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe that it is worthy to be commemorated.

Whether this is a fact or not a totally accupied representation is a topic of historic debate.
What is true is that the conflict of medievals of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognized figure representing a base of this division.
"His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A pig kidnapped dead a chineese grandma
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pork in a market in southwest China, according to local sources.
The man, identified only by his name Yuan, was found dead with a cut artery and all blood covered near a pork court in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a swine farmer was preparing to inject vaccines to swine in a courtyard in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
On the other hand, she traveled Wednesday with her cowboy from Yunnan Province neighborhood to sell 15 pigs on the market.
And the next morning, when he was dead, he found a door open, which was given to a pork's tent.

The forensic examination confirmed that the garrier of 250 kg had wounded the granger's death, according to the report.
"My feet were destroyed and full of blood", he said, "Wu", according to the news of Guiyang's vessel.
The scenes recorded for the security camera show how Yuan enters the market at 4:40 pm Thursday morning to feed pigs.

The animal, who killed a man, was neither Yuan nor his own.
One of the market officials commented to the news of the evening that the pork stayed closed and isolated to avoid attacking anyone else, while police gather tests at the scene of crime.
According to the report, Yuan family and market managers are trading a compensation for their death.
Although very rare, have previously been reported cases of pigs that attacke humans.
In 2016, a pork attacked a woman and her husband at his farm in Massachusetts, and left him with severe wounds.
A few years ago, a pork of almost 300 kg grabbed a galles farmer against his tractor until his wife could scare the animal.
After a granger of Oregon was destroyed by his pigs in 2012, a granger of Manitoba told CBC news that pigs usually aren't aggressive, but that blood gustos may act as "decadenant".
"They liked to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they're not going to do wrong.

In October there will be several important temperature variations for all the USA as the Arctic is cooled, although the tropicals will remain very hot.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic temperature changes in a short distance.
The U.S. center region on Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have been recorded.
In the coming days, the persistent heat of summer will try to expand again.
It is predicted that the month of October will begin with heat in large part of the central and east zone of the US, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the area of the South Planets to the northeast parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term forecast, there are many possibilities that temperatures are recorded over the middle east of the USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the passionate witness of the candidate member of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which presumably took place in the 80s Christine Blasey Ford. The witness was transmitted to six different TV chains.
Meanwhile, the political impetus continued, with the broadcasters discontinued the usual programming of Friday due to a rotation of events in the last minute: an agreement designed by senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a survey of offices for a week.
Ford explained to Senate Committee for Judicial Affairs that was totally convinced that Kavanaugh touched her drunk and tried to pull her out her clothes in a party of institute party.
Kavanaugh, in a false witness, said that he was absolutely convinced that this was not happening.
According to Nielsen, it's likely that more than 20,4 million viewers saw this witness Friday.
The company accounted for median viewers of chains CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The auditions numbers were not available instantly by other chains that transmitted the witness, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen often has problems calculating the people you see from his office.
Posed in perspective, it is a audience similar to a game of American football playoffs or that of the Oscar ceremony.

The ABC was the second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS achieved 3,1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million, and CNN 2,52 million, according to Nielsen's data.
The interests remained high after the testimony.
Flake was the main figure of Friday's drama.
After a moderate republican office issued a statement saying they would vote for Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning while incremented by protesters as he attempted to ascend a elevator to go to a view of the Committee on Judicial Affairs.
Flake stayed several minutes with ablated view while he was live TV TV in CNN.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Flake said that her office had issued a message and, before she closed the doors of the elevator, she commented that she would have more to say to the committee's vision.

Flake said, in exchange, that he would only do that by understanding that FBI would investigate the allegations against the face appointment to the next week, condition required by minority democrats.
Flake was convinced in part thanks to the conversations she kept with her friend, Christ Coons, Democratic Senator.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake took his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, since it was evident that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened FBI investigations for allegations against Kavanaugh.

Menga plays give Livingston win for 1 to 0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston assumed victory
The Livingston, which this year had risen in category, surprised Glasgow Rangers in which everything just is Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as coach of Ibrox district club club.
Dolly Menga's game marked the difference, since, with this victory, Gary Holt's team up to the second position, which shared with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's guys, in exchange, continue without gaining out of house in Premiership this season. Next Sunday they'll meet the leader, the Hearts, with which they separate a difference of eight points.
But before that, Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna in the European League Thursday.
The Livingston, while the Livingston, wide up to six games his invisible race in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what is the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston doesn't take advantage of its opportunities before the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the marker long before the goal, since his direct game provoked all kinds of problems in Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened the way between the defense, but he defeated his occasion when he found him before the gateway. Then Alan Lithgow sent out the ball to get rid of trying to finish the head pass Craig Halkett, who crossed the gateway.
Among the locals, the Rangers were well let them go to their area, because they knew they could put the visitors in trouble when they played isolated games.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The arbiter defeated a lack of interests against Rangers and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could touch it first and end it from the central part of the area.
Until that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but he found himself with an impenetrable defense and a porter Liam Kelly who had very little job throughout the match,
The scenario was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
Porter of Rangers Allan McGregor stopped with his feet once Scott Pittman and Lithgow finished deviating another game of combination of Livingston.
The Rangers devoted himself to plunge once and another pilots in the area of Livingston, only to be rejected. Plus, they were claiming two penalties, one for supposed input of Halkett to Glenn Middleton replacement, and another for hand. Both were denied.
Livingston "Fenomenal": Analysis
Alasdair Lamont de BBC Scotland Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great results for Livingston.
A man thinks they've been excellent, and continue to overcome all expectations in this ascending path.
The game style of his gameplay and staff have almost not changed from his return to the maximum category category, though much of the measurement must be awarded Holt Holt for the way that he has galvanized the team from his arrival.
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Kapitein Halkett was immense, head of a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were obliged to be Menga's pendents throughout the match.
The Rangers didn't have any inspiration.
Although brilliant moments exhibited with Gerrard as a coach, definitivamente they didn't know to keep the level.
They didn't know how they created occasions (sometimes they crossed the local defense clearly), and that's the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.

US should duplicate funds destined for IA
"As China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, USA should double the amount of money they spend in research in this field," says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and specialist in artificial intelligence who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the US Government have announced measures in the field of IA, though there is general lack of formal strategy in IA in the country.
China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number 1 in the world in terms of innovation in IA in 2030.

"Duplication of financing could duplicate the chances that USA achieve the next great discovery in IA", Lee CNBC said in an interview this week.
Lee Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in Face++, one of China's most prominent IT companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a IA system that overcame the American player of Othello with the best ranking and subsequently exercised as executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch office of Google.
Lee appreciated positively previous technological competitions from the U.S. Government, such as Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defence Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when it would take place next to identify the next visionary.
"Softly, American researchers must work hard to get public scholarships," Lee said.
According to Lee, "China isn't the one who wins academic leaders; they're the companies."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have contracted university excellence to work in the field of IA.
Lee commented that the US task in the field of IA could also be seen driven with changes in imigration policy.
"I think they should offer automatically permanent residence cards to doctorands in IA", he added.
In July 2017, China State Council introduced its Plan of Artificial Intelligence Intelligence Development Plan of last generation.
"The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China awards funds to people from academic institutions in the same way as the Foundation of Natural Sciences and other public organizations of the United States give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than China," Lee noted.
Initial of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States, Department of Defense of the United States, initial of the year, the Department of Defense of the United States created a Centre for Common Artificial Intelligence, Designed for Participation of Collaborators of Industry Industry and Academical Institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a Selected Selected Committee of Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month, DARPA announced a $2,000 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the Foundation of Natural Sciences, currently allocated more than 100 million USD per year to research in IA.
In the meantime, months ago, there is no measure in relation to the American law that claims to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.

Trump sets a comment in Virginia de West
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his candidate for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the participation of Republicans in half-mandate elections.
“Everything we did was played in November.
It's 5 weeks for one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the great, big.. I don't see myself, but in reality I see myself. That's why I'm fighting for fantastic candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You can see this horrible, horrible group of democrats, this is going through right now.
They are determined to obtain the power of all the necessary means, according to their own purpose.
non non non non non non non non non non non non
“Democratic mission,” he said, “is “restauration and obstruction”.
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he replyed, and he titled demócrates of "arrogant, like arrogant, cruel, and false."
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, senior Democratic senator of the Senate Judicial Committee of the Senate, making it provoked a strong written written by public.

No, oh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad expression of body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party must stop being a different party.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists of my local partition voted to censorate me, it didn't surprise me.
I am the last of a series of british parliamentarians who said to us that we are not welcomed, all that we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because he manifested himself decisively against antisemitism.
In my case, with the motions of censorship, I was criticized for disputing with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of an economic policy responsible, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, they are similar issues concerning which Jeremy disputed with previous leaders.
In a notification of the meeting of the Nottingham Laborist Partist Party on Friday, it was notified that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as local laborist parliamentary, meetings of the General Committee held Friday night and night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and for a long time it has forgotten the promise of policies "more generous and kindly" if it is that some time has existed.
"It is un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un un
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought that he shared a political vision seemed to expect me to make a 180° rotation and taking positions I would never have taken, whether on national security or on EU EU single market.
"Always when I speak publicly, say what you say, social media are filled with agressive messages, in which a call is made for not to renew my candidature, they declare central policy and they say that I should not be in the Laborist Party.
And that’s not only mine.
I know that some of my colleagues and colleagues are more grateful than those of my colleagues and colleagues.
I'm impressed by the professionality and determination of colleagues that every day they must face a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and they won't come.
One of the most deceiving aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
Reality is that we're no longer that party so diverse, and with every motion of "unconfidence" or any change in the standard of selection, the party is more stringed out.
In the last two years, I have received many tips, and they have recommended me that you keep your head down, that you weren’t so expressive and ‘all would come well’.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my era of study, stimulated by the negligent government of Thatcher, who left all my class literally infunded, I tried to defend better public services for those who need it, both as a local consultant or as a minister of government.
I've never hid my politics or even in the last elections.
Nobody in Nottingham East would not doubt any way about my political positions and points of disagreement with the current direction.
“At those who promoted motif Friday, I would say to them that in a moment when the country walks towards a Brexit that will harm homes, corporations and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message that I want to transmit was not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are or not working members, or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise you, that no threat of not renewal of my candidature or political interests will prevent it from being present, according to my opinion, in all interests of you, in favor of all interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: uns imbatuts Ayr lider lider
Two last hour tests distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayrs won the victory in this vibrant match of the day of Tennent's Premiership.
The Ayrs, who are the only team imbatut of the 10, occupe the first position in the classification table.
Ultimately, the local team imposed thanks to his defensive superiority and the fact that he learned to benefit better from the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
"The matches that we've played so far have tested us, and we're still intact, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, desiring: “Hello, Ayr, you’ve enjoyed better times than us.”
Grant Anderson's trial at the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed before the Ayrs, but a groga card for the international Scottish Rory Hughes, ceded for the match by Warriors, allowed Melrose's to take advantage of numeric superiority and Jason Baggot noted an unconverted trial.
Climo expanded the advantage of Ayrs with a sanction and, just a half part, noted and converted a test to place the marker 17-5 for Ayrs in the rest.
But the Melrose started well the second part, and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced differences to five points.
Afterwards, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury that Ruaridh Knott suffered, which retired in literature, and the Ayrs resumed again expanded the distance with a Stafford McDowall assault converted to Climo.
Afterwards, supplent captain Blair Macpherson was amonested with a grog card and, again, Melrose's exploited superiority of another man with a non-converted test from Bruce Colvine at the end of moments of forceful pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw grog card to make a placement in Climo unballless, since the sanction line-up, MacPherson noted a counterassay behind the penetrant moll of Ayrs.
Climo marked, as he had done it again almost since the reprise, after Kyle Rowe picked up a dog from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line line Gregor Henry to notate the fifth assault of the local team.

“Recuperation is a duty.”
Arreu from the non-Bolivia coastal territory, the memory of a lost coast before Chile in a cruel resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as it is the angel of returning to sealing through the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may be the most profound in decades, while Bolivia expects the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has impuls, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, it is not necessary to say, esperanting positive positividad result", claimed Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A lot of Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on large screens across the country, with hope that La Haia Court dictate in favor of Bolivia claim that, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate concession of a submarine exit submarine mare to sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for reelection next year, also has many hopes deposited in the resolution of Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analists think it's unlikely that Court decide favor Bolivia, and that, if he does so, the matters wouldn't change much.
The United Nations organization based on the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilen territory and has established that it will not determine the result of possible conversations.
The TIJ resolution, which occurs only six months after the final allegations, indicates that the case “non was complicated,” said Paz Zárate, Chilean specialist in international law.
I'm far from seeing favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a retrocedent in the last four years.
"The current boliviana administration has secreted the issue of access to the sea", he said.

Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk for a while, but it will be very difficult to keep talks after this episode.

North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless you can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if he cannot trust Washington.
It was discussed Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit celebrated in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements arrive at a time when it appears that US secretary of state Mike Pompeo is about to resumer nuclear diplomacy extended more than three months after summit celebrated in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
He laughs that it's a chimera to think that the continued sanctions and the US' opposition to a statement that ends the Korean War may make North Korea ever climb.
Washington desconfies to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not do important disarmament movements before.
Kim and President. American Donald Trump wants to celebrate a second summit.
However, there is a generalized skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang takes seriously the question of abandoning an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion defilades reveal the latest range of large-scale barrels, from a road to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your collection of barrels or want to completely protect yourself from sun, you don't need to look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagant strings of disproportionate dimensions of their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been swallowed by very low-practice barrels, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the gateway.
Valentino's outstanding piece was an exaggerated beige bar, decorated with a wide wings, with a shape of plume, which flood the head of the models.
Among other extra sized accessories, there were beaten shells, a barbecue of brush and even a pink, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of maskers, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the maskers, colors live, had lips bodyed and seemed more like Hanniball Lecter than not high-coating.
One creature was assembled to a whole submarine team, with tubes and glasses, while another was like a glacier.
And if you follow the great trends of fashion, you're lucky.
Stil observers predict that the enormous bars could place themselves in the main streets near you.
The large-scale barbers trigger the talons of the "Bomba", a ball barber, with anchor wide of two feet, which everybody has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind so little practice that was scamed through social networks brought another great creation to the pastel: a ball sack for the beach, almost as large as the model dressed with bathman that carried him.
The raffia sack, dark purple color, decorated with raffia serrells and finished with a white leather nans, was the highlight piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 at the Paris Fashion Week.

John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland independent Schools of Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence academic excellence which has continued 2018 2018 with another series of excellent excellent examination results, which is strengthened with individual and collective success in individual and collective success in sport, art, art, art, music, music and other community community efforts and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) are striving to provide best-level service for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for postgraduate and superior studies, for the race they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we observe that modern languages continue to be a very popular and desired choice matter at schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language you understand, you'll get to his head.
“If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we can't depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the year exam, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages received A Higher rating.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS members schools, reflected that 72% of the students obtained A higher qualification in mandari, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support for foreign languages, such as vital competences vitales, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, the languages, as a assignment of choice, remain in the same consideration as STEM assignments (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) to study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Competitions revealed that because of the reasons entrepreneurs gave to the fact that they cost to cover vacation, 17% was assigned to lack of linguistic competence.
So, linguistic skills are increasingly indispensables to prepare young people for their future career.
Since every time there are more potential jobs opportunities that require languages, these competences are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what race a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competence like this.
The fact that the ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically place a multilingual person before competence.
According to a survey conducted in 2013 by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% couldn't speak a foreign language enough to keep a conversation, and French, with 15% speakers, was the only language with a double-digital percentage.
Because of this, investing in the teaching of languages is important for children today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children best opportunities to find important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity between schools in terms of languages that they learn.
Some schools are more focused on the most traditional modern languages, while some teach languages that are considered to be more important for UK face to face to face to future, until 2020, like mandarily or japanese.
You will always be able to choose from a series of languages in independent schools, with personal teacher expert in this field.
Scotland Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what happens in the future.
In the global trade environment of the current era, it is not possible to negate that languages continue to have vital importance for the future of the country, and that must reflecte in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communications competences".
Independent schools will continue offering this option, diversity and excellence to Scotland young people.
Dee, dee, dee.

The expectation has virtually ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game with Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, Lakers coach, announced that James will play Sunday the first pretemporary match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is necessary to determine what minutes it will play.
"They'll be more than one or less than 48," Walton told Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, Lakers Reporter, tweeted that James probably will play a few minutes.
After the beginnings of this week's training, James was asked about his plans for the calendar of six pre-season matches of Lakers.

Trump’s Miting in Virginia de l’Oest, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of campaign acts this night in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first five hadings planned for the next week, including visits to sympathetic sites, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the vacant of the Supreme Court is waiting, Trump intends to obtain support for the next half-mandate elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are issued in November.
What hour is Trump's Miting in West Virginia of this night and how can you see it online?
Trump's míting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19h today, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's míting in West Virginia can be seen online on the link specified below, through live video transmission by YouTube.
Trump is likely to address audition initiated this week with candidate nominated in Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense due to accusations of abuse sexual inconvenience, while Senate's confirmation planned vote remains waiting until a week and FBI investigate the case.
But the main objective of this wing is to help the Republicans who present themselves at the delicate elections of November to charge impulse.
So, the five twins of President Trump’s campaign planned for next week are aimed at “stimule volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans try to protect and expand majorities of their own in Senate and Chamber of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda, that President will travel to as many states as possible, while we are going to a season of a turbulent campaign", he noted Trump's spokesman, who refused to be identified, according to Reuters.
The míting of this night, programmed at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather sympathizers "f'Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the coverage of Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the first time Trump visit West Virginia, the state where he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate republican to the West Virginia Senate, which is getting negative results in surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that President must come to give him impuls in the investigations," commented Simon Haeder, politologue de University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: American team show their ambition to maintain live face hopes in individual Sunday matches
After three inequaliable sessions, Saturday foursomes in the afternoon probably were the one this Ryder Cup needed.
The basculant pedal of dynamics is a concept of sport invented, in which players really believe, especially in such competitions.
So, at what side do we find positive dynamics now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four, so I think we're in a small positive race," Jordan Spieth said while he marched at the end of the day.
Evidently, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with more than twelve in game.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that wind blows a little in his favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the state forming of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been fatale from tee to green and gives an example.
The gutural crusts of celebration ascended intense while he continued his rotation, and became a bit crucial to hit the fourth match, when he and Thomas were two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in the hole 15 with a similar crit, as he indicated that he believes that the American team is still out of the competition.
"Thank you to make your best and worry about your own partition," Spieth notes.
All this is what they are now playing.
18 holes to leave printed.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable sensation of Ryder Cup.
The stranger, but a delicious European couple, carry four four and do not make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only partner who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided a bogey Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last 9 holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way that his energy seems to flow to and out of the public bullying, it is reaffirmed that they are the players to battery Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victories while sunset on Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously in different holes.
Identifying Europe’s Glory seems to be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon ended with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs of the morning, who made a partner with Alex Noren.
The first one in Spain and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain, and the second one in Spain.
"But on Sundays, no one can help you out of the tomb.

Until now, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has demonstrated that the US team has motivated to fight that some, especially in the United States, were questioned.
Europe reaches the end of Ryder Cup with a favorable marker of 10-6
Europe will face the last day of Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing fourballs and foursomes Saturday with a victory of 10 to 6 over the United States.
The inspiration duo formated by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave his record, up to now, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who intended to preserve the trofee that lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated a US team uncertainly at the fourballs of the morning and placed the series in 3-1.

Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the 12 individual matches Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to achieve four consequential points, while he and Molinari, familiar with the name of "Molliwood" after a sensational week-end, are only the second couple who wins four points in his first four matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After slavering Woods and Patrick Reed to fourballs, they made a brilliant performance to overcome a Woods desinflation and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for a 5&4 even more emphatic.
Woods, who had been thrown into two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic geniality pursuits, but lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consequence.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in fourballs in the morning, regained a couple with Henrik Stenson in foursomes, and falled for 2 to 1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked as first and third in the world, respectively.
Europa, however, was not all faced in a nice and windy day to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three times champion of the tournament, and Justin Thomas established Saturday a reference point for Americans getting two points.
Ian Poulter, Jon Rahm, and Ian Poulter won fourballs, and later won Poulter, Rory McIlroy, 4 to 3 won foursomes, after they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup a team had restarted a difference of four points in individual matches, although Furyk's team, the defender of the title, just needs to empathize to preserve it.
However, after being the second better for two days, it seems like a Sunday counterattack is out of its range.
North Korea declares that it will not dearmad unilaterally "in any way" if not appreciated signs of trust
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs told the UN Saturday that the ongoing sanctions were intensifying their desconfidence in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not eliminate their nuclear weapons unilaterally in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told Annual General Assembly of World Organization that North Korea had taken "important good will measures" during the previous year, such as stop nuclear testing and missiles, demontage nuclear testing center and compromise's to not proliferate weapons and nuclear technology.
“No, we don’t see any response in consonant US,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in these circumstances, we will not start disarmament unilaterally in any way."
Although Ri resumed the well-known Korean complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to a "phase by phase" approach of desnuclearization whereby North Korea would be rewarded as the measures taken paulation, its statements seemed significant because it didn't refuse unilateral desnuclearization of full, as Pyongyang was already done in full.

North Korea has attempted to formally end Korea War 1950-53, but the United States have notified that before Pyongyang had to eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the severe international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"United States insiste on the first need to occur desnuclearization and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their goal coercitively, in addition to opposition to the "deklaration of end of war", he noted Ri.
"The sensation that sanctions will make us close to us is a kilometer of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are going to intensify our unreliable defiance.”
Ri did not mention plans to celebrate a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted the United Nations in the beginning of the week.
" " " " " " " " ": " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " [ ", " ", " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Korea Korea Korea South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea,,,,,,, South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,, Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Korea Korea Korea Korea,,,,, Korea,,,,,,, Korea,,,,, Korea Korea,,,,,,, Korea,,,, Korea,,,,,, Korea,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US US,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he maintained last year, when he stated at UN General Assembly that referring to the US territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump titles Kim de "Rocket Man" Kim in a suicide mission.
Enguany to the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that there is still much to be done and the sanctions must be maintained until North Korea is denuclearized.

Harvard Students do a course on the habits of rest
Enguany, a new course at Harvard University has allowed his students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat culture, increasingly expanded, to study throughout the night, stimulated by caffeine.
A academic observed that students from the number of universities or the world often are ignored by taking the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Son Medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which believes he is the first of his species in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after making a conversation about the impact that sound privation had in learning.
"At the end of the conversation," "At the end of the conversation, at the end of the conversation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"He said that no one ever told him about the importance of son, which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, it explains to students the basic concepts on how good sound habits improve academic and sport performance, in addition to general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the University, said that the University decided to introduce the course after knowing that some students suffered a severe sleep privation during the week.
The course, for an hour of duration, includes a series of interactive tasks.
"In one section there is a picture of a room room, where the students should click on cups of coffee, caffeine, shirts, shirts, bamboo and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects the performance of the sport in the sleepless sleep, and the importance of keeping a routine routine to sleep to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, cerebral vessels, depression and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that student’s behavior will not change instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as we believe that they have the right to know the effects they have for their health to smoke cigarettes,” professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride of staying awake all night still exists, he said, and he added that modern technology and growing pressure that students suffer make sleep privation become a problem ever-growing.
Asesure to enjoy a good quality sound for a long time long long long, it should be a "secret arm" of the students of the students for the fight against stress, stress, fatigue, and anxiety and anxiety, added, add, add, add, even, even to avoid gain gain weight weight, even to avoid gain gain gain weight, even to avoid gain gain gain weight, as the sound of the son of the pleasing place place the brain in the brain in the brain in in the way of disability and the way.
Raymond So, 19-year-old Californian who studied Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year in his first year in Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout campus.
The next step, as he expects, is to ask graduate students to conduct a similar study program before incorporating in the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students should take into account a alarm when they sleep and when they wake up, and to be aware of the adverse effects of the “blue light” that emit the electron screens and LED LED lamps, which can alter the harmonisation of the rhythm of circadia and sound.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal ends with Gerrard men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's desarticulart team for a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's house, which assumes another defeat out.
The Ibrox team sought to sum his first victory at home from the triumph of February 4 to 1 in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat to Gerrard in 18 matches as coach to leave his team at the derivative, 8 points from Hearts, imparable leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga notated gol seven minutes before half side, and never seemed like Rangers, missing inspiration, was ready to match the marker.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston puts to third place, back to Hibernian for a difference in goals.
And Rangers could face more difficulties later, since Calum Spence line judge needed medical attention for a head wound caused by an object that apparently laid off from the gradient.
Gerrard made eight changes according to the alineation that he hid the Ayrs in the semifinals of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went out with the same 11 header who started a point against Hearts last week. Segurly, he felt satisfied with the way his team, well organized, suffocated his rivals all the time.
Although Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have marked two minutes of gameplay, when Menga's first intervention left Scot Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midcampist went off and desprofited the great occasion.
A Keaghan Jacobs' defeat launch of contundents hit with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow only made a deviated right backwards.
The Rangers went to control, but they seemed to have gained hope in the third game.
Alfredo Morelos creded really that he should have had a penalty in the sign of 15 minutes, since he and Steven Lawless were arrested, but arbitr Steven Thomson ignored Colombian claims.
The Rangers only led two juts to porter the first part, but the first porter of the Ibrox, Liam Kelly, did not have any problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head coup and the delicate front Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Libyans in the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserve it only for their efforts.
The Rangers were not able to play with the game of Jacob.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher transferred the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained the calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard acted in the pause by changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent by Ryan Kent. The change had an impact practically immediate, since the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the impressive Kelly fled to blocking.
However, Livingstons continued to draw attention to visitors playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett doing long pastures, one retreat the other.
Holt band could have ceded the direction to the final stages, but McGregor continued to stop rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deviated moment from the core.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked big eyes.
Almanac: The Inventar of the Geiger of the Counter
I now a page of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and counting... the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a invention that ultimately gave place to the device we know as "Geiger Computer".
The counter Geiger, who is a pillar of science since then, also became a pillar of pop culture, like the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", played by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, some apparently failed vackers physicists:
" " "?"?"?" " "?"?"?"? " " "??"?"?"?"? " " "??"?"??????????????????????????????
Rogers: "He's a Geiger counter, that's used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
"When you put these headphones, you can listen to the effects of atoms that come from radioactivity to minerals."
Evans: "Oh, I'm sure he's running out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the rich person who brings his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" maligne cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and eliminate maligne cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize maligne cells as part of the treatment
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient and alter them to the laboratory
Can "se" a protein common to many cancers and then reinjection them
A test vaccine shows promiscuous results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with vaccine, who taught the immune system how to recognize maligne cells, observed that ovarian cancer that suffered for over 18 months.
The method implies the extraction of immune cells from a patient, alter them to laboratory to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and subsequently re-injection.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky, from National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland (USA), "The results that we got suggest that we have a promising vaccine."
Protein HER2 "favores growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar focalization consists of extracting immune cells from patients and "instructing" these cells to how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

HIV/AIDS: China announces an increase in cases by 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to healthcare agents.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 were declared 40,000 cases new.
The immense majority of cases are sexual transmission, unlike that which was past past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who resist HIV for this cause has decreased almost to zero, according to the statements of Chinese healthcare professionals at a conference in Yunnan province.
Annual year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
HIV transmission sexual is a serious problem for the LGBT community of China.

Maxine Waters negate that an employee has filtered data from senators of the Republican Party and demontaged "Dangerous false" and "conspiration teories"
U.S. representative Maxine Waters denounced the accusations according to which a member of his staff had posted personal information from three republican senators of U.S. Republicans on the pages of Wikipedia of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democratic claims that the demands were stimulated by critical and web sites of extreme right.
"Lies, lies, and more lies that can be misunderstood," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the information published contained the addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and published it by someone unknown in Capitoli during a session of Senate committee on complaints of sexual abuse against candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Information was filtered after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that IP address that identifies the source of publications was linked to Waters Office and that reveals information from a member of Waters staff, the Capitoli reported.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Member of my personal, identity, personal data, and security of which have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent claims, was not responsible in any way for this filtration of information.
This claim is totally false and pure invention."
Waters' declaration generated criticism on-line rapidly, including that of the ex-press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"Este retribution is full of indignation," scriba Fleischer.
"I think you don't have time to be a member of Congress.
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
E-mail: E-mail:
Nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei, nei,
"Du must keep calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of the democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of appearing too angry during Thursday session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who appeared to reject Waters in the mid-parlamentary elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"Importar, if it's true."
In his declaration, Waters said his office had warned the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent declarations.
"We will ensure that the criminals will be revealed, and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions, and that they will harm everybody and everybody of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spion Parodia
It's already tradition to search for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this repository of frankness of Johnny English's action-comédia parodia, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, it's not an exception.
Is this humoristic self-saturation about how we are misunderstood will be a new country export opportunity?
In any case, the inkompetent of outlet eye and face of gum Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to pull it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-english language language territories with tradition of going to cinema.
Obviously, it is the stupid secret agent that, in spite of his rare pretensions of glamour liquat, has a little Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that brings a single note to the theme of Fire Carros at the inaugural ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, it was based on international traveler and mysterious Atkinson who represented Barclaycard's now forgotten TV ads, where it was sealing chaos nearby.
There's one or two good times in this last trip of JE.
I liked Johnny English, who was approaching a helicopter dressed with a medieval armadura, and the shelves of the helicopter squeezed him in the cascade.
S's see what Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems fairly flowing and strangely overflowing, especially because "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now already include comedy as ingredient.
Humor seems to be intended for more than adults and for me, Johnny English's absurde adventures are not so incredible or focalized than the mute gags of Mr. Bean character representing Atkinson.
The premise of repeated local now is that UK is in serious problems.
A pirate has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the consternation of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last resource for a prime minister who is a pretensible and assetated figure, who already suffered a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best of itself with this calcated character of Teresa-May, but the script does not come beyond.
Intelligence advisors informe him that, insofar as every spion active poses danger, he ought to regain some of his pensions.
And this includes the maldiced Johnny English, now employed as a teacher in some luxury institution, but taught extraofficial classes about how to become a agent, with some good gags, like when English offers a spion academy that looks like a rock school.
English is rapidly returned to Whitehall for a emergency meeting with his pacient sequence Bough, role that re-representate Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, linked to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic paper, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofitable.
So, Batman and Robin from when things are put very well in the secret service of His Majesty's secret service enter into action once more and find in Olga Kurylenko in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal female fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the hymn of the trillionary tech charismaticist who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: the sinistre Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odisee of ridiculous bogeries: burning from cambers, burning a French restaurant for fast food, seem chaos doing contrary aboard Volta luxury yote and English causes a great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality casca to familiarize yourself with the inside of the Volta House.
All the parades have been quite extracted from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, all the pledge looks like a child program.
Things pretty normal.
Like Johnny English's other films, it's not helpful to think if the film industry has donated Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice to his talent.
Labour Party refuses to think of a plan that brits should have a work week of four days and cover five
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which brits will work four days every week and pay five.
The party, presumably, wants the heads of companies to pass the savings obtained with the Revolucionary of Artificial Intelligence (IA) to workers giving them a day more celebration.
"They were glad when they were working for a week, but they also received a denarius.
According to sources, the idea would coincide with the economic agenda of the party and plans to reverse the country in favor of workers.
The exchange of a four-day work week accounts with the support of the Federation of Trades Union Union Congress Federation Trades Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
One experienced source of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "It is expected that a review of the policy will be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't be from night to day, but a four-day working week is a ambition that fits in the perspective of the party of balancing the economy in favor of the workers and in the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the campaign of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner currently.
According to a spokesman from the Labour Party, "A four-day working week is not a political party and the party is not considering it."
The Minister of Shadow John McDonnell used the party conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The plans of minister in Shadow also imply that shareholders of water companies could not recover all the investment, since the labour government could apply "deductions" for crimes that I perceived.
He has also confirmed plans to place workers in boards of companies and create funds of property inclusive to deliver 10% of the shares of private sector firms to employees, who expect to buy out annual dividends for a value of up to 500 GBP.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains to "60 Minutes" if FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination to Supreme Court at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the findings of the agency could influence any senator Republican Senate to withdraw his support.
In an interview that will be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if FBI could put something in light that made them change opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his companion from South Carolina.
"I'm serious," said Kennedy.
"I'm saying that I had spoken with Kavanaugh.
I, I, des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des des
"Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
But Graham's voice seems to be burned in fire.
"I have my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would present a explosive accusation," he said.
"Ms. Ford, I don't know what's happening, but I know this: Brett rejected it roundly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Not en person som jeg names, kan sees.
He has 36 years old.
"I can't see you change anything again."
What's the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will welcome this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event, which presents a totally impressive star program, which carry out an impressive mission equally impressive: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of global target global 2030 before end end events.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a international defence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people helping combat it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (if anyone wants to pay a VIP entry), the assistants had to make a series of tasks or "actions", such as making voluntarys, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to awake awareness of the object bar.
What has achieved Global Citizen now that he remains 12 years to achieve his goal?
The idea of awarding people with a free concert is a good way to convince them to require a call to action or simply a case more than we call "clictivism" (a person who think marks the difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen affirms have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its sympathizers, which have helped to achieve various goals.

"The Group estimates that the funds protected are currently have a direct impact in almost 649 million people from 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a association of investors and executives with its in the UK, which pledges to "aid children to grow as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition to the country after receiving more than 4,700 Global Citizens tweets from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can convert social injustice of the malnutrition into a foot of the page of history," said The Power of Nutrition ambassador, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions demanding the UK to improve nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website, who asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen replied, "I'll be a long and hard road. I'll blow down and fail.
But as the great movements of defense against civil rights and against the former apartheid, we will win, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will act at the event of Enguary in New York, who will present Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as "blocking" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of Interior)
Washington can, "if necessary" retreat to Navy to prevent russian energy to hit markets, including those of Middle East," US secretary of Interior, Ryan Zinke, revealed, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke has denounced that Russia's intervening to Syria, mainly where it operates with invitation from the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.

He compared Washington's strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuel," he said, indicating that Russia has only a resource, because its economy depends on fossil fuel.
Declarations arrive while Trump administration has been in a mission to stimulate export of its gas gas liquid to Europe, in substitute for Russia, the most economic option for European consumers.

18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Divuit states and Columbia District support legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flet from bands or domestic violence
Representatives of 18 states and the district presented a friend curiae curiae Friday in Washington to collect an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions case claim that the American Union for Civil Liberties submitted in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his wife "and the sons of the violent band member" attacked her, but American officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
I'm arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of States supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there is a great number of asylum seekers in the USA, as countries that are facing generalized problems of bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy revoked a decision of 2014 from Imigration Apelations Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape from domestic violence to request asylum.
The prosecutor general of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, declared Friday that the new policy "ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal laws require that asylum requests be adjudicated according to the facts and circumstances of the demand, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to amicus curiae.
Advocats also argued in the report that the policy that denies the entrance of immigrants harm the economy of the United States, as it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary jobs".
In June, Prosecutor General Jeff Sessions ordered imigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims who fled from domestic violence and bands.
"The asylum is available for those people who leave their country for persecution or for racial reasons, religion, nationality or belonging to a concrete social group or political opinion," he said Sessions in his ad on 11 June of this policy.
Asylum has always been ahead of all the problems, and the worst problems, to which people face every day in the whole world.

The US ambassador accuses China of sedimentating with "propaganda ads".
A week after a official Chinese publication published a four-page announcement in a American newspaper promoting mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump was addressed Wednesday last Wednesday to China Daily's payment supplement in The Des Moines Register, the most selling newspaper of state of Iowa, after accusing China of intervening in elections in the US Congress on 6 November U.S., accusation that China negates.
Trump's accusation according to which Beijing attempted to intervene in US elections marked what US officials have explained to Reuters that it is a new phase of Washington campaign to intensify pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to insert advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that intensifies and that has seen securing tariffs on mutual import.
China's venetian tariffs at the beginning of trade war were intended to punish exporters of states, such as Iowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and Iowa Exgovernator for a long time, an important exporter of agricultural products in China, claimed Beijing had damaged workers, farmers and US companies.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary article at The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It dots abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"In revealing his propaganda, the Chinese government uses the estimate American tradition of freedom of expression and free press by inserting a payment ad to The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In cambio, at the kiosk that's down here in Beijing, you'll find little voices discrepant and you'll see no real reflection of the missing opinions that Chinese citizens could have about the economic pathway worrying about China, since the media are dominated by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.

Republicans apart from women voters before mid-parlamentary elections with Kavanaugh disaster, they warn analysts
"As many of the leading Republicans support and defend the candidate in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who faced various requests for sexual aggression, analysts have warned that they will see a negative response, particularly among women, at the next mid-parlamentary elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extreme high, and most Republicans already officially show that they want to make a step forward with a vote.
These things can't be deleted," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political sciences at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, at The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the last hour pressures of senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to carry out an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm down angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, ni tomorrow, ni November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesman of the progressist group MoveOn, Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
Friday morning, protestants cried "november is coming!" (November approaches) while they appeared in the Senate vessel, while Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to continue nomination Kavanaugh in spite of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of demokrats will remain out of the graphics," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in place of news.

"That has become a embolic for the GOP," said Michael Steele, ex-president of Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the board or the final vote, it's not only about whether Kavanaugh sits in the bank of the accused. It's also about how Republicans have managed this topic and how they have treated it with it," noted Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps choose democrats. notícies, canal
However, Americans seem to be split between those who believe in the Ford Star and Kavanaugh Testimonials, with the balance that departs mildly to the last.
A New Survey by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of the surveys believe insufficiently or probabilly insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently insufficiently ins.
38 per cent said that Kavanaugh believed that Kavanaugh had mentied probabilly or doubtful during his testimonial, while 30 per cent affirmed the same by Ford.
After Flake's pressure, FBI is currently investigating Ford's demands and, at least, another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before Senate Judicial Committee under oath under oath last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez adjudicate that the candidate to Supreme Court taught him genitals in a party while they studied Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Planes to Create New Internet to Competition with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the web inventor is launching a new company that intends to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that is based on the Solid Open Code Platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid platform allows users to choose where their data are stored and who people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that Inrupt's hidden intention was "dominating the world".
"Eh, he's got to do it now," he's said from the emergent company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal data storage online" or a POD.
You can contain contact lists, lists of tasks that are waiting, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spoify. All these are available in a browser simultaneamente.
What is excluded from personal data store online is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it "personal impedance through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and aptitudes adequate so that Solid platform can be available for everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers contracted to work in the project and a community of voluntary encoder.
From this week, technology developers from all over the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps through tools available on Inrupt website.

"We don't ask them permission."
In a Saturday publication to Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect integrity and quality of the new web integrated into Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed Internet when founded World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology of Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, World Wide Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Cross Victory of the I GM
The only clergy of the church of England who won a Victory Cross during the First World War as a fighter has been honored in his native city 100 years later.
The Tenant Colonel and Honor Bernard Vann obtained the guard on 29 September 1918 through the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was abbatued by a franchiseer four days later, and never knew that he had won the most important British military honor.
Her two uncles devastated a memorial stone on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his nephews, said that it was "majorly symbolic" that the lapida appears just 100 years after his uncle's guarded prosecution.
According to The London Gazette, 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann directed his battle against Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick and under the intense fire of canons and metrallers".
Later he fled to the fire line and, with the "maxima courage" made the line advanced before he lanced on a canoe with one hand and left atonics three members of the division.
The Tenant Colonel was abolished by a German franchiseer on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a prose that could never equate, which resulted in a feeling of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the departure, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was very honoured of being part of the release and added that the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by support that will receive a lot of people.
MMA fans who stayed unleavened all night to see Bellator 206, see Peppa Pig instead of their
Imagine that you're awakening all night to see Bellator 206 and that you're gonna need to see the most important event.
The San José cartell contained 13 battles, including six of the main card and were to be seen live all night in the UK at Channel 5.
6:00 p.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for confrontation, British viewers remained atonic when programming changed to Peppa Pig Peppa Pig.
And some of them were distressed, because they had been awake in the night until the morning, to see the battle.
A Twitter follower described the change in animated drawings as "a type of vomitiu acudit".
"Reglamentation of the government says that at 6:00 p.m. this content is not adequate, so they changed to child programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice President of Marketing and Communications of Bellator, when they asked him about retransmission.
"Peppa la shirtta, yeah."
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they would work in the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of the repetition, I think it can work," said Coker.
"But there's six of the morning of a Sabbath, and we'll not break it until the Sabbath, until the Sabbath, until the hour of our hour, until the Monday.
But we work there.

We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.

Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daley argued that he had grown feeling lower than the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that gave him motivation to win.
The 24 year old athlete said that he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that not everyone was like him.

The regular presentator of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off for disease.
Daley, who appeared as a naufrag in Laverne's first program, said that he felt "minder than" the others because "it was not socially acceptable like boys and girls."
He said, "Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me power and power to win."
I wanted to prove that it was "something", he said, so that nobody would disappoint when you finished discovering their sexuality.
The two winners of the Olympic bronze medal has become a high profile promotor of LGBT movement high profile and has used his image of the Commonwealth Games of the Commonwealth Games of Australia in Australia to ask other countries that decriminalizing homosexuality.

"My gold medalja is Robbie."
His son is said to be like his father, Robert, who died in 2011, when he was 40 years old due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father didn't accept that he was dead and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012, because he wanted to be first line.
"Non, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
"When I grabbed his hand, I stopped breathing, and it wasn't until then, it was already dead, and I finally agreed that it was invincible" ".
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that that was what dreamed of all my life: jumping before a crowd house in some Olympic Games, and there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the trio of his first song (Proud de Heather Small), which he had listened during the preparation for the Olympic Games, and which he still placed the skin of chicken.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's award was presented at the Ryder Cup Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will beat a Sunday record playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his physical status if he doesn't want to become an unfortunate band.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biannual event to fight a record for 12th time, was presented by Captain Jim Furyk for modalities "fourballs" and "fourballs" and "foursomes" Saturday Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of action, as usual for the United States, the winner of five main tournaments divides his time between making animator and working in his game on the field, with hopes to correct what does hurt him.
He never made the most direct drivers, not only at the moment of his career, but the 48-year-old player is not the ideal option for the difficult pathway of Le Golf National, where long rough habituate to punish lost cops.
And if his own trajectory isn't decoratious enough, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth match, will confront the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win the four matches of this week.
If Americans, four points down to start the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson match could become absolute crucial.
Furyk, who had confidence in this man, was incapable of saying anything else.
"He understood perfectly his role in that day, he made me a palm palm in the back and he roded me with his brace while he said that he would be ready for the next day," said Furyk.
"Jeg har stor tilliten til meg selv.
It's a celebrity hall and has brought a lot to these teams before and this week.
Probably, I didn't imagine him playing two matches.
I wasn't afraid of it. I wasn't afraid of it. I wasn't afraid of it. I wasn't afraid of it.
He wants to be there like any other."
Sunday, Mickelson will overcome Nick Faldo record of the maximum number of matches of Ryder Cup games.
You can mean the end of a race at the Ryder Cup that has not equaled your individual registry.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 defeats and 7 matches, although Furyk has stated that his presence has contributed intangible to team.
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
"I think younger players also enjoyed staying with him this week, which was a pleasure to see.
It’s a lot more than your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that advantages can be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, know by experience that starting with considerable advantage individual duels of Ryder Cup last day can easily become in a hard day.
The Danish debuted 1997 in Valderrama, when the Captainship team by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved the victory at least, 14,5-13,5.
"Et continue reminding that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we lost, where we lost, but for little", Bjorn, on the picture, after seeing the victory of the team of 2018 for 5-3 both Fridays as well as yesterday, leaving the National Golf in Le-6 in 10 marker.
The story has taught us to me and to all the members of the team that haven't finished yet.
"Dema's got all the machine.
He must go out and do everything good.
This will not end until the points get to the marker.
We have a goal, we try to win the trofee, and we must keep the concentration to do so.
I've already said, I'm focused on the 12 players we have in the team, but I've also seen who are our rivals: the best players in the world."
Enjoyed the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rash with this.
Morning will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will mark the difference and change everything.
It's great to be there with a friend when it's all right, but individual duels test your ability to play golf.
This is the message you must send to gamers, to remove the best of you tomorrow.
In this time, leave your friend and he must go out and take the best of himself."
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk, expects his players to make better individually than in team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who summed three points of four.
Furyk knows both the money's money over the refunds of last day, as he was part of Brookline winners team before he ends losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
"I remember exactly all the words," he responded to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 major matches, but we want to start with good foot, like it saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, it generates much pressure in these central duels.
"We have prepared the alignment according to circumstances and the best way to try to make magic tomorrow."

The German Army's new fragrance should have been completed in 2014 to replace the ancient warships of the Cold War era, but it will not do so, at least, until the year that comes out of defect systems and a cost increase, according to local media.
The completion of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg class fragests, has been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit.
The vessel should have joined the Army in 2014, but the subsequent problems in construction have marked deadlines of this ambitious project project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels that the Armada ordered in 2007 replace the ancient fragstates of the Bremen class.
It is believed that it will include a powerful canon, a set of anti-air and anti-boot missiles, as well as technology against theft action, such as a redundant radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.

However, these continue delays implye that frontal vessels, which were expected that they could project Germany as a powerful force abroad, would already be obsolete when they enter operational, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fragata F125 was already news last year, when the German Army rejected the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss drassana in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Armada returned a boat to the builder once delivered.
It is known a few details of the reasons why it has returned, but the German media have quoted various "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it inservible if it was used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, since 120 marines, half of the crew needed for former Bremen class fragges, operates in Baden-Württemberg class boats.
In addition, it is also known that the weight of the ship is excessive, it reduces its performance and limits the ability of Armada to add future improvements.
It is believed that the Rheinland-Pfalz, 7,000 tons, will weigh twice as much class vessels similarly used by Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defect material, the cost of the project, which includes crew training, also begins to assume a problem.
It is believed that it has reached some surprising $3.100 million (3.600 million $3) from an initial budget of $2.200 million $.
The problem of the new frags has become a particularly important issue, if we take into account recent warnings that indicate that Germany's marine military power is weakening.
Hans-Peter Bartels, defensive committee head of German Parliament this year, admitted that Armada "is left without ships that can be used".
The officer said that the situation has aggravated over time because they stopped using the old ships, but they did not give them any more as a replacement.
"Han regrette, at Baden-Württemberg-klass fragmatas couldn't join Armada.
the National Foundation Spy the Secret Life of the Ratpents
A new research carried out in a finca of the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how the ratpents use the landscape to feed themselves.
The discoveries are expected to bring new data about the behavior of these only flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists of the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to rapen soprano and common, plus rapen northern orellots and water in the botanical garden of Inverewe, situated in Wester Ross.
They will place special recorders in key property locations to do tracking the activities of the ratpents during the station.
Voluntaris and staff of the UK National Health Service will also perform mobile surveys with portable detectors.
Analysis of sound of records by experts will determine the sound frequency of ratpents and what each species does.
With this information, you will create a report and a map of habitat to create a detailed image in the scale of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, advisor of Natural Conservation of the National Foundation of Scotland, expects results to show which areas of habitat are more important for ratpents and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management work, such as the creation of tables, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for ratpents and other species associated.
The population of ratpents in Scotland and the rest of UK has declined considerably in the last century.
The tasks of building and restoring buildings are a threat to those who are tormented, because they are affecting the nebula and can cause the loss of living.
Wind and lighting turbines are also risked, as well as the matmosc paper and chemical treatments used in construction materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, the rashs are not blind.
But because of their habits of the night and the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when they are able to take them.
Use a sophisticated eco location technique to place insects and obstacles that intervene in their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the rapened very seriously.
It has ten experts with adequate training, which perform surveys, inspections of the niss and, sometimes, rescues normally.
In addition, the organization has created the first and only reserve of Scotland dedicated to ratpents in the Threave Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the eighth house of the ten species of ratpent in Scotland.
David Thompson, Finca Manager, states that it is the ideal territory for species.

Ronaldo refute accusations of violation while his advocates prepare apel against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has stated that accusations of violation against him are "false news" and has stated that people "will become famous" thanks to their name.
The prosecutors will investigate the German Weekly Magazine Der Spiegel, responsible for publishing the accusations.
The front of Portugal and the Juventus has been accused of violating a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Supposedly, he paid in his time $375,000 because the incident is not public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers hours after the accusations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed that they were "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"Dessutom, desidere debattens debattens debattens.
It's normal.
They want to take advantage of my name, but they are part of my job.
“I’m a happy man and everything’s okay,” adds player, smiling.
Ronaldo's advocates already prepare the appeal against Der Spiegel for accusations, which have qualified as "inadmissible information of suspicions on privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz claimed that the player will seek to obtain compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant infringements of personal rights in the past few years".
The presumptuous incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the hotel and casino Palms of Las Vegas.
After dating at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they suspected that it violated illegally, according to reports archived by the Jutjat of the Clark County District, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo sneaked after the presumptuous incident and told him that he was a "99% good guys", except a "1%".
The documentation argumenta que Ronaldo confirmed que both had sexual relations, pero they were consented.
Mayorga also states that he went to police and took photographs of the lesion in hospital, but he later accepted an agreement off courts because he had "for represalies" and concerns him "to be humiliated publicly publicly".
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to annulle the agreement, since she continues to be traumatized by the presumptuous incident.
Ronaldo was ready to file for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the presumptuous incident and this summer has filed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "is always tendered" to lose automakers
The UK "will always regret it" if you lose the world leader state in manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "required" that the base of Toyota Toyota in the UK said to BBC that if the UK would leave the EU without agreeing, it would temporarily stop production at Burnaston factory near Derby, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays on borders in case of Brexit without agreement could cause loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My point of view is that, if UK leaves EU without agreement at the end of March, it will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Out of the EU without agreement on how trade will work with the rest of the EU countries has awakened pores of other UK automakers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in production chain in case of Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is made on a base "just time", with pieces that arrive every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and EU for automaking.
If UK leaves EU without reaching agreement on 29 March, it is possible that there may be disruptions at the border, which the sector considers that could generate delays and fish shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventario for more than a day in Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it should stop production as a consequence.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with EU is "kalibrated precisely to avoid these border controls".
"We must reach an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that we can allow it, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but also enjoy this opportunity", he said to the BBC Radio 4.
"Tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to continue with a set exitus of production chains."
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long the production would stop, but, in the long term, has warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of United the Union at the plant, said that members begin to be very concerned about situation: "Per experience, when they lose these jobs, they never return."
A government spokesman said, "We have designed a plan that is precise and credible for our future relationship with the EU."
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be rediscovered
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Prosecutor General Adjunct Rod Rosenstein could "posposed a week" while continuing the struggle over the nominated at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in statements of the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervised the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and help Trump and possible obstacle to justice by President.
"Whether Trump is accused or not by Vice Prosecutor General and risk Mueller's independence, he's feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of deposing president with 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has rejected the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House among rumors that he was about to deny.
"That's noted a meeting with Trump, who was in United Nations in New York, and was in the United Nations in New York.
The Trump Trump Trump said that "I would prefer not not" would "not" accompanied Rosennstein, Rosenstein, but it was held the meeting, but it was up the meeting to to prevent to avoid a confrontation with the hearing of the Senate of the Senate of the Senate judicial committee of the Senate, which they testified Kavanaugh and Kavanaugh and one of the women who testified him he accused him of bad bad sexual sexual behavior, Dr Dr Dr Dr Dr Dr Dr., Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr.................
Trump ordered a weekly investigation to the FBI of the accusations against Kavanaugh, making it more profoundly voted throughout Senate.

But we'll see it. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may refute this statement: Sanders has not made any informational session of the White House since September 10th.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of information sessions was not because he didn't like the fanfaronerie of TV journalists, even though he said, "I won't deny that they're fanfaroners."
He added that there would be increased contact direct between Trump and the press.
"President has more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before he added the following without citing any source: "We have consulted these data."
Sanders has said that the information sessions will continue to take place, but "if the press has the possibility to ask directly the President of the United States, it is very infinitely better than talking to me.
"We try to do this often, you've seen us do so much in the past few weeks, and you'll substitute informative sessions when you can talk to President of the United States."
Trump responds to questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press wheels with dignity official visit.
Individual press wheels are rare.
This week, in New York, maybe the president has demonstrated why, after a informal appearance and, some times, strange before the journalists gathered.

Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax tax when buying a property in UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax tax when buying a property in the UK with the extra money used to help people without home according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
Increase in taxes will be recorded in those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda expects to get up to 120 million frees annually to help people without home.
It is expected that foreign purchasers will pay a higher tax tax in buying a real estate in UK and these money will be used to help people without home, as Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable habitats that would affect higher incomes.
The tax increase will be recorded in those persons and corporations who do not pay tax in the UK; these funds will be targeted to the government action to combate numbers of people without households.
The overload, which will be added to current timbre tax, including the highest level introduced two years ago in second residence and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get us up to 120 million frees annually.
13% of London's new construction properties are residents of non-British residents, making it easier to increase prices and make it difficult for new buyers to open up in the scale of property.
Many well-being areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" starting from a large number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside of the country.
The new measure arrives weeks after Boris Johnson has asked for a reduction in time tax to help young people have their first home.

Britain will always be open to everyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it can't be correct that it's just as easy for people who don't live in UK, as well as for businesses with their own abroad, buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For many people, the dream of having a house in possession is too remote, and the indignation of people without house makes it even more real."
Jack Ross: "My maximum ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach, Jack Ross, said that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotland has accepted the challenge of revising the North-East Club, which currently takes third position in League One, at three points of the leader.
He arrived in Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to Scottish Premiership last season.
"Jeg ønsker å spille for mitt land, da jeg var spiller.
They called me once as support and that's all that," Ross told BBC Sportsound program Scotland.
"But I grown up I saw playing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a little and always it's something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I have successful training in clubs, but."
Ross's predecessors in the office of Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach claims that he doesn't feel the pressure to be the following in a list of names devoted to such a big team, after rejecting previously offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now, my criterion to measure my success will be if I can bring this team back to Premier League.
"Med the structure and installations of club, it's obvious that its place is Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but just think I've been successful here if I can make the club back there."
Ross is only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months at Hearts Technical Body.
He helped Alloa to avoid descending into third category and transformed St Mirren from fighting for salvation to champions of the Champions Championship in the following season.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than during his stage as player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"That's probably been a decisive moment," he remembered about accepting the task at Alloa.
"I always thought that training was what gave me better than to play.
I am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad, am glad.
But playing can be very hard.
There are many things you need to overcome every week.
I still feel like stress and pressure in the work, but I feel like a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, it's the time I'm feeling more comfortable since I'm adult."

The perfect hour for a painting is 17:30 a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer warmth anonada has shot consuming bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to restaurants chains.
Bars and bar chains have gained a 2,7% increase in sales in July, but consumption in restaurants has decreased by 4,8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, from CGA Financial Advisory, the company that collected data, says: "Continuous hours of sunshine and England's participation in the World, which has expanded more than unexpected, have made July more like a pattern of the case of the CGA finance,except July's case of the most similar model,except June's case,in which they have grown in the bar,
The reduction of 1,8% in consumption in restaurants in June has been aggravated in July.
Bars and taverns, led by drinking, achieved the best results, while consuming in restaurants went to the bottom.
The bars that offer food have suffered with the sun, even though it wasn't so dramatic as the case of restaurants.
It seems like the people only wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased 6,6% over the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, RSM OC and Hotel Analysts, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The time and the impact of of the great social social or sport sport is remain remain the key factors of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
It's not surprising that restaurants continue to have problems, but a decrease in sales by 4,8% interannual would be particularly nocive, more than continuum pressure on cost.
This summer such long and hot couldn't have come in a worse time for shopping serving food and the weather will say if the moderate temperatures we have had in August will give this breath so necessary."
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including open recently, was 2,7% in July, given the alentement in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 groups operators, with combined loss of over 9 million livres and is the set of sector reference point.
One in five children has secret accounts of social networks that hide to parents
One in every five children, some 11 years old, have secret accounts of social networks that they hide to parents and teachers, according to data from an enquête
A survey between 20.000 secondary students showed a increase in "Insta false" pages.
News have made the fears growing about sexual content publication
20% of students claim that they have a "principal account" that show parents
One in every five children, some 11 years old, create accounts of social networks that hide from adults.
A survey among 20,000 secondary students indicated a rapid increase in "Insta false" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site to share photos.
News have caused fears over sexual content posting.
20% of students say they have a net "primary" account that they show to their parents, while they also have one private.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager who invited others to "violent me".
Research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Private School Manager Committee (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of adolescents between 11 and 18 years old have two profiles, half of which admitted that private accounts have two profiles.
Mike Buchanan, CEO of HMC, said: "I am alarming that many teenagers are tempted to create online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Vision of Sports" in the Scotland Athletics Federation Directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-Executive Director of the Directive of the Scottish Federation of Athletics at the annual general meeting of the organization.

"Eilidh has respect for Scotland's atletism community, UK's and around the world, and we're sure that Scotland's atletism will benefit from their incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I have a lot of anxiety to act as a voice of athletes, and I hope I can make the sport grow and contribute to Scotland."

An advertisement of guns that compare mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A tirelet company has shared opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing mammals with cows that are multiplied.
In order to mark the release of what is considered the "first silent tirelet that can be carried from the world", the technology company for consumer Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that gives the new tirelet to oceans.
"Four king mothers dance in a grain full of bulbs and bowls in the rhythm of a song that includes letters, 'I am much careered for myself, but you'll see no one', and 'If you didn't realize, they're not bracelets, but my breasts.'"
"Bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, munyo, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe, bombe."
However, the ad, published on the Facebook page of the company, has caused controversy on the Internet.

"A lot of bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.

Elvie Tirelet is discreetly hidden in a lactation supporter (Elvie/Mother)
Another person said, "I understand that it's traumatic for mother and baby.
"And now why not use them to tell them that they're going to be a kidnapping for mothers and mothers who'll keep their babies and their babys?"
Another user added, "It's a site off advertisement".
Others defended the announcement; a woman admitted that she found that the song was "very fun".
"I think that's a great idea.
I would buy one if I still needed to give it to my mother.
I'm just like a cow. I'm just like a cow.
Announcement is a little crazy, but it's got to take it like it's.
“It’s a good product,” wrote a user.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who pump with guns (normally at their workplace or in the labyrinth and feel like they were vacuum).
"I'm not going to read or judge the lactic industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've danced all with the tirelet ficat discreetly to supporters.
The concept that the campaign re-return is based on the perception that many women say that they feel as if they were vacuum when they use tirelet .
However, Elvie shooter is totally silent, it has no cable or tube and fits wisely in a breastfeeding supporter, making it more free for women to move, submit babys and even out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, socia and developer of Mother's first childhood, declare: "Elvie shooter is a product so revolutionary that deserves a courageous and provocative campaign.
In tracing the parallelism between women and vacas, we wanted to show the public how it uses a tirelet and the challenges it supposes to do, once we demonstrate, entreteningly and educatively, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new tirelet.
This isn't the first time the Elvie shooter came out in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two sons appeared in the pastel for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children, silently transferred to a tendens camp at Texas border
The number of children emigrants retented has increased even though monthly entries through the border have remained practically stable, partly because the retorical hardness and policies introduced by Trump administration have complicated children's adoption of children.
Traditionally, most parents were immigrants without papers, who have had to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decide to accept a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible fathers and the remainder of adults living in their homes will have to send digital fingerprints, which will share with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Imigration and Dune Control Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to accompany minors non-company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no penal precedents.
"Maximum 80% of the people who have accommodated or lived in the home of a person who have accommodated are illegal in the country, and the vast majority of them are criminal aliens.
"So we will continue to pursue these people," said Albence.
In order to process children faster, officers have introduced new rules that require some must present to court in a month after being retented, rather than 60 days, which was the pre-standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear via videoconference, rather than honorably, to defend their case to obtain legal status before a judge of emigration.
All those who do not want to help, will be deported immediately.
The more time the children spend in custody, the more likely they will suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent ramplings or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports that you have given to know system system in the past months.
Advokats argument that these concerns can be intensified in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely, because of their size, to pass high signs indicating that a child is suffering.
They added that transferring children to camp without having time to prepare them emotionally, or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that already suffer many.
Syria calls for "Occupation Forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Direkting to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Muallem, asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has dured eight years ago.
Muallem, who also acts as Vice Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "the subject will be treated consequently".
"Son must be withdrawn immediately and without condition," he said to the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that "terror war has virtually ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and the conflict has caused millions of displacements.
"Damascus would continue to "mutiate this sacred bataille until we have purified Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to form and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country hit by war.
Muallem, a propos de la question de la refugiata, affirme que conditions were good for his return and culpable "some Western countries" de la fusion "irracional" de la refugiata de la refugiata de la repatriation.
"We've complained to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicized a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no aid for Syria's reconstruction until there will be a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end war.
The diplomats of the United Nations have stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone at the end of the great rebel bastition, Idlib, has preferred the opportunity to continue with the political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack of Syrian forces with the assistance of Russia in the province, where 3 million people live.
However, Muallem noted that agreement has "clear termins" and expressed the hope that militar action will face jihadists, including combatants of Front Al-Nusra. linked to Al-Qaeda, that "shan will be erradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, sending from the UN, expects to convene the first meetings soon of a new committee formed by members of the government and the opposition to start profiling a post-war constitution and prepare the path towards elections.
Muallem exposed the conditions of the Syrian government's participation to the committee, the task of which should be restricted to "revising articles of the current constitution" and warned from possible interference.
Why Trump Wins For the Second Time
According to this logic, Trump would again win the elections in 2020 at least that, as many liberal spectators likely expect, scandals and destitution process end with his presidency prematurely.
What would be, without doubt, "the end of a more dramatic presidency in history".
They don't see signs of fatigue in the sights.
Since 2014, the number of spectators in the horarion of maximum audience has more than doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN and practically tripled up to 1.6 million in MSNBC.

External money inundate courses of media legislature elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is not surprising that there is a flood of cash in 17th district of Pennsylvania, thanks to the realization of congressional districts that have made two current members to compete for the same place.
This recent reasignation from Pittsburgh suburban district implies Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who obtained the place in another district after special elections last spring.
Lamb faced another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the ancient 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is in conflict with the nine 17th district of Pennsylvania.
The maps were renegated after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the antik districts were unkonstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has launched a financial war between the principal financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).

US impose sanctions to Salvador for their support to China, but they removed them
The diplomats observed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response by Washington.
Trump maintained a tense meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners were out of the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Department of State decided to withdraw heads of US diplomatic missions to Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on the fact that Taiwan stop recognizing," Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Department, said this month.
However, it was only considered the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 aid from US $ 140 million, according to estimations, for control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements.
The sanctions proposed, including the cut in the financial aid and restrictions in the visa issued, would be harmful to the Central American country and the high numbers of deaths by homicide and arrest.

But to mid-September, senior officers of the administration clarified that they wanted the meeting to happen, making it finished effectively with any probability of sanction for Salvation.
Vice-President Mike Pence was elected for meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance of the administration gives there, according to diplomats.
The three American sendings returned discreetly to their mandate of Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions by Washington.
A spokesman of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officers, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, confirmed the statements.
Study History
The next incident in occurrence could be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible Trump obstruction of justice, from which there are numerous evidence in public registers.
As it is known, Mueller also investigates whether Trump campaign co-operated with Russia in his attack on elections.
If Congress changes his hands, Trump could find himself accounting for the body, just when he prepares to do so before voters, and even before a jury of members of the party.
It's a lot of circumstances, and I don't want to suggest that Trump's fall, either of his European humanities, is inevitable.
There are decisions that must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the situation will take.
In 1938, the German officials were willing to make a coup of state against Hitler, only if western block had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that came after.
The course of history varies over points of inflexion like this and accelerates or backwards the inexorable progress of democracy.
The United States is confronted with various points of inflation in the present.
What happens if Trump joined Rod Rosenstein, adjunct prosecutor general adjunct, the man who controls the fate of investigation over Mueller?
Rosenstein has been with water on the throat since this newspaper reported that, last year, suggested to secretly record the president and speculated that it was not suitable for the job.

A knee injury prevented the midcampist Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 game against the Vila-real, but believe that Rangers can use this result as trampoline to achieve great results.

The two of them could be sentenced to death, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a great federal jury attacked Saipov with an accusation letter with 22 defects that included eight charges of murder in favor of the organized crime, that federal prosecutors often used in cases of mafia, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors claimed that the attack required a "grand planning and premeditation" and described how Saipov acted as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov provocora lesion, daños, perjudices, familias, friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the report.

Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, nadiu of Uzbekistan, he not demonstrated grief in the days and months after the attack.
Police explained that she told the investigators that she felt well about what she had done.
According to the accusation writing, Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also requested that the flag of ISIS be deployed in his hospital room.
He is not accused of 22 missing accusations.
David David David Patton Patton, salah salah David David Patton, salah of of of of of of of representative of of Sai Sai Sai Saipov,,,, De De David David, of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
"We think that the decision to demand death penalty instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a perpetual chain without possibility of freedom will only prolong the trauma of these events only for all the people involved," Patton said.

Analyst composed a cronology of the night that burned a woman live
The prosecutor concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning live a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the Department of Justice, testified for hours as expert witness of the field of Intelligence Analysis.
He described the jury how he used cell phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received localization data from different cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the moment when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.

"When the prosecutor asked if Tellis would say the truth when he said he was at Sanford's trucks that night, Sanford said he ly, because his trucks were at Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that she had been a couple of weeks known to Chambers when she died.
The telephone records indicated that it was only a week that they knew each other.

Women's Love Penge Cards to Stop Suicide to a Bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have suicided, are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been laying cards on a galace Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for help.

Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davids created the cards "for the people know there are people who can come to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Is Going for a Wire While FBI Starts Research
"I thought that if we could get something like what he asked (a investigation with a range and limited time), we could get a certain unit," said Mr. Flake Saturday. He added that feared that the committee would be devastated with the rooted dead point of supporters.
"Why wouldn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican supporters want us to investigate FBI?

Name of North Korea desertors "cau" with Kim
The number of North Korean desertors in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un reached power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, all citant data from the Southern Unification Ministry said that 1.127 desertions were produced last year, compared to 2.706 of 2011.
Mr Park said that stringent border controls between North Korea and China and the rise of prices covering traffickers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.

Seul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war end in 1953.
The majority escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China considers illegal immigrants desertors, rather than refugees, and often repatriates forcefully.
Relations between North and South, which are technically still in war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Initial month, leaders of the two countries reunited Pyongyang to maintain conversations focused on parade negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic meeting of the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they agreed to work in general to achieve a Korean peninsula free of nuclear power.
But Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, blamed US sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not dearma ourselves first unilaterally", said Ri in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hystheric" and is not fit to work in Supreme Court
Leader of minority Chamber Nancy Pelosi said that the candidate to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "histeric" and that his temperament the incapacity to work in Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in a interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival celebrated in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman would have done this way, they would have told him that it's a "hysteria", he said Pelosi in relation to his reacción ante Kavanaugh's testimonie before the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, rejected accusations of sexual abuse of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, when both were teens.
Kavanaugh, during his initial declaration, most excited, sometimes crying and staying without words while talking about his family and his years at the institute.
He also expressly condemned the democrats of the committee and said that the accusations against him presumed a "grosc and coordinated killer of a person" organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.

"I think you've dequalified yourself with these statements and the way you've attacked Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi demonstrated reprobation when they asked him if he would try to contest Kavanaugh's election, if it was confirmed, and if the democrats achieve the majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if he's not saying the truth to Congress or FBI, he's not only able to be in the Supreme Court, he's not able to be in the court where he's now," he's not able to be in the court where he's now," he's said.
Currently, Kavanaugh exerce como jurist in the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi adds that, as demokrata, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade case, since it is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings of confirmation, he excluded questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time when a person histerical and with prejudice enters court and hopes that we look awesome," he said.
Females must exerce their power.

How trade war between US and China can benefit Beijing
The initial rescues of trade war between the US and China were alarming and, although it does not seem that war has to end rapidly, a distance the countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning at the beginning of this year, when he imposed taxes on major exports from China, such as solar plates, steel and aluminium.
The most significant scale occurred this week, with new arances that affect products worth $200,000 billion. These arances suppose a taxation on half of all goods that come to the US from China.
Beijing has attacked each time the same way and recently has risen the rates of five to ten percent for $60,000 billion from American goods.
China has compromised to reply USA, and it's unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will be done back soon.
"It is that it it is, but it is that it is, but it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is that it is.
However, experts say that, if Beijing plays well his cards, pressures of trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term, reducing interdependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that initiate a fall in any of these countries is much more dangerous than predicted by witnesses," says Abigail Grace, Asian Associate Research Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is "preparated" for returning refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says she is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and ask for help to rebuilt her country, devastated by a war of over 7 years.
"From General Assembly of the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the country's conditions in the country are improving.
"Actually, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists devastated to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which had to abandone because of terrorisme, and the unilateral economic measures that affected their daily life and maintenance, are satisfied.
The EU estimates that more than 5,5 million siris have fled the country since the beginning of war in 2011.
In addition, 6 million people live in this country and need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime thanked every help to rebuilt the devastated country.

Jordan Spieth was awarded 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European selection Thorbjorn Olesen, Denmark.
The world's best qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 with Ian Poulter, England, who might have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the largest winnour that the tournament ever had, with 25,5 race points.
"I can't cry, but I can't stop it today.
It's been a year very hard.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad, so glad I've recovered the cup.
"The team is the most important... And I am happy to have been able to help," commented an enthusiastic Garcia after European victory.
He won the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single competition Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of having gained Tiger Woods, I've grown up following him," said Rahm, 23-year-old.
Woods lost the four matches he had in France and now has a race record at the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the best players who have existed, with 14 big titles wined and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American selection fought throughout the weekend to search for the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-category golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, Captain of America, spoke after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these players, they've been fighting.
This morning was a moment when we pressed the European election.
We are fighting.
I'll go through the bart for Thomas.
It's a great captain.
12 players played very well.
We will cooperate, work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
We love these 12 players and I'm proud to have been their captain.
I'm going to get the barbecue out.
He has been defeated."
