The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria made a sensitive weakening of both parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a notable strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where current President Wilhelm Molterer's position is seriously threatened, suffers particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the EU election leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphant return on the political stage at national level.
According to preliminary results, Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to 2006 elections, lost 5.5 per cent of votes.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent lost nearly nine percent of the votes, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties; particularly for the popular party, which triggered early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable progress on the SPÖ.
But the voters clearly punished them for having let the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and current deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer were pronounced.
The observers believe that this could happen by Monday at the extraordinary board of the party’s leadership.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the most likely election result, namely the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP major coalition.
However, given the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the free (FPÖ) would have gained 18 percent and the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a reiteration of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FPÖ was still a communist part of the European Union, which is the same as the BZÖ, in 2005.
Haider, who had already stated he was ready to cooperate with any party and intended the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently placed on this evolution.
The last party to have access to the parliament was the Greens, but they slightly lost and, among the Austrian political parties, returned from the third in fifth position.
Obviously, no other party has crossed the four percent limit and has access to the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are likely to cool
If the problem could not be resolved with the Czech researchers accused of illegal cafards, in India, it would be followed by, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The minister declared it today in New York after meeting his Indian co-author Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem wasn't solved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he noted after the meeting, carried out after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, starting from talks, that executive power could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was deleted from the charge and was punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, while the case was placed under the jurisdiction of the case.
"My problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years of jail, would be to appeal to a higher instance.
He could then ask for the liberation under caution and wait for the free judgment, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expressed himself in the same sense as well during conversations.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be grateful," said the Chef of Czech Diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian Minister said.
He also said that such aid had already been provided by India.
“We want to keep the best relationships with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he emphasized before his partner that the Czech Republic gave much importance to the problem that occurred to the Czech entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and charge of these Czech researchers as a great disrespect," he said.
The Minister outlined the question whether India has obtained the promise to deal with the case.
"I've already received a lot of promises," he just noticed.
A Czech Arbitration Fight for the Sea Fund
It approaches a wall electronic card, on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are represented.
But it is not interested in the continent, but at a little lost point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea ground.
This area, however, is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Sea Law.
His head, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completeness from time to time.
The nose at work and enthusiasm characterize the reigning atmosphere.
The sea background hides a little known world, rich in natural resources.
There can be oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also living organisms for the moment unknown, which can contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger background than the earth
The coastal states have now begun to aspire to new submarine territories.
According to the United Nations Convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
This latter may, according to the convention, claim exclusively to all the resources of the continental shelf.
“To simplify, it is considered as a continental shelf the part of the sea and its subground, which constitutes a natural prolongation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the literal sea, often even beyond the two hundred marine miles that represent such an exclusive economic yone,” Mikulka explains.
The request for the country concerned to submit to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf should be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous costly prospects and measurement.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
“One of our roles is to provide the committee with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the committee has addressed five requests: those of Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful,” Mikulka added.
Australia’s success, which is the first to significantly expand its submarine possessions, has recently experienced a global retention.
New Zealand also won the territory - the extent of the sea fund, which the Commission assigned it last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospects.
The profits they will gain in the future of the exploitation of the marine fund will be, as they plan to, invaluable.
Progressively, other countries will, in turn, present their request.
They can do this within ten years after ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean background, declared by the convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no one else enjoys an exclusive position.
The right to withdraw in this area is awarded by an international institution established by convention.
“However, we don’t mistake, the sea background is not a Klondike,” said Mikulka, exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that “these zones are clearly defined and their regime is set in a contract.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the marine background is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other States of the former block of the countries of the East as part of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention, as well as investors from some other States, obtained the status of the so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moving there, it is a kind of submarine reply of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on a range with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich giss of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such concreteness.
She recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were in place for the release of the kidnappers
The Egyptian government had requested Germany’s assistance to resolve the refugee crisis – experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never moved into action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists taken from Egypt are revealed.
According to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defense, the German Special Forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials of the Federal Police Air Scale and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts of Technischen Hilfwerk were on the site of release.
As the spokesman of the Ministry communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were finally not required, the prisoners of refugees who had released their prisoners and escaped when they recognized the imminence of a force-release.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid provided by Germany to integrate it on-site as a support force.
"That hasn't happened so far," said a spokesman from the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers had taken the group of tourists in the south of Egypt, consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their exile in the desert south of Egypt, the kidnappers were translated into the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the occupants has remained wave until now, as well as the details of the release or possible saving payments.
Those who have been saved are in the meantime arrived healthy and except in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated kidnappers were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not say anything about the details of the release.
At the moment, no information was provided on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and special forces should have landed on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress failed shortly to rescue the heavy financial markets of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was in the dark.
With 227 votes against 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the calls of President George W. Bush and politicians head of the two parties, the program that had to juggle the chaos of the financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-funded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debate, had called on the MPs to vote for a favourable vote, though the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones declined by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could cover.
It came shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fall again.
Experts are now projecting new serious turbulence on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, approval and approval of the House of Deputies and of the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
As regards bookings for the next months, according to a study, the sales number has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30%.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the thirst for travel from the Germans remains unsatisfied, according to the study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Agency Federation (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute survey, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to approximately 11 percent more compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyzes monthly the booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings that have been made since the end of August 2008 will be recorded there.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the U.S. would be particularly demanding, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would be approximately one third.
In addition to that, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly searched by the Germans.
Specially organized travels are very demanding, DRV President Klaus Laepple explained.
Given the rising energy prices and food prices, the costs would be "more easily calculable for the customer than for an individually organized journey".
Consumers can save money among others with discounts of pre-booking or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very remarkable that an increase in sales numbers will be recorded again compared to last year – although, according to another study, the number of Germans traveling has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in liter picquets and celebrities in Tyrolian costumes to design.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV animator and wears a custom-tailored Tyrolian costume.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes at the beer party, and the photographers already jump on us and fill their memory card - very flattery, and this is my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolian costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the equator of Weißwurst, my feeling of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on the Teresa Square, everything is half less worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolian costume or leather trousers; no one looks blasphemed or shamefully affected - it is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolian costume collects a few strange eyes coups at the bananas-choco stand.
A Bavarian makes me notice that I would have failed to attach to my table: "Left, in the middle of the virgin, right, in the back of the widow."
Discreetly, I triple my bucket from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and ridiculous.
Others do not feel so bad for these subtle techniques of flirt and wear simple sheets, on which it is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exhibit their rear train naked without being invited there.
The young man in the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and arrives for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" stretched.
He tells me all of this after he's been alive from the soup he'd drank before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks to be a bullshit.
Bob is therefore one of these sadly famous “wild heroes.”
Others have no chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
About eight o’clock in the evening, rescue fans run on the place of the party and have to take care of poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene in a mouse - always by four, they stretch their civilian shelter covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we get back full.
Those who rest in the circle of beverages under the bowl are not visible.
“That’s those who can’t hurt anything anymore,” one of the rescue officers shouts to me in response to my question and then disappears in the mix.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has been released since, under caution.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey was planning to join the European Union, the European powers were expecting to enter its back country.
On the eastern coast of Bosphore, 20 steps from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a new-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation to each of its angles, like some German provincial mayors.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is ruined.
But once within the voucher, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, late in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railroad that arrives to Damascus, Baghdad and has the most well-known land called Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the ice boundaries of the Cold War, has ended.
The British and the empire’s forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition-loaded train exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it is sabotage.
Since then, she slowly falls into ruin, enclosed into the mainstreams of history.
But today, the railroad passage to Anatolia and all eastern points, at least symbolically, serves to emphasize the enlargement of Turkey’s diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Power Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation of its region around, generated by the ice boundaries of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went on a wagon-bed towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish AKP MP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-hour journey, screwed on noise railroads whose cadence recalled the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital-presented as a new city of a new century state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an example of change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspects the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP General District, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and by many cabins in which middle managers in cravate costume men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, cravate, and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an abnormality,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its rear country.
Now she has to look toward the east and the west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But at some point, I asked if Turkey shouldn't choose?"
“Turkey does not want to have to choose between the two.”
He then emphasized an aspect that almost everyone with whom I was able to talk, recalled by heart: The Turkish railroad goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, which is, therefore, as an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey’s integration, the message seems to draw a Europe travelling metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
When I returned to Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought about these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could largely be in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was called the "Europe's sick".
At least there is no doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased September 11th) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
By starting his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic choir of young people, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include the younger than 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20-year-olds refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any kind of music was presented to him, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, and this was thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod repeated to us that "forget that music speaks for herself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is here, in music.
So sing!"
His baguette technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorically or apparent.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be appointed a horseman, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the 1962s to 1982s, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I have seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them has ever disappointed me and, a few times, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “focus only on some people.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your William Woodruff's necology (deceased on September 25) stated that "in 1946, he had resumed his studies in economic history, in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research in 1950, while doing a BSc, MA, and PhD."
This is what comes from Woodruff's author's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, and was later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s, he studied at Houblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to dissimulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " le Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted my attention because of their simplicity and strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that transmits a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magic moments.”
Second assault for Honda's Super Sales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor had already a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
This adds some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
A revolution in front of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aestheticly the new Honda Jazz has a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, we need to stress that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation’s market.
First of all, Honda has renewed this model within a shorter time than the other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Just in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
So, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2009, it thinks to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Spanish subsidiaries hope to sell 2,000 jazz in a year.
This is exactly the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to pay largely the drop in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers hope to end this year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars in less than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8 per cent, compared to 1.6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to get a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - which the Nippo company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
According to the markets and estimated by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five more centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (two more centimeters) and the distance between its axis is 2.50 meters, representing an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change is 1.52 meters.
The dimensions increase and the interior space also.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gasoline reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the wardrobe capacity – which has a double back system – can contain up to 399 liters, 19 liters of additional capacity compared to the wardrobe of the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is improving access to rear places.
The doors that allow access to the rear seats have a 80-degree opening angle, comparing the rear doors of the first Jazz that would open with a 67-degree angle.
Motors are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 liters petrol drives.
Both engines have a i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine gear.
The first 1.2 liters engine develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 tr/min and 114 Nm at 4,900 tr/min.
This motor – which at the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – has a gasoline consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous drive, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaches 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
The 'bees car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of crash prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired, this time, the nature of bees, in particular.
The Japanese company created a robot that, imitating the bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps towards collisions prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Advanced Technical Centre of Nissan Motor Co. have co-worked this small robot in collaboration with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security bowl.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that much resembles the Nissan safety ceiling.
But most importantly, they are the eyes of the bees, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing him to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a Laser Range Finder.
This detects obstacles that are at a distance of two meters and at a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"When it detects a obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a beer and immediately change direction by bifurying its 90-degree wheels to avoid collision.
The greatest difference in comparison to any other existing system is that the maneuvering of escape is totally instinctive.
If so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike a beer, the robot can not be turned up or down, nor in diagonal; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what his wheels allow him and not in infinite directions such as the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and delay, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
“Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
It does not need to retain information or intuitive logic of pre-manipulation, so it can work continuously with only a few dozens of KB of memory.
This can be surprising, but we don’t talk about giga octets of memory or even megaoctets.”
This represents the first development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in the series cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They are afraid to be hypothesed
It must be recognized that the U.S. Treasury, besides having a lot of liquid to make plans, is no engineering.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from entering mortgage at Solvency Banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The luxurious aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Master of Hotel brings us to think about several times if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
This game is sure to provide useful, but not detailed information.
This is a game for teens.
What to do if the game is over?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It’s better than nothing, because it’s impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley Opens Capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its table turnover of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, who will spend nine billion dollars to take up 21% of its capital, a new welcomed by a strong decline in its exchange rate.
A week after disclosure of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of ordinary Morgan Stanley shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price retained is 19% lower than the accounting value of the securities on August 31st.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share lost 6.79% to $23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the bank holding status,” John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group said.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but to pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forced Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more prudent attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday further show that the deal has been modified in the last days: Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“One week ago, Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s Executive Director, said, we think that participation would be entirely made up of ordinary actions.
But because of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley titles 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per action.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert its preferential securities into ordinary shares within a half of a year if the latter exchanges more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that MUFG’s funds will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesman refused to give details on the strategic projects of the new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has said he has “naturally” relieved his balance since late August.
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, who saw his exchange rate fall half while the cost of insurance against a default risk on his debt was flying.
This cost reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch’s purchase, announced that he had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Refund the republic around socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivia Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, was the third to vote on a new constitutional draft.
As 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results with over 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the scores were zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, it had to obtain half of the surcharges more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the release of voting offices and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a wide victory of the "yes" between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed the victory of his constitutional project on Sunday night.
"The Constitution has triumphed in a cruel way," he said, congratulating the Equatorians to the headquarters of Guayaquil Governor, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean homologous Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which took place in peace according to the U.S. State Observation Mission (OEA), carried on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution consacrates the power of the State on the economy by reserved the "planning of development" of a country living essentially from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and currencies sent by its emigrants.
Correa, elected in 2006, also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four years of mandate and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it will use this power and will violate a new mandate in February 2009.
In addition, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President began establishing in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives under the poverty threshold.
Finally, it provides for the ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial base as the starting point of U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 captives were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack against the deceasers of eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts detained for ten days in the desert were brought back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Appearably in shape, the kidnappers arrived at about 15:30 aboard a special aircraft at the military base of Al-Maza, welcomed at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the hospital of Maadi, a residential district of Cairo, to undergo examinations there.
They are in "good health" and "no salary has been paid" to the deceasers," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna said on the burst.
Captured on September 19 at a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of refugees had been ballotated from one to the other by 35 unknown rabbits.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, safari organizer.
An Egyptian security officer said 30 members of the Special Forces, driven on board two helicopters, had launched the attack at night just before lunch.
"An exchange of fire shots occurred, and half of the killers were killed, the others fled," said the official who demanded the anonymity.
He said 150 Egyptian special forces members of the "clear" unit were totally sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a salary.
In the evening, the Sudanese army had claimed that during a patrol, a 4x4 vehicle on board was intercepted, whereby the raids were located, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group of Darfur, the Liberation Movement of the Sudan Unit (SLA-U), which this movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture takes the lead and occupies this election campaign.
So much better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to confess the amount of misery granted to small museums, archives, archaeological searches or national historic places that are hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that he ignores his monuments and heritage buildings?
What do we do in Quebec, like Canada, have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government devotes three million and a half euros to the restoration of the only castle of Chinon in the valley of the Loire?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, in concertation.
In Québec, at the Québec History Society Federation, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 history, heritage, archives and genderology companies are concerned about scanning history, preservation with three under private archives and preservation of archaeological vestiges.
They are often the dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
Governments of Benelux nationalize part of the Fortis Bank
The state of Benelux comes in aid to the Belgian-Netherlands bank, as the first European banking institution in distress due to the snowball effect of the U.S. credit market crisis, by partially nationalizing it. The three countries support a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial institution and also insured interests.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level in this case, also calling for the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been expanding for more than a year, is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be made in the case of this bank will be a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will rescue nearly half (up to 49%) of the bank's capital in each of the countries.
The bank will certainly sell part of its shares, including, first of all, insurance activities, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertigineous fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let her go to bankruptcy.
Only Friday, the company’s shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Given the current value of the shares, the total value of the group’s capital turns around €14 billion, which, according to the company’s leaders, is not realistic.
The company’s leadership accuses the uncertainty of the over-Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the US rescue plan of $700 billion, of being the result of the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, papers have already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank as a new CEO.
The financial body was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors shouldn’t worry, they wouldn’t lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's client circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A rabbit in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information on their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market becomes uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs related to the use of information on prescription drugs, in all cases, with the consent of the data subject.
This type of program must be located in independent hands, otherwise it must confide its chicken to a kidney,” Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in the event of damage, the health status of the customer who appears, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had learned the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily supplied to pharmacies, data on the purchase of the person’s drugs in the eighteen months passed. From this the program itself determines what disease the person suffers and what is his health condition.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducing, this refers to an extremely high fat rate in the blood, which puts it immediately into a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer except papers. However, small problems may still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat buffers, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as a worsening risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they need to request permission from the patient before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
In the past, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been sanctioned for their failures in the past.
Some companies have recently also treated the results of laboratory analysis, and linked them to data on drug consumption, thus they are able to provide an even more precise portrait of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming more and more difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope applies only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the enlargement of the control circle of authorities on companies specialized in data provision is currently present in the Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and therefore he has developed his program even further forward, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is truly free to give his consent, as if he refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and at the end of time, chickens depend on the kindness of the rain.
The Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union and India multiplie their trade by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to the other global issues, largely.
Today, there will also be a summit between France and India, which will mainly be the issue of cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power to which it should be given a broader right of speech in international affairs, but Member States have yet to agree on their support in New Delhi for its appointment as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not have too much interest in this issue, yesterday, at the 9th summit held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and President of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiplie the trade by two billion euros, which means a good increase.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be a too ambitious target.
In this regard, they have legally harmonised the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, in which way air traffic can also increase in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is to balance the situation with India, on the one hand, which is the first trade partner in the EU, and on the other hand New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been severely condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need for a UN conference on this issue has been discussed.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its emissions of toxic substance by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as the fact that a global market should be passed during the climate conference scheduled next year, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convocation of an international working meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now going to the French capital, where during a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, French companies are expected to receive orders for a value of €20 billion for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to information from the press agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Salon.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting in exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Salon is waiting for this edition, more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171.790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 miles of titles in exhibition, and Turkey as an honour guest.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with a point of Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Structure, at the Buchmesse 5.0 papil: an opportunity to present figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign author books gradually decreases in comparison to the total Italian production, and in particular in comparison to that for adults and children.
Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane crash, the billionaire disappeared on 3 September 2007 while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris were found on a 3,000 meters high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is good about the day Steve Fosset traveled on the day he disappeared,” he said during a press conference.
The sheriff said that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) reported that a team of locally sent investigators identified the aircraft: it was Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007 when Fosset departed from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the border with Nevada, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes residence.
These are two documents called Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, money and a pull.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the world’s round on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had run the world on a plane and without stairs.
Among these records, also the one to have stealed at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the common of an original and well-defined design, to marked lines, to large surfaces and net angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last born off road "compact" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of innovation in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content, it will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising batch that will accompany the start of the new car will lead to an unexpected mode of communication, through a futuristic 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milan shopping, Corso Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real and three-dimensional dimensions.
In fact, you will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car goes out of the display.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then reassembled into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertisement, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to raise the interests of future acquirers? We will see well.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed? They are taking part of the Ultras Italy group that has followed the Italian national team for years, and who, so far, have never created big problems.
Neither did he ever hit the adverse tifosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
De Verona, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (in reality) of Campania and the Pouilles were added.
They had three-color flags on which their city of origin appeared: they were all taken away on Saturday evening so that they would not be identified.
They are inspired by the English tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifoseria of true Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian tifos 144 tickets for the party: all nominatives, and therefore easy to control.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had an ongoing Daspo, none had been prohibited from attending a stage.
Four Italian tifos who had stage crime history did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
The Viminal is now waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it may be possible that the arrested or identified in disturbances raise a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits visiting the Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer put foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now is the time for fear-emulation: that is, others are likely to add to the hundred and fifty first.
“We need to shut off this fire immediately, and not legitimize the behavior like this,” the Viminal said.
So, "looking well-open eyes especially in terms of the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Pouilles, there is a small core of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms, which can even rely on a section of the Comfort, i.e. secret services, which are rightly dealing with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce's chœurs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here is the opinion (really not pleasantly expressed) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a prefect in Trieste, where a core of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tiphoses has been ashamed.
“I’m not a sociologist,” the Observatory added, “the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group was in the rules, now we will see well what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about sifflets to Mameli’s hymn: these are also not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not police.
