Rapidly increasing cumulative number of Corona virus disease (Coved-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of the Corona virus disease (Coved-19) shows similar trends in the EU/EEA and UK countries, confirming that although the stage varies from state to state, the Coffid-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Based on Italy ' s experience, States, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of Cowed-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan City, Hobei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative factor, the new Corona virus, is now referred to as the Corona II virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-KOV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-KOV-2 infection has been named the Corona virus disease (Coved-19).
The evidence so far is that approximately 80% of individuals with code 19 suffer from a mild disease; that is, respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, the incidence of code 19 increased to a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate of patients who were hospitalized because of Koed-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of Coved-19 in each EU/EEA and UK (UK) countries and compare them with those from Hobei County, China.
We also compare the current number of Coffide-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries with the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Cowed-19 cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, Covide-19 has increasingly spread geographically and is following the dynamic of the Coffid-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Koed-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurvelians issue of March 5, 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European Koved-19 cases as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In the European Union/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 for persons returning from Wuhan, Hobei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, Cowed-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where between December 31, 2019 to date, 39,768 cases and 1.727 deaths were reported, with 17,750, and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Cumulative number and Cumulative Crude 19 cases obtained
At the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECCDC), the number of reported cases of Koped-19 in every country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization (WHO), is updated daily at 8 a.m.
These data have been used to assess the trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and compare them with those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of Coved-19 ' s active cases, we calculated the cumulative number of Kofeed-19 cases in 14 days, and then took into account the natural trajectory of 19, in all EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported by each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
Covide-19 trends in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of 14-day Coffide-19 cases were followed by those of the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Fig. 1).
For the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom in general, the cumulative number of Coved-19 began to increase on about February 21, and then sharply on February 28, 2020 (supplementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all EU/EEA and UK countries showed trends of an increase similar to the cumulative number of Coved-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of Coffide-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Highlights that as of March 15, 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom reported the total number of actual cases similar to that found in Italy only three weeks ago or less.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of Cowed-19 is rapidly increasing in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative number of Coved-19 indicate that the pandemic is growing at a similar pace in all States.
Although States are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, possible differences in the definition of the situation in States and different protocols for selecting patients who must be tested to confirm that they have been exposed to code 19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation, where approximately 10% of Coved-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission to hospitals and/or intensive care units for Coffide-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not presented).
However, they need to be systematically collected to supplement existing surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios associated with the satisfaction of the health-care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of the Coffide-19 cases that entered the hospital associated with the risk of fgt; 90% to exceed the capacity of intensive care beds, are available in the 6th update of the COVED-19 rapid-risk assessment of the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Given that the cases collected so far in certain areas in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and the fact that hospitals and ICUs usually serve specific regional population groups, it is preferable to provide information on cases and ICUs at the naming level of Statistics 2 regional units (NEUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the Coffide-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the SARS-KOV-2 scenario of sustainable community transition and increase the number of COWID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC rapid-risk assessment, a proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay SARS-KAF-2 deployment as it shifts from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adjust their response accordingly if they are not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-KOV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
If this fails, health-care systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the Corona 2019 virus (Coved-19), caused by the Corona 2 virus (Sars-Koff-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 injuries in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-KOV-2, like its comparable virus, SARS-KOV, which led to thousands of people suffering from SARS in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, Covide 19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than Sars, but it is more mobile and influential between older persons than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving topic of research.
We will address the basics of the epidemiology of the disease, its causes, its own virology, its diagnosis, its treatment, its prognosis and its prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory of all Chinese who were urged to stay in their homes for the weekend and for many weeks thereafter due to an outbreak of an emerging viral disease.
The virus is very similar to that of Corona (Koff), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Saras-Koff-2 on February 11, 2020, and the disease associated with Coved-19 (Coved-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and soon spread throughout the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of code 19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 dead.
The World Health Organization warns that Coved-19 is a “public enemy #1” and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PobMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research papers have been published on Coved-19, including virology, epidemiology, causes, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated through many patients.
The purpose of this review is to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare Coffid-19 with Sars and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Merce, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prediction of the disease, as well as some pressing questions that remain.
Corona viruses have traditionally been identified as non-lethal pathogens in humans, mainly causing about 15% of the four common colds.
Yet, in this century, we faced Corona viruses causing severe diseases in humans twice, i.e. Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff, which caused an outbreak of disease originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a alarming rate of prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, the current Kovid-19 is a third outbreak of the Corona virus in recorded human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, on 31 December 2019, groups with unknown pneumonia were first reported to the Chinese National Health Committee.
Seven days later, the Corona virus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of his first case.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health-care providers, indicating the possibility of transmission from one person to another.
On January 23, Wuhan City was closed down with all public transport suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease stated that of the 41 confirmed cases of infection, only 21 patients were in direct contact with Wuhan Seafood Market, which identified the site of initiation of infection as an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the final scope and seriousness of the outbreak have yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study conducted on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with code 19, provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.wixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-KOV-2 affected people of all age groups, but mainly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the injured were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10.
SARS-KOV-2 injured more men (0.31/10000) than women (0.27/1000,000).
Coved-19 expanded between groups in and around Hobei mainly.
Koffid-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from initiation to diagnosis.
The average period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of injury from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8.13 days).
The basic reproduction figure (basic reproduction number) was 3.77 (the area of confidence is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted base reproduction figure is 2.23-4.82.
The number of injured increased dramatically before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travels before the spring festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44 per cent (the area of confidence is 95 per cent: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06 per cent (the area of confidence is 95 per cent: 2.02-4.59 per cent).
The three main risk factors of Coved-19 were gender (male), age (*60) and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a species of large and coated viruses containing a single positive-directed DNA genome.
It can be divided into four species, Alpha, Beta, Gama and Delta, and it is known that the chlorona viruses of alpha and beta nationality affect humans.
The coated fork (S) of the sugar protein is associated with its cell receivers, i.e., the angiotensin-transformed enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptideal dibetz 4 (DP4) of Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff, respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The DNA gene is released to cytoplasm; after cloning the viral genome, the DNA is associated with diabetic proteins and diaphragm proteins with ferion-containing pyroons, and it merges with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first sars-coff-2 gene sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-KOV-2 was discovered to be a new type of beta-Koff with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples collected from the original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market of Bohan.
Sars-Koff-2 is genetically more like Sars-Koff than Mirs-Koff.
The electronic microscopic examination of the transport revealed that Sars-Koff-2 is located in very thin sections of the human airway.
It was revealed that the human enzyme converting to angiotensine 2 is the future of Sars-Koff-2 as well as Sars-Koff.
However, Protein S of Sars-Koff-2 is associated with the human enzyme converting angiotensin 2 that is weaker than Sars-Koff, which is consistent with the fact that Sars-Koff-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than Sars-Koff.
SARS-KOV-2 can also form an updated short protein coded by orf3b and a coded dissect protein by orf8.
Orf3b in Sars-Koff-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and limit the expression IFNä; however, orf8 does not contain any range or pattern with a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Cho et al. reported on the structure of the total length of the human enzyme converted to engiotensine 2 under the super-cold electronic microscope precisely 2.9 □ within a compound with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a dymer and that ACE-2-B0AT1 could link Protein S, which provided evidence of the recognition of the Corona virus and the infection.
Sodium-based neutral amino acid vector may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-K-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It's been known that Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff both grew up from bats and were transported to humans through yogurt cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing Sars-Koff-2 synaptic development with other Corona viruses, bats were considered the original host of Sars-Koff-2, where the new virus corresponds 96% to two Coronas similar to those called Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the inter-factional barrier remains unknown and has yet to explain the route of transition.
G and others suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a similar recombination within a protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that ant eaters - long tongue-eating mammals mostly used in traditional Chinese medicine - were the potential intermediate host of Sars-Koff-2 based on a 99% genetic symmetry in the Corona virus detected in ant eaters and Sars-Koff-2.
However, the 1% difference spread over two genomes remains significant; thus, we are waiting for conclusive results with concrete evidence (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-KOV-2 remain largely unknown.
Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-KOV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-KOV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature at 56°C for 30 minutes; aether, ethanol at 75% concentration, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorohoxydine, can effectively discourage the virus.
The human race as a whole generally lacks immunity from SARS-KOV-2, and is therefore more vulnerable to emerging HIV infection.
Currently, no detailed study on SARS-KOV-2's immune response has been received.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other Corona viruses, in particular Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff (figure 4).
In general, after the invasion of a host virus, the natural immune system is recognized by PRS-type receivers, including type C-type receivers similar to linen, TLR-like receivers, NLR-type metabolites similar to RIG-I (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammation agents, the maturity of the subtropical cells, and the installation of the IIFN-type interferophones that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate large balm cells for viral antigens.
However, protein N in Sars-Koff can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ B cells stimulate to produce anti-virus objects, and CD8+ cells directly kill HIV-infected cells.
T-cells produce activated cytokines for inflammation to help defensive cells.
However, the Corona virus can reduce T-cell functions by inducing the programmed death of T-cells.
Mixed immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential in combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies were neutralized by a patient of Mers-Koff recovering.
On the other hand, the immune system’s overreaction generates a large number of locally free roots that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, at worst, failure in multiple organ functions and death.
SARS-KOV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is likely to affect older persons with multiple diseases and pregnant women more frequently.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been affected to have a greater chance of infection than others.
The estimated average length of Sars-Koff-2 custody is 1-14 days, or mostly 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average period of custody was three days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as explained above, showed that the period of custody was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8.866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the strictest period of custody, thereby preventing people infected with the infection but not suffering from symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed or infected with HIV are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often the primary and primary symptom of code 19, and can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, sore throat, nasal thoracic, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from respiratory distress and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the condition of patients has evolved rapidly to suffer acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid, and dysentery.
Patients with fever or severe respiratory symptoms and fever should be examined, even without a screening of pulmonary abnormalities, for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for respiratory distress, and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results have been reported in two recent studies of a group of families and groups infected by someone who has not shown symptoms.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that Myrs-Koff patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and respiratory distress (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than Coved-19 patients and were consistent with Meres’ higher mortality rate than Coved-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat infection (21%) were also observed in Mers patients.
In SARS patients, both fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), respiratory distress (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20 - 25%) and sore throat (13 - 25%) proved to be the main symptoms, and respiratory support was required for about 14% - 20% of patients.
By February 14, the Coffide-19 mortality rate had reached 2%, while confirmed cases had reached 66.576 globally.
By November 2002, the SARS mortality rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mers, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study stated that the basic reproduction figure for SARS-KOV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a CI confidence range of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while the basic reproduction figure for SARS-KOV ranged from only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-KOV-2 and Mirs-Koff and SARS-KOV in terms of their own symptoms, mortality rate and basic reproductive number is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-KOV-2 has a higher diffusion potential than Mirs-Koff and SARS-KOV, but it is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, the Sars-Koff-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the Mercs-Koff and Sars-Koff epidemics.
The onset of the disease occurs mostly in the same family, in the same grouping or in the same vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travelling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of mixing people or patients during the last two weeks before the disease appears.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a natural or low number of oceanic white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, the lack of lymphocytes was detected with the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L, including the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L; and high levels of an asphalt and blood spatter in 1,099 patients with code 19.
The levels of liver enzymes, muscle and muglobin have risen in the blood of some patients, and the increase in the reaction protein C and the rate of red carcinogens in the blood of most patients have increased.
In patients with severe conditions, D-demer levels have risen, resulting from fibrin fractures in blood, and the number of lymphocytes has gradually decreased.
Disorders in radiography are apparent in most of the Koped-19 patients and are characterized by double filaments or dark glass classified in the lungs.
Patients sometimes suffer from abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory stress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and advanced fibrosis severely influence the exchange of gases.
The functional imbalance of type 1 and type 2 pulmonary cells reduces surface activation level and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
So, the worst results of chest X-rays are often compared to the extreme severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of Coved-19 showed the fragmentation of the pulmonary cells, the formation of the healing membrane, the leaching of the cell lymphocytes, and multi-cellular cell cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome, similar to what happens to patients with SARS and Mers.
The detection of SARS-KOV-2 ' s reversible polymerase (BCR) DNA has been used as a key criterion for the Coved-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high rate of false negative consequences, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical forms of diagnosis (which no longer relies individually on RTBC) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in SARS' diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of history of illness, clinical appearances, laboratory tests, and radiation imaging discoveries is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use the Cresper-based Sherlock technique to discover Sars-Koff-2, and detects pieces of SARS-KAF-2 DNA at a rate of 20 x 10-18 Molly/L to 200 x 10-18 Molly/L (10-100 copies per microliter) using diaphragm in less than an hour without the need for precision devices.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if it is verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the new Corona virus, doctors are able to provide mainly supportive care for Koped-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed to treat other Corona viruses, such as Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These treatments include current and potential antiretroviral treatments, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and anti-virus vaccines.
Sars-Koff-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and to a lesser extent, it may also attack other organs that export the transgenic enzyme to neotensine 2, such as the digestive system, intestinal organs and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and failure are the most serious threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is necessary to mitigate symptoms and save lives, including general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, non-synthetic respirators, and artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms must be supported by ECM Oh, a life-threatening respiratory bypass technique used to treat heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and infection, and protecting vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-K-2 patients.
It is known that a cytokin storm results from an excessive immune reaction to SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokin storm is a form of systematic inflammation reaction characterized by the launch of a series of cytokines, including TNF, IL-1-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFN*, IFN {, IFN} and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free roots and are the main cause of acute respiratory stress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunisation inhibition is essential in the treatment of cytokin storms, especially for acute patients.
Stimulant hormones, tosilizomb, and an anti-Interlocine anti-selic antibody were used to treat cytokin storm.
Other cytokin immunosuppressants include modification of the immune reaction to T-cells; the IFN-1 and TNF blockade; the inhibition of Janos Kinaz; Plenatomump; the captain of Citokin 4 signals; and the Heston Disteliz inhibitors.
Stimulants and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, steroids with larger doses were not useful with severe lung injury in SARS and Coved-19 patients.
Instead, it has caused severe side effects, especially anemic osteoporosis, which has a severe impact on disease prediction.
Nevertheless, it was recommended that short cycles of activated hormones be used at doses ranging from small to medium-scale with caution for critical cases of Koed-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiretroviral treatment had been confirmed.
However, it has been discovered that giving Remedicifer, the equivalent of New Clementi, was effective with an American patient, Coved-19.
Remedicifer is an emerging viral antigen initially developed by Giliad to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Later, Remedicifer also showed potential discouragement to other single-chain reposic DNA viruses, including the Mers and SARS viruses.
Based on these viruses, Giliad introduced the compound to China to conduct some experiments on individuals infected with SARS-KOV-2, and the results are being looked forward to.
In addition, Parisitep, Interferon-Alpha, Lubinavir/Retunavir and Ripavirin were proposed as possible treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other reactions can occur after the combination of Plubinavir/Retunavir therapy.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and the generation of antibodies.
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (IG) produced by B-LB cells to control pathogens and other alien objects, and they recognize and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from Coved-19 and were injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by low inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to present this method for widespread use before specific remedies can be found.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, certain plasma-related defects have to be carefully taken into account.
For example, antibodies can induce an disproportionate immune reaction and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is likely to be life-threatening toxic.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treatment of patients in critical situations.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, insulation of B cells from recovered patients and identification of genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or examination of effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
That way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
Nevertheless, its effects depend heavily on a variety of multiple components in a formulation that varies according to the diagnosis of disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Most of the active components remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and verify or optimize their composition.
Currently, because of the lack of effective and specific treatment for code 19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those recovering from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of the Xu Feng Ji Do and the Lean Hwa King Win capsules for the treatment of Koffid-19 has been discovered.
The highest recovery rates were observed in the treatment of Coved-19 patients in several provinces in China, using traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of their patients, including Ganzo (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hobei Province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of Coved-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a very rough comparison, as many other influence factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Paulie Chang and his co-workers published a study to compare Western medicine treatment (W.M.) alone with common Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They discovered that the duration of recovery from high body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the GT+ traditional Chinese medicine group compared to the GTG group.
Most impressive, symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) were much lower in the GMT+C group than in the GTG only (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the GT+T group compared to the GTG only (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and integrity of traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting more well-thought-out experiments on larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to describe the procedure mechanism and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected of, or confirmed to have, been suspected of having been exposed to, code 19 are often very afraid of highly contagious disease and even fatal disease, and quarantined persons are bored, alone and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia resulting from activated hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric diseases including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotorization, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
As part of the public health responses to the Coved-19 outbreak, mandatory synth and quarantine tracking can make people more concerned and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to Koed-19 patients, suspected persons, persons involved, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on SARS-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct mixing.
Effective vaccines to cut the chain of transmission of HIV from animal repositories and infected humans to vulnerable hosts are essential and often complementary to antiretroviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines for the generation of neutral, effective, long-range and/or preventive anti-Sars-Koff antibodies.
Visible live vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body of older persons and models of the deadly challenge and their prevention of infection with an animal-based virus was not determined prior to the start of a clinical study.
Maybe it's because Sarse disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
Conversely, isolated cases and groups of Mers continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other areas because of the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
MIRS immunization strategies were developed using an inactive virus, DNA sub-oxygenic plasma, viral vectors, nano particles, viral-like particles and sub-units of synthetic protein, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against Sars-Koff-2 vulnerable individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge because of the length of time (an average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of the Corona viruses.
Coved-19, as an emerging disease, has just begun to show its full clinical path through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without a cure.
However, like Sars and Mers, Kovid 19 is also associated with high prevalence and mortality rates in severe patients.
Therefore, building a model of health-care agencies ' life expectancy is necessary to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the disease flow prospects of Coved-19 patients (table 33):
Age: The age was the most important factor for determining Sars' health prospects, which also applies to Coved-19.
The 30-65 age groups were mainly affected by code 19, with 47.7 per cent of these patients over 50 years of age in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were more vulnerable to underlying co-infections and complications and were much older than those who did not need them (at average age 66 to 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for the results of Koed-19 patients.
Sex: Sars-Koff-2 infected more men than women (0.31/10000 versus 0.27/10000), as explained above.
Accompanying diseases and complications: Coved-19 patients in need of intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and heart failure.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-KOV-2 could also be associated with the positive yellow cells with the angiotensin-transformed enzyme 2, which could lead to liver dysfunctions in the patients of Kofeed-19.
It should be noted that the underlying age and disease are strongly related and may overlap.
Unnatural laboratory results: The level of reaction protein C (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and it is suggested that it be a predictive factor for disease, treatment response, and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the level of the reaction protein C be linked to the severity of the C4D-19 disease and its life expectancy.
In addition, the high-precision enzyme of LDH, AST, ALT and CK could also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of functional imbalances in the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: breast scans and progress of clinical symptoms must be taken into account together with other problems to predict the results and multipliers of Kod-19.
Stimulant use: As explained above, stimulants are immunosuppressants commonly used as ancillary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Since the widespread use of high doses of stimulant hormones in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from vascular osteoporosis with life-long disabilities and poor quality of life.
Stimulants must therefore be used at a low dose and for a short period of time in the patients of Coved-19, if necessary.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the Kovid-19 outbreak, many patients suffered exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and their sick colleagues.
It is necessary to provide psychological counselling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, Covide 19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than Sarse.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory system, Sars-Koff-2 can replicate effectively in the upper respiratory system and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to the other Corona viruses that cause common cold.
Therefore, patients infected at the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of HIV during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-KOV transmission was considered to occur when patients were in a severe state of illness, while most HIV transmissions did not occur at the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of Coved-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, strenuous efforts are being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all residents in the hope of impeding Sars-Koff-2’s transition.
Although these measures have seriously affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the receding phase will continue for three to four months.
However, some other experts do not have the same level of optimism.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that Coved-19, which appears to be far more contagious than Sarse, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others have created a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and have suggested that Sars-Koff-2 may affect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-KOV-2 had been detected in mid-burn and throat surveys for patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that a newly detected virus could become a flu-like cyclical seizure.
Nevertheless, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, which suggests that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to 1 million injuries with half a million deaths.
Nevertheless, the disease was finally controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-KOV, SARS-KOV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappear or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the Covide-19 epidemic is given below (figure 55).
SARS-KOV-2 travels at a higher rate through cough or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with HIV-contaminated substances.
The virus has also been found in faeces, which raises a new possibility of moving from faeces to mouth.
According to a recent study of 138 cases, 41% of the cases may have resulted from hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health-care providers.
Considerable precautions are therefore needed to protect human beings, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even bystanders who have had contact with patients or injured persons.
Facial masks are the first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series 1860s) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to material surfaces, where they can be passed on to others.
However, N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) can only protect against inhaling small phoreons of between 10 and 80 nanometres, with only 5% of phoreons able to penetrate completely; SARS-K-2 SARS-KOV is about 85 nanometres in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, directly mixed health-care providers must wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers must wear appropriate insulation robes to further reduce communication with the virus.
The viruses can also infect someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a Dr. Saras-Koff-2 was injured even though he wore a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflammable eyes.
Therefore, health-care providers should also wear transparent face protections or glasses while working with patients.
For the general population in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more purified soap than usual, try to stay home for self-immolation and limit contact with potential injured individuals.
Three feet is an appropriate distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-KOV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its strong resemblance to SARS-Koff, as reported on January 7, 2020, would have caused a state of high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan did not reassure the citizens that the new virus had a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction.
This message severely reduced public preparedness, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest range in Wuhan.
China ' s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more cautious when issuing public statements because every word is important to citizens and can change their behaviour and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages than to try to reassure the public; and (4) more effective targeted training to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and periodically test and improve the community response system.
The Covide-19 outbreak from the new SARS-KOV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months across China and about 50 other countries worldwide at the time of writing these lines.
Given that the virus is very much like Sars-Koff and the symptoms are also similar between Coved-19 and Sars, the Koped-19 outbreak has given rise to a sense of repeated SARS infection.
Nevertheless, there are some notable differences between Koed-19 and Sars, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat the sick.
Coved-19 affects older individuals than young people and men more than women, and the rate of distress and mortality is also higher in older persons than in young people.
Sarse has a higher mortality rate than Koved-19 (10.91 per cent versus 1.44 per cent).
Coved-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do so when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of Kofeed-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why Sars-Koff-2 spreads much faster and wider than Sars-Koff.
The regular SARS-KOV-2 DNA test can be negative in some of the Cowed-19 patients.
On the other hand, infected patients can again be infected with the virus.
These results greatly increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
With this rapid progress in research around Koffid-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did Sars-Koff-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% genetic symmetry between Sars-Koff-2 and the similar Corona virus of Sars in bats, we still cannot conclude that Sars-Koff-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal was the intermediate that transferred the virus from the original host, like bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't efficiently stop the transition, and the outbreak can come back at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-KAF-2 is associated with anatomy-transformed anatomy 2, how exactly does the virus enter anaerobic cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also relate to the cells that are dispersing the enzyme converting to engyotensin 2 in the other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot conduct a rapid and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this plague last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, or will it fade like SARS, or will it come back periodically like a flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normality.
Animal assets of the Corona human viruses
The mutation and adaptation have led to the development of the corona viruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human krona viruses (human krona viruses) caused a mild disease, such as a cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has exposed the other side to the extent to which the infection with human Corona viruses can be severe and life-threatening.
The emergence of Sarse Koff-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 led to the re-emergence of the Corona viruses, and we were surprised at its rapid spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother Sars-Koff.
The Human Corona virus is an animal-based disease, so our understanding of the animal origins of the Corona viruses would serve us well.
Most of the human Corona viruses come from bats where they were not pathogenic.
I've also been known as the intermediate storage hosts of some human Corona viruses.
The identification of host animals is considered to have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Exploring the interactive relationships between the Corona virus and the animal host also provides an important insight into the emergence of the Corona virus in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available on the seven human viruses of Corona, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their animal assets and interspecies transmission.
The most important thing is that we compare and differentiate between the different human viruses of Corona from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the reshaping of the genome.
The disease caused by the current Corona virus epidemic of 2019 (Coved-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for the successful replacement of the host and the impact of the complications of HIV development on the severity of the disease.
Corona viruses belong to the coronary virus family, which includes a set of single-chained reposic DNA-coated viruses.
These viruses contain the largest genome of reposic DNA viruses, ranging from 26 to 32 kilos of base, and are called "televiruses" by that name because their composition is like the crown under the electronic microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, Corona viruses contain undivided genomes that share a similar organization.
Nearly two thirds of the genome contains two large open-reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into multiple proteins (pp1a and pp1ab).
Multiple proteins are treated additionally for the generation of 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open-reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), cover (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of Corona viruses also code a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, Corona viruses are classified into four types (the Corona Alpha virus, the Corona Beta virus, the Corona Gama virus and the Corona Delta virus), including the Corona Beta virus, which includes most of the Corona human viruses and is divided into four strains (a, b, c, d).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as a genetic origin for most of the Corona Alpha viruses and the Corona Beta viruses, while birds are the main repository of the Corona Gama viruses and the Corona Delta viruses.
Over thousands of years, Corona viruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as causes of serious human diseases.
So far, seven human krona viruses (human krona viruses) are known.
Among them is the Corona Human virus .229E and the Human Corona-NL63 virus, which belong to the Corona Alpha viruses.
The other five Corona Beta viruses include the Human Corona-OC43 virus, the Human Corona-HKU1 virus, the Corona virus associated with SARS-KOV, the Corona virus associated with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-KOV) and SARS Cove-2.
Human Corona .229E, Human Corona-OC43, Human Corona-HKU1 and Human Corona-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as cold, diarrhoea or both.
Conversely, SARS-Koff and Mirs-Koff and the newly identified virus SARS Cove-2 are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections to a larger number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and non-pneumoccal symptoms.
Isolated from the Human Corona-229E virus, the first strain B814, from nasal lesions of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Much information has been collected since then through intensive studies of the Human Corona-229E virus and the Human Corona-OC43 virus, which automatically heals their symptoms.
In fact, it was generally recognized that the infection with human Corona viruses was harmless until SARS spread.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most deadly epidemics in our present history, with 8,000 people infected with it, with an approximate death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MIRS) spreads, creating a persistent epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula, with scattered spreads to the rest of the world.
The new Corona Human virus is 2019 (the new Corona Human virus - 2019), renamed SARS Cove-2, the agent causing the current epidemic is the Corona virus 2019 (Coved-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm rings and the world has to prepare for the next SARS Cove-2 pandemic.
All seven of Corona's human viruses have animal origins of bats, rats, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the fact that the evolutionary origins of all human Corona viruses are bats, where viruses are well adapted, not pathogenic, but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The Covide-19 epidemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal assets of the Corona human viruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors of interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the warehouse, the intermediate host and the inflated host animal (the inflated host animals) of Sars Cove 2, with significant impacts to prevent future repercussions.
In this review, we provide an overview of animal assets, interspecies transmission, and the pathogens of Corona human viruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original viruses of the human Corona viruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural storage hosts but become pathogens after they move between species to a new host.
We are also reviewing the evaluation of the course of the Corona human virus, where the increase in its transmission potential is often accompanied by a reduction in the severity of the disease.
We are also discussing in this context the results of the current SARS Cove-2 outbreak.
Corona animal viruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the B814 strain of the Human Corona-229E virus from nasal lesions of cold patients, various types of Corona viruses were removed from various infected animals, including turkey, mice, cows, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven species of human Corona viruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the Human Corona virus in chronological order (table 1) would be educational and indicative.
The first strain of the Human Corona-229E virus was removed from the respiratory system for patients with upper respiratory infections in 1966, and then adapted to live in the ranks of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with the Human Corona-229E virus suffer from common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, dysentery, sore throat, fever, and coughing in approximately 10.2% of cases.
Later in 1967, the Human Corona-OC43 virus was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transfer was in the brains of the infant rats.
The clinical characteristics of the Corona-OC43 virus appear to be similar to those caused by the Corona-H229E virus, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
Both the Human Corona-229E virus and the Human Corona-OC43 virus have spread globally and tend to move during the winter season in moderate climate.
In general, the time of custody of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of disease for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with the Human Corona virus 229E caused a mild cold.
Only a few HIV-positive patients showed severe lower respiratory infection.
SARS, also known as "Atypical Pneumonia", is the first pandemic caused by the human Corona virus that is well documented in human history and its trigger is SARS-Koff, the third human Corona virus to be detected.
The first case of SARS is due to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed casualties and 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the superconductor, it was estimated that a single case could lead to almost two secondary cases, with a custody period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of the viral load on the 10th day of the disease.
Sars-Koff's symptoms begin to show muscle pain, headache, fever, urethra and chills, followed as late symptoms by difficulty breathing, coughing and respiratory distress.
The lack of lymphocytes, liver disorders, and the rise of creatine quinase are common laboratory disorders for SARS.
In SARS patients there is also widespread damage to anaemics, a proliferation of virtual cells, and an increase in the number of blind cells.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial breathing.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases, many organs can also be infected, including the digestive system, liver and kidney, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be particularly fatal in patients with HIV.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case of infection who travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, considerable efforts have been devoted to research on the Corona human virus.
The Human Corona-NL63 virus was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, it was found to be common in young children, older persons and HIV patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
The cold, convulsive inflammation, fever, and bronchitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the Human Corona-NL63 virus.
Another independent study described the isolation of the virus itself from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it's globally widespread.
It is estimated that the Human Corona-NL63 virus is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking in early summer, spring and winter.
The Human Corona-NL63 virus is associated with laryngitis, also known as strangulation.
In the same year, the human HKU1 virus was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-based pneumonia and bronchitis, HKU1 has been reported to be associated with the exacerbation of acute asthma.
HKU1 has been found to be globally widespread, causing mild respiratory diseases, similar to NL63, HK229E and HK43.
All four human Corona viruses acquired from society have adapted well to humans. In general, the probability of causing diseases with high prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence has occurred for unknown reasons, as in the rare case of the most vicious sub-type of the Human Corona-NL63 virus, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infection in China.
In general, when Corona viruses acquire this ability to move efficiently and keep themselves constantly within humans, they also become less severe or pathogenic.
Mirs-Koff was first removed in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the confirmed cases are laboratory-based from the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia cases have been reported from the outside and a rare secondary transfer of two close personal contacts.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by Mers are similar to those caused by Sarss, and are characterized by severe acute pneumonia.
Unlike Sars, many people with Mers have also suffered severe kidney failure, which is what Mers has distinguished from other diseases caused by the Corona virus.
More than 30% of patients suffer from infectious intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Mirs-Koff one of the most known destructive viruses of humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients were discovered that were later known to be the result of SARS Cove-2 infection in Wuhan, Hobei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current prevalence of lower respiratory infections due to the SARS Cove-2 virus as a public health emergency of international importance, as it has been called Covide-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a primary mortality rate of 3.4 per cent.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the province of Hobei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
Sarse Cove-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff, which appear in the form of fever, coughing and respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea also appears in some of the injured.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-KOV and SARS-KOV-2 are very similar because of the 82% great homogeneity of the nucleotides sequence, they belong to different branches of the strain evolution tree.
SARS COVE-2 appears to be less acute but more contagious than SARS-KOV and Mirs-KOV.
It has been reported that there are people with no symptoms despite being infected with SARS Cove-2 who may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and discrepancy between Sars Cove-2 and the other six Human Corona viruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First of all, Corona's human viruses are similar in the period of custody and the period of time of the disease.
In this regard, SARS Cove-2 follows the general trend of the six other human viruses of Corona.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of the Coved-19 infection falls between Sars-Koff and the four human viruses of Corona acquired from society (i.e., the Human Corona .229E virus, the Human Corona-OC43 virus, the Human Corona-HKU1 virus and the Human Corona-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS Cove-2 displays more common features in cases of human corona viruses acquired from society, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases with code 19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-KOV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS Cove-2’s transition shows interesting patterns of both human Corona viruses acquired from society and SARS-Koff.
On the one hand, SARS Cove-2 is at least as high as the human transmissibility of the Corona viruses acquired from society.
On the other hand, the verification of whether SARS Cove-2 transport is reduced after human transport remains as in the cases of SARS-Koff and Mirs-Koff.
Finally, SARS Cove-2 can be detected in excrement samples, as in other human Corona viruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether Sarse Cove-2’s movement from the oral anal route plays an important role, at least in the case of Sars-Koff.
It is interesting to see whether Sarse Cove-2 may show seasonal prevalence, as in cases of human Corona viruses acquired from society.
However, the features of SARS Cove-2, including the possibility of transition, and the mechanism of morbidity and sustainable spread after human transition, will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current Koed-19 outbreak.
All four human Corona viruses acquired from society and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
There is another perspective, which may also be true, that humans have adapted well to these four human Corona viruses.
In other words, they may both be survivors of the old Corona virus epidemics.
The human viruses of Corona, which cause severe diseases to human beings, as well as to humans who have contracted the acute diseases of the Corona human virus, have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the human viruses of Corona have to be replicated sufficiently in humans to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that face the limiting factors of the host.
From this logic, the longer SARS Cove-2 spreads and the more infected, the greater the opportunity to adapt fully to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop human transmission through quarantine or other anti-infection measures.
The four korona viruses acquired from society spread among human populations over many years, causing cold in people with good immunity.
These viruses don't need an animal warehouse.
On the contrary, Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff, who cause severe human morbidity, have not adapted well, and have not been able to continue to move among humans.
They need to stay in and reproduce in their animal reservoirs and then find the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and inflated hosts.
SARS COFF-2 has similar features to SARS-KOV/MERS-KOV and the four human viruses of Corona acquired from society.
It's as contagious as human Corona viruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes the disease more than human Corona viruses acquired from society and less than Sars-Koff or Mirs-Koff.
It is not yet clear whether they will be fully adapted to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or an intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the Corona human viruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, warehouse, intermediate and amplified hosts of the Corona human viruses.
The animal acts as the evolutionary host of the human krona virus if it harbours the closely related parent virus and shares a large symmetry in the sequences of nucleotides.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and undisturbed to this host.
Similarly, the repository hosts the human virus Corona on a continuous and long-term basis.
Either way, the hostesses are naturally infected and the natural hosts of the Human Corona virus or her father's virus.
On the contrary, if the human Corona virus enters a newly mediated host just before or near it attacks humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes ill health.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also serve as an inflated host by allowing the virus to be temporarily copied and thus transmitted to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
The infection of the human Corona virus may be at an impasse if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, Corona's human viruses can also adapt to an intermediate host that they may even settle for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with the prey.
The seroprevalence surveys then indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence rate of Sars-Koff IgG than ordinary people.
For the first time, the masked palm yogurt (Pagama Larvata) and the raccoon dog in the live animal markets were identified as carrying SARS-KOV-like viruses that were almost identical to Sars-Koff.
This indirectly supported the fact that no other cases of SARS were reported after all the yogurt cats were killed in the market.
However, it has been reported that the results of Sars-Koff ' s examination of masked palm yogurt living in the wild or on farms without exposure to the markets of living animals have been largely negative, indicating that the masked palm yogurt may be only an inflated middle host, but not the natural warehouse of Sars-Koff.
As 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guanzu have anti-Sars-Koff objects, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also serve as a powerful intermediate host for Sars-Koff is not ruled out.
Looks like all these are hosts who don't move Sars-Koff.
Later on, the search for Sars-Koff’s animal natural host led to the detection of the closely linked krona bat virus, called the Chinese red horse bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 (the Chinese red horse bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3), which is found in the Chinese horse’s shoe bats.
The result of the examination of SARS-KOV antibodies in these bats and the sequence of the Chinese horse-skin bat gene associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and the other krona bat viruses share a 88-92% symmetry of the nucleotide sequences with Sars-Koff.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Many krona-like viruses (Korona-like severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses) have been identified from bats, but none of them could be isolated as a living virus except for WIV1.
The human angiotensin 2-converted enzyme is defined as the future of Sars-Koff.
WIV1 extracted from a bat stool sample was found to be using an engyotencin 2-converted enzyme in the bat, yogurt cat, and humans as a receiver to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the vaccine recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the ability to match WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the most closely associated parent of SARS-KOV in bats, as they share a 95 percent symmetry of neoclytides.
Although these two viruses are very similar, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not SARS-KOV's direct father virus and that bats are not a direct warehouse host for SARS-KOV.
The analysis of the evolution of Mers-Koff strains is combined with the Corona-HKU4 virus in bats and the Corona-HKU5 virus in the same bats.
The Corona-HKU4 virus is used in bats and Mers-Koff is the host's own receiver, a bibutadial bibutadial peptidas4 (dibutadial peptidas 4), to enter the virus.
Polymerez DNA sequences based on Mires-Koff's reposic DNA are closer to the evolution of strains than the Corona Beta viruses in the bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mirs-Koff lives in wild bats.
Mirs-Koff and the HKU25 virus share bats that are closest to it in just 87% of the nucleotide sequences.
Thus, the host bats may not be the direct warehouse of Mers-Koff.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-single camels are positive for the anti-equitable bodies of Mirs-Koff, as well as the camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Mirs-Koff, a human-compatible neighborhood, was isolated from the snob scans of the single-single camels, suggesting that the camels serve as host to the original warehouse of Mirs-Koff.
It should also be noted that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels that were experimentally infected with Mirs-Koff, but a massive viral dispersion was observed.
Infected camels were spreading viruses noticeably not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the main route to spreading the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions because many confirmed cases of Mers have no history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, and these cases have been logically attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown modes of transport involving unidentified species of animals sheltering Mirs-Koff.
Sarse Cove-2 shares the RTG13 virus in isolated bats from horsepower bats in 96.2 per cent neoclytide symmetry.
The difference in sequence between Sars Cove-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of Sars-Koff and Mers-Koff.
This means that bats may not be the host(s) of SARS Cove-2's direct warehouse unless Corona's bat viruses are found almost identical in the future.
SARS Cove-2 intermediate host animals are assumed to be among the species of wild animals sold and killed in Wuhan Marine Foods Market, with which many initial cases of Coved-19 have been associated, indicating possible animal-to-human transmission.
Many recent studies based on the metagenomy sequence suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as Manis javanica could also accommodate the native Corona Beta viruses associated with Sars Kauf-2.
The genes of the new Corona virus for this ant eater and SARS Cove-2 share the symmetry of the nucleotides by 85-92%.
However, they are closely associated with RaTG13, about 90% at the level of nucleotide sequences.
They are clustered in two sub-lines of CF-2-like viruses in the strain development tree, one of which shares a similar (receiver) interface with SARS Cove-2 with a 97.4% amino acid sequence match.
In stark contrast, the areas where the receivers connect to SARS Cove-2 differ significantly from RaTG13, although the overall sequence of the genome is higher.
A previous study of a sick ant eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which were similarly found to be associated with Sars Kauf-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual treatment to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of a virus genome of approximately 86.3% length.
We can't rule out the possibility that an ant eater is an intermediate host animal for SARS Cove-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that the ant eater is the direct origin of SARS Cove-2 due to the different sequence between SARS Cove-2 and the Corona Beta viruses associated with SARS Cove-2 in the ant eater.
In addition, the distance between Sarse Cove-2 and RaTG13 is less than the distance between Sars Cove-2 and the Corona Beta viruses associated with Sars Cove-2 in ant-eating.
The evolutionary path of Sars Kauf-2 in bats, ant-eating and other mammals is still being identified.
While the highest sequenced symmetry was found in the areas of futures connection between Sarse Cove-2 and engraved ant eaters, Corona Beta viruses associated with Sars Cove-2 and Sars Cove-2 and RaTG13 share the highest symmetry of the entire genome sequence.
A predominant speculation is that the high degree of similarity between the areas of Sars Cove-2 receivers in the eater of turbos from the Corona Beta and Sars Cove-2 viruses is driven by selective convergence.
There is a counterproposal that is likely to be recombined between Sars Cove-2 in the eater of turbo ants belonging to the Corona Beta virus and RaTG13 in the third wild species.
Restructuring is widespread among the Corona Beta viruses as a driving force for development.
The direct animal origin of SARS Cove-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to the highly pathogenic human viruses of Corona, the animal origin of the Corona human virus 229E, the Human Corona-OC43 virus, the Human Corona-NL63 virus and the Human Corona-HKU1 virus were also studied.
Evidence of the evolution of strains has indicated that both the Human Corona-NL63 virus and the Human Corona-229E virus may have originated from the Corona Bat virus, while the father's viruses of the Human Corona-OC43 virus and the Human Corona-HKU1 virus were found in rodents.
It has been reported that the Corona virus in bats called ARCov-2 (Aplace Highlands Corona virus) discovered in North America's tricolour bats is closely related to the Human Corona-NL63 virus.
On the other hand, the Human Corona-229E virus was found to be genetically linked to another Corona virus in bats, called Hepposideros/Ghanakwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and it was suspected that the amphibians were also its intermediate host.
To illustrate, the current information on the animal origins of the human Corona viruses known in figure 1 and table 2 has been summarized.
An analysis of the evolution of strains has provided evidence of transgenic transmissions of Corona viruses across species throughout history.
When the Human Corona-OC43 virus crossed species to infect humans with household livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of the transgenic transmission of the Human Corona-229E virus among species is still less clear.
Corona Alpha viruses in bats were found to be closely related to the Human Corona-229E virus.
There's an Alpha Corona virus in the Alpaca.
Many evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpaca, may have contact with bats in a common environmental home.
While humans have close contact with the Alabama.
Second, the Human Corona-229E virus of the Corona Alpha viruses is in multiple bats and not pathogenic in bats, while the Corona Alpha virus of the Alpaca causes respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the corona-alpha virus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the Alpaca has been infected with the Human Corona-229E virus of the Corona Alpha virus.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause human diseases, including rabies, Ebola, Nebah, and Hendra.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats may transmit the human virus of Corona-229E directly to humans.
While the Corona Alpha viruses in bats act as a gene pool for the Human Corona-229E virus, alpaca and the single camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in Mirs-Koff.
Mirs-Koff gives an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single camels and from single camels to humans.
Mers-Koff's evolutionary origin has been defined from bats since the beginning of their identification and has also been enhanced through subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of viruses to exchange genetic pieces within one species and their transmission between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying capacity, all of which are favourable conditions for making them an ideal “virus distributor”.
On the other hand, Mirs-Koff has moved to the lonely camels for decades.
It was well adapted to these camels until it turned from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Mirs-Koff causes a very minor disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence and humans are an untransported host to Myers-Koff, where his transport cannot continue.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transport of Mirs-Koff, the role of ant-eaters, if any, in the transport of Sarse Cove-2 is different.
In particular, the Corona Beta viruses associated with ant-eaters make him very sick.
They may be non-transporting hosts for Sars Cove-2 viruses belonging to the Corona Beta virus, as in the case of Sars-Koff.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities for Sars Cove-2 to move between species of animals to humans by either proving them or excluding them.
First of all, bats may be host to a virus repository linked to SARS Cove-2, which is mostly identical to SARS Cove-2.
Humans and bats may share environmental habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, an abrasion eater can be one of the intermediate amplifiers of the virus associated with the recently discovered Sars Kauf-2.
Humans are infected by the slaughter and consumption of prey meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be exposed to C-2.
A survey of antibodies in pets and wild animals is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, there may have been a recombination and adaptation of Sars Kauf-2 in a third species with contact with bats and ant-food.
The search for the animal origin of Sars Kauf-2 is still ongoing.
Regardless of the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three key factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of Corona viruses to overcome species barriers.
First of all, her mutation rates are relatively high in the doubling of rebuzzi DNA.
The estimated Krona virus mutation rates, compared to other mono-chained DNA viruses, can be considered “medium” or “high” with an average turnover rate of ~10.4 replacements per year for site 2, depending on the Krona virus adaptation phase to new hosts.
Corona viruses include an external corrective rebunculose enzyme, the deletion of which leads to extremely high mutagenic or developmental variability.
Interestingly, the remedicifer is known for its ability to suppress the Corona virus through inhibition of external repocholyase enzyme and repolymerase DNA based on reposi DNA.
Rimdicifer is one of the anti-Sars Cove factors to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutations of the Corona viruses is about a million times higher than the rate of hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when Corona viruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The rate of mutations for SARS Cove-2 is markedly low when compared to SARS-Koff with a high rate of transformation, which indicates a higher level of human adaptation.
It seems he's already adapted to another near-human host.
In addition to Sarse Cove-2, this also applies to Mirs-Koff, who has adapted well to the one-single camels.
In theory, genetic deviance is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist Sars K-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the large DNA genome in the Corona viruses actively provides an additional dosage in mutation modification and reconstruction, thereby increasing the probability of interspecies development, which serves to create new Corona viruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by unique, abundant open-reading templates and coded protein functions near the end of 3% for the genome.
Third, Corona viruses change the templates randomly and repeatedly through replicating the reposi DNA through the unique "selection of copies" mechanism.
In a host that's like a blending vessel, the sequence change occurs frequently during the copying of the DNA of the Corona virus.
High-symmetric, fully long and secondary genomic nuclear acids may reconstruct the generation of new Corona viruses.
A special evidence of the evolution of strains has been discovered for the natural recomposition of the HKU1-HKU1-HOC43-Korona-human virus, as well as animal Corona viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus in bats and the HKU9 in bats.
The interaction of the virus with the host associated with the transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor influencing inter-species transmission.
In this regard, we take SARS-KOV's recombination as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transport incidents.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated samples of Sars-Koff in humans and yogurt cats, Sars-Koff was thought to be undergoing rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations in the field of protein-surveillance.
In general, the field of connection of the protein S to the Corona virus interacts with the cellular receiver and is selected extensively through the anti-host response.
In SARS-KOV, receivers are associated with amino acids from 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with the re-transformed enzyme of engiotensine 2 as well as the auxiliary receivers for entering the virus.
SARS-KOV's area of association is capable of identifying the NGO2-converted enzyme receivers in various animals, including bats, yogurt cat, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only the remains of six amino acids were observed that were different from the viral isolated samples of humans and the yogurt cat in the receiver connection, and four of them were found in the future sequence to react to the future of the enzymoncinin-transformed enzyme 2.
K479N and S487T mutations are found in SARS-KOV's association in the yogurt cat, which can increase the probability of the reaction of the Spike protein in the future of the human enzymonesine 2-convertive enzyme.
In other words, these two types of amino acid alternatives may be critical to human viral adaptation.
It should be noted that Sarse Cove-2 shares the same cellular receiver as Sars-Koff.
There is a 30% difference between Sarse Cove-2 and Sars-Koff in the S1 unit of Protein S, which implies that the probability of the protein's association with the human enzymoncincinin 2 transformer enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study in the super-cold electronic microscope indicated that there was a higher probability of 10 to 20 times as high as this correlation compared to that between the human agiotencin-2 and the protein S in Sars-Koff.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receiver may be necessary for Sarse Cove-2 to move.
It's also interesting that the Human Corona-NL63 virus is also associated with the re-transformed enzyme of enogenesis 2 but in a different part of protein s.
There are many other human krona virus receivers, such as the protein analytics of the chlorohuman virus 229E and the sialic acid of 9-O human krona virus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these Corona viruses in humans after moving between species of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receivers, the result of inter-species transmission of human krona viruses is also controlled by other factors of dependency and host constraints.
The complexity of these host proteins between humans and natural repository hosts of Corona viruses, such as bats, single camels and rodents, may constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human Corona viruses need to control the host's reliability factors and weaken the host's limitations to implement a successful inter-species transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of HIV interaction with the host remain detectable and identifiable.
The wide and unbiased examination of the genome can be used to examine the reliability and host restraints of Sars Cove-2 using the advanced Cresper technique.
The emergence of emerging Corona human viruses: back to the starting point
The diversity of Corona viruses in bats offers ample opportunities for emerging Corona viruses.
From this logic, Corona viruses in bats are a genetic pool of Corona human viruses.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of the human Corona virus and are important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein encryption genes has the potential to significantly modify viral apparent patterns.
Among the organizational proteins of Sars-Koff, ORF8 was thought to be important for human adaptation, with SARS-Koff being isolated from viruses in bats but found to be encrypting different ORF8 proteins.
It was found that the 29 properties of the removal of sars-coff nucleotide were found to exist in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that fosters the replacement of hosts.
In addition, Sars-Koff has a history of possible recombination through the strains of the Corona Alpha and Jama viruses, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in polymerase.
Reconstruction sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In a similar way, research has shown that the Mirs-Koff epidemic has seen recombinations between different strains, which occurred in the single-single camels of Saudi Arabia.
In addition to Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff, recombination cases were also observed in other Corona human viruses, where the Corona human viruses were installed with other Corona animal viruses in their non-building genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely to result from the release of viruses from selective pressures, such as those caused by the host's immune system.
The loss of a fully long ORF4 protein in the strain of the apparent pattern of the Human Corona-229E virus due to the removal of two neolytides is an example of these effects.
Although the proper ORF4 can be observed in camel viruses and bats associated with the Human Corona-229E virus, the alpha Corona virus infects the single neolytide alpaca, leading to the mutation of the tyre.
Last but not least, the evolution of the new Corona viruses is also driven by selective pressure in their own storage hosts.
Unsurveillance or mild symptoms were detected only when bats were infected with Corona viruses, indicating mutual adaptation of the Corona viruses and bats.
She showed that the bats adapted appropriately to Corona's anatomical and physiological viruses.
For example, the activation of the pro-inflammation response in bats has been reduced by the efficacy of the pathogens caused by the Corona viruses.
In addition, natural killer cellular activity in bats has been suppressed by the increased rate of inhibiting NKG2/CD94 cell receiver and the low level of expression of the main tissue compatibility compound type I.
Furthermore, the high level of interactive oxygen species (reactive oxygen compounds) resulting from high metabolism of bats can lead to both the inhibition of the Corona virus and the effect of correction by external reponoclease, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains may arise from the Corona virus by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human krona viruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Corona viruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in storage hosts such as bats and camels.
They copy hard without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why HIV-positive people do not show symptoms and the causes of acute cases of human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by excess immune response activity and a cytokin storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the contrary, in the case of non-stereopathological carriers, the immune response is separated from the copying of the Corona virus.
A similar immune response separation strategy may have beneficial effects on SARS Cove-2 antitherapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the use of interferon type I may be used at least in the first stage of the infection with the cascad-2 in humans.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental reasoning, the inhibition of the CCR3 by the CN950 inhibitor is useful in the treatment of Cowed-19.
The emergence of Sarse Cove-2 follows the general idea that Sars-Koff and Mirs-Koff have evolved.
At the time it was discovered that the Corona Beta virus in the bats shared 95% neoclytide homogeneity, there was also the Corona virus in the bats sharing 96% neoclytide homogeneity with Sarse Cove-2.
While it was discovered that butter cats and other animals on the market harboured similar viruses to SARS-KOV, they did not discover the intermediate direct hosts of SARS Cove-2.
Corona Beta viruses have been detected in anatomy, which is very much homogenous with Sarse Cove-2, indicating that anatomy animals may be an intermediate host or that Corona Beta viruses in an anatomy have contributed genetic cutting, leading to the final release of SARS Cove-2.
Although the questions are still being asked, there is no evidence that Sarse Cove-2 is man-made neither intentionally nor by accident.
Corona viruses have returned to focus because of the recent outbreak of SARS Cove-2.
The study of the Corona viruses in bats and other animals has greatly changed our idea of the importance of animal-based disease origins and the animal repositories of the Corona human viruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that Sars-Koff, Mers-Koff and Sars-Koff-2 all originate from the bat and move to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that SARS-KOV infection originated from contact between man and yogurt cats on the market, the closure of markets for fresh products and the killing of yogurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same mental sense, ant-eating animals should be disposed of from fresh product markets to prevent the transmission of the animal-origin disease, in light of the discovery of multiple strains of the Corona Beta viruses in the ant-eater, which are very close to Sarse Cove-2.
However, whether or not Sarse Cove-2 has moved to humans, as well as in whatever way, through ant-eating animals and other mammals, his transmission remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mirs-Koff was found in the lonely camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local citizens.
It is widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa region.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control Mers, as officials in China's wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of Sars-Koff and Sars-Koff-2.
In order to stop the repeated outbreaks of Meres, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective anti-Meres-Koff vaccines for camels, as well as other anti-infection actions.
Because we can't eliminate these viruses once and for all, new genetic patterns can emerge and cause outbreaks.
There is a variety of Corona viruses associated with animal-based diseases in wildlife.
In particular, Corona viruses are very diverse in bats with the potential to cause animal-origin diseases.
There are many opportunities for the development and recombination of Corona viruses associated with animal-based diseases, leading to new, more transferable and/or deadly viruses in humans in the future.
A culture of wildlife consumption should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the light of the plight of mankind caused by Sars, Mers and Coved-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be developed.
The truth is that many viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread and spread.
Although bats carry many of the characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to move away from them.
The continuous monitoring of mammals is a necessary measure to gain a better understanding of the environment of the Corona viruses and their natural hosts, which proves to be useful in preventing their transmission from animals to human beings and preventing future appearances.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-origin viral diseases is to keep humans away from the environmental location of natural repositories of animal-origin viruses.
The mystery of the animal origin of the disease is still surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the original virus of Sars Cove-2 to the ant eater, it is important to know what conditions exist for the sharing of bats and ant eater animals with the same environmental location.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of disease to humans, then the way people communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammals serves as the true intermediate host, then it should be explained how they interact with different species, including humans, bats and ant-eating.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS Cove-2, both monitoring and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether the host is a bat, an ant eater or other mammals, it is expected to identify Sarse Cove-2 or the parent viruses from which it is subdivided, which are almost identical in their future natural hosts.
Continued research in this area will reveal the evolutionary path of Sars Kauf-2 in animals, with important actions to prevent and combat Koped-19 in humans.
Need to update the “suspect case” and “confirmed case” standard when diagnosing the incidence of Cowed-19 disease
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of the new Corona virus 2019 (the new Corona virus 2019), which provided our experience and included appropriate reference information to combat the pandemic worldwide.
Although the Corona 2019 (Coved-19) virus is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this speech, we responded to a comment on our guidance and presented the latest diagnostic criteria, namely a “suspect case” and a “confirmed case”, which is in accordance with the latest Coved-19 Diagnostic and Treatment (Seventh edition) Guidelines of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Corona virus of 2019 (the new Corona virus of 2019), now officially known as the Corona virus of 2019 (Coved-19), became known as the Corona II virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described Koed-19 as the pandemic.
To combat SARS Cove's infection, our team drafted and published a fast-track guidance on the Internet in the Municipal Medical Research magazine of February 6, 2020.
He's had a lot of attention since his release.
Please note that, although Cowed-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, the Coved-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn) produced seven overall issues with some contexts fundamentally changed.
Our guidance has now been answered by a comment from Cho et al., who made a simple suggestion for grade monitoring based on clinical experience.
Their efforts have added a new guidebook to our guidance and have become a valuable reference for this pandemic all over the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest Coved-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Pilot) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of the suspected case requires a combination of any of the characteristics of the epidemic pathological history and two clinical appearances in order to arrive at a comprehensive analysis, or three clinical appearances in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: 1) includes a date of travel to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities reported to have been infected with Coved-19, or to reside in it, during the last 14 days before symptoms began; 2) a date of communication with SARS Cove-2 cases (with positive results of DNA testing); 3) a date of communication with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city, surrounding areas or other communities reported to have been infected with Coved 19 during the last 14 days before symptoms began; 4) a date of communication with a group of confirmed cases (2 or more cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical appearances: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with properties that are proven by the photographic examination of Koed-19 infection; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells at a normal, low or low level in the early onset of infection.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be based on the suspected case involving any of the elements of evidence of pathogens or blood serum reactions as follows: (1) positive as a result of the real-time BCR test of Sars Cove-2; (2) the high consistency of the entire viral genome sequence with the known emerging properties of the Corona viruses; (3) positive results of the IgM and IgG-specific antibody tests of Sars Cove-2 in the serum; or the change of the IgG-specific antibody of Sars Cove-2 from negative to positive, or that the high standard in the recovery phase is more than four times that level in the acute phase.
We see that a real-time sequenced polymerase reaction test for DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to version 2 (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The detection of pathogens in the blood sample was added to version 4 (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then the blood serum reaction manual was added to version 7.
These adjustments have relied on the ongoing work of researchers to arrive at the design of an ideal tool kit for DNA detection for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of respiratory behaviour, including blood samples, which has increased the availability of different samples and supported the transfer of the positive result of the anti-genetic object to confirmed case standards.
Besides, there is growing evidence to be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and unsurpassed cases.
Therefore, the content of the information flow scheme for Cho et al. should be updated, with a person without clinical symptoms classified as “low risk”.
The grade monitoring system also needs to be validated in additional clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to have more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose the “suspect situation” and the “confirmed situation”, we call for tracking and compliance with the latest guidance from home countries.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh is recording five new deaths due to Koed-19, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to Cowed-19 on that day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, 114 registered cases were active and 33 were house-based.
17 deaths were recorded.
At an online press conference, the Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, stated that the deaths involved four males and one females.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases aged over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case aged between 41 and 50.
She also said that two deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared Cowed-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official of the Anatolia Agency Hospital, a local news agency, said that one of the deceased was Jalal Sif Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was being cared for at Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
In an online video statement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges said that public transport would stop longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The disruption of public transport began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of commodities, namely, medical products, fuel and food, continues to be permitted.
The first cases of Koved-19 in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March, with two persons returning from Italy, as well as one of their wives.
The three have already recovered by March 19th.
The number of SARS Cove-2 cases has exceeded 2 million worldwide.
The data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of the severe acute acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove II) virus was over 1 million worldwide.
Coved-19's virus-induced disease caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of the Corona virus, with the first associated death recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, on Thursday, it was one of the few countries still free from the Corona virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced 1051635 confirmed cases, as of yesterday, of which 79332 were in the 24 hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European time (0000 hours UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of the Corona virus were recorded in the United States of America, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, according to Johns Hopkins University data, reported over 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by the Corona virus infection.
States around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Mr. Sergei Sobianin, Mayor of Moscow, announced that the city would be closed until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that salaries would continue to be paid to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, 10 abstentions and 1 vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Makkah al-Mukarramah and Al-Munura to the day; it was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand intends to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mr. Mike de Wayne, announced that the state extended the stay at home until 1 May.
Australia ' s stores reduce the purchase of toilet paper per transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evening, the Australian Wal-Worths and Coles series stressed the restrictions on purchasing toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Wal-Worths and one roll of Coles stores for each transaction in all branches nationwide.
I also identified Aldi's stores for one roll, on Monday.
These procurement restrictions were published as messages at the pay points in the supermarket chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have stored them because of concerns about the disease of Coved-19 in case people need self-segregation.
On Wednesday, Wal-Wortz approved restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to become one roll for each purchase order.
These changes followed the previous restrictions adopted by Wallworths on March 4 and Coles on March 5 by allowing only four rolls to be purchased for each transaction.
In its information statement of 8 March, Kools stated that, despite the application of the four-package restrictions, “many shops still sell everything they have within one hour of receiving it”, and the application was described as “unprecedented”, as well as by Aldi's stores in a Facebook publication on Tuesday as “unexpected”.
Sales increased "a lot" last week, according to the spokesman for Wallworths.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the quantity allowed to be purchased was two rolls.
In order to alleviate the shortage, Coles asked suppliers for larger rolls and the pace of delivery increased, and Wal-Wortz asked for additional stock, while Alde made available its stock for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailer Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of the delivery of trucks made it difficult.
Production costs are expected to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few private offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi's stores announced that as a result of the early availability of stock, some stores would not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
According to Dr. Gary Mortimer, retailer at Queensland University of Technology, in a report on News.com.au, stores are filled every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper was a large commodity, resulting in a reduction in stock in numbers, and when sold in full, large empty spaces were left on the shelves, reinforcing the feeling of shortage.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman stated: “Coles and Wallworths have a view that if there is a lot of goods on the shelves and if products such as latrine wrappers and sterilizers can be [purchased] and supplied in large quantities, it may reduce panic.”
The company Who Geves a Crab, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that its stock was depleted.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Klinks toilet napkins, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent napkins, confirmed that they were working 24/7 to continue to supply their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some real estate sellers provided free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily publication in Darwin City, included eight-page advertisements that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
The shops initially hesitated about restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, where they stated that they did not have plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there was also a great demand for other products, including muzzles, steroids, dried goods, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store named Okado identified the purchases of toilet paper by Andrés with two cans of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announces that Covide 19 is a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the continued outbreak of Coffide-19 - a disease caused by the Corona virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and known as SARS Cove-2 - reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word “emergency” refers only to the extent of the disease and not to the seriousness of specific situations, WHO has noted the need for Governments to take the necessary measures:
“All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tidros Adhanom Gebresus, said: “If countries discover, test, treat, isolate, track, and mobilize people to confront.”
"We are all very concerned by the alarming levels of proliferation and danger as well as alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, Director of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus has been traced from the beginning of its appearance to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu."
Gepresus expressed a similar view: “We have never been exposed to an epidemic caused by a Corona virus”.
Continue: "We've never seen a controlled pandemic at the same time."
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the decision of the World Health Organization (WHO) in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Sensitivity and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fouchy, said about the outbreak: “In short, things will get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of Coffide-19 around the world on Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The Corona 2019-20 virus pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of the Corona 2019 (Coved-19), caused by the Corona 2 virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove 2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases were reported in 19 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China’s mortality rate was estimated at 4%, while worldwide it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and respiratory distress.
Symptoms may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There's no known vaccine or specific antiretroviral treatment.
The basic treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Preventive measures recommended include hand washing, oral coughing coverage, maintenance of interpersonal spacing, monitoring and self-segregation of suspected infected persons.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk controls and closure of installations.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a large-scale shortage of supplies exacerbated by the panic of procurement.
Schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world’s students.
Misinformation about HIV has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and South-East Asian origin and appearance, and other areas where significant HIV infections have emerged.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities of Wuhan City (Hoby District Capital) of China reported a series of cases of pneumonia for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are often associated with a weak market for seafood for wholesale sale, and therefore the virus is believed to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS Cove-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely linked to the Corona viruses in bats, the Corona viruses in the ant eaters, and Sars-Koff. It was later discovered that the first person who showed symptoms contracted the disease on December 1, 2019, and this person had no clear contact with the later discovered wet market group.
Of the number of early cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the morning newspaper South China indicated that a case dating back to November 17, 2019, 55 years old from Hoby County, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that, although new cases in China had declined, they had suddenly risen in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a significant underreporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By February 26, a relatively small number of cases were reported among young people, with 19-year-olds and under-aged adults accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of British people needed to be infected before the effective herd was immune.
Cases indicate the number of persons who have been examined by Koed-19, and their injuries have been confirmed in accordance with the official protocols.
As of March 23, no country tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries had formal policies on not testing only for those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of the cases of code 19 were not detected in China, and that these unregistered injuries were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistical analysis estimates published on March 30 indicate that the number of casualties in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) of Covede-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with code 19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the period from symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, Covide 19 caused about 97,000 deaths.
As of February 5, about 80% of deaths in China were concentrated in those over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official statistics on deaths due to the Koed-19 pandemic generally indicate those who died who were confirmed to have been infected with a code of ethics.
The real number of deaths from Kofeed-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without being tested -- for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Koved deaths recorded by a factor of 4.5x.
The spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States admitted that “we know that [the number of reported deaths] reflects a lower estimate of reality,” a statement supported by narrative reports indicating inaccuracies in the United States. Such underestimation occurs in case of pandemics; such as the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009, the first confirmed death in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
It was the first death outside the mainland of China on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia on February 14, in France.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside China’s mainland in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than 40 countries and territories reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health-care system, treatment options and time taken from the onset of the outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and public health. The mortality-injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204), as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of casualty mortality fell from 17.3% (for those who showed symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those who showed symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures point to the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who died from disease, and the EFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those who are infected (and those who are not) who die from disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame and follow a specific population from injury to fate.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain population groups.
The Oxford University Evidence-based Medicine Centre estimates that the overall epidemic mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test of Coved-19 in Germany, and with a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on the estimates of the mortality rate of cases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary according to location.
Massage Bonnie of Pennsylvania State University stated: “The outbreak of infectious diseases that are left uncontrollably uncontrollable usually peaks and begins to decline thereafter when no host is available.
But it's almost impossible to reach any logical expectation now about the timing of that.”
China's Chief Medical Adviser Chung Nanshan stated that “it could end by June” if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kocharski of the London School of Hygiene and Heat Medicine stated that Sarse Cove-2 would be “probably deployed for a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College of London under the supervision of the world, Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical spacing and other measures “to make a vaccine available (perhaps 18 months or more).
William Shafner, Vanderbilt University, said, "I think this Corona virus is unlikely to disappear completely -- because it's easily transferable, and it may turn into a seasonal disease -- so that it returns every year."
The viciousness of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of transformation.
Coved-19's symptoms may be relatively indeterminate and may not show symptoms for the infected.
The two most common displays are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory pygmosis, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, throat inflammation, headaches, chills, vomiting, blood blowing, diarrhoea, or glaucoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) asserts that nearly one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has limited the symptoms to respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, face or lips. Immediate medical attention is advised if such symptoms appear.
Some patients, who do not have clinical symptoms but whose injuries are confirmed by the results of the analysis, may not show symptoms, so specialists have advised that mixed persons must be closely monitored and tested to exclude the injury.
Chinese estimates of the incidence of no symptoms range from a few to 44%.
The usual period of custody (between injury and symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the proportion of people with code 19 who initially lost a sense of smell was estimated at 30% and recently fell to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spread are still under consideration.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during mixing or through spray spatter at coughing, sneezing or speaking; at mixing 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without oral coverage may result in spraying from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some see that the virus may also be transmitted by long-term air spray, which may be produced in the course of speaking. It may also produce respiratory spray during the process of exhale, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
Sprays may fall on the mouths or noses of persons close to them or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as CBR intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory discharges to be released as spray and thus cause spread by air.
It may also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from faeces to mouth, that risk is thought to be limited.
China’s government denied the possibility of Sars Kauf-2’s transmission from faeces to mouth. The virus is more infected during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People were found to be infected up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating the possibility of transmission before severe symptoms.
There are few reports of cases without laboratory confirmed symptoms, but no symptoms have been identified by some countries during MT surveys.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECCDC) asserts that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can go from two to three in general.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polyproplin) and stainless steel type 304, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, this is different based on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, yet British authorities recommend handwashing after mixing animals, as is the case with contact to other surfaces that may have been touched by an injured person.
Corona II, associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove-2), is an emerging virus, where three people with mixed pneumonia were first isolated from a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, where its protective membrane is melted. SARS Cove-2 is closely associated with the original SARS Cove virus.
It's believed to have animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the Corona virus meets genetically with the Corona Beta virus race, and falls under the subsex of the Corona Sarpee virus (b strain) in addition to two strains of bats.
96% of the entire genome is consistent with other samples of Corona viruses in bats.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between the viruses originating from the ant eater and the viruses originating from man.
A comparison of the entire genome to date has resulted in the discovery of at most 92% of the genetics of the Corona virus for the eater of engraved ants and the SARS Cove virus, which is not enough to prove that ant eater is the intermediate provider of this virus.
HIV infection can be diagnosed temporarily on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed by the reaction of the RRT-PCR in sequence to the infected avatars or computerized CT scan.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing polymorphosis to computerized CT showed that computerized arterial imaging was more sensitive than sequenced polymorphosis, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American Radiography College recommends that "no computerized CT scans be used to detect Coved-19 or considered a primary diagnosis."
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several protocols for testing the SARC-2 DNA for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of the RRT-BCR series in real time.
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally carried out by means of a nasal float, and can also be used by a socket from the throat. A number of laboratories and companies develop serum tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them proved sufficiently accurate to be widely used.
A serum test developed by Selix has been certified for emergency use in the United States in approved laboratories only.
The X-ray and CT characteristics of people with symptoms of disease include an asymmetric end-velocity such as a classified glass mist and a distorted crystal leachate.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Radiography without a polymorphic reaction is a limited procedure for the detection of Cowed-19; it interferes with other diseases such as the infection of the gland virus.
A large study in China compared the results of the computerized chest CT scan to the chain reaction of polymorphisms and demonstrated that although the imaging is less accurate in terms of evidence of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it is considered a screening tool in endemic areas.
Artificial IQ-based aerobic networks have been developed to detect the properties of HIV imaging in both radiograms and computerized CAT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief at coughing or sneezing and then disposing of it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those already infected were advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical separation is also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spread throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they were infected. Health-care providers, who take care of a potentially infected person, are advised to use reasonable measures, mix precautions, and eye protection.
The use by Governments of GPS data for tracking raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
Many mobile phone applications were designed or launched for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups worked to find privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has been found to have been infected with code 19. Misperceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, mouthwashing of nose and glue is not a viable solution.
There is as yet no vaccine for Coved-19, although many organizations have been working on the production of a vaccine.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the dirt appears on the hands, before eating, after the nose, cough, or sneeze.
That's because home soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
CDC also recommended using a hand sterilizer containing at least 60% alcohol when water and soap are not available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of the disinfectant on the surface of stainless steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodophodone 0.2–7.5%.
There are other disinfectants, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexadine glucone, with less efficacy.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have been injured in an office or care centre, all places such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and ATMs used by the patient must be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either bend the elbow and put it in front of the mouth and nose or use a handkerchief and dispose of any napkins immediately.
It is recommended that those likely to be injured by the use of medical masks be reduced by the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when dispersed due to speech, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “the mask of [persons]’ desire to touch their faces can be reduced, which is a major source of infection in the event that the hands are not properly cleaned.” It is recommended that those who take care of people who may be infected with the disease should use masks.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are exposed to high risk of infection, such as those who care for people with code 19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made out of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks, especially in the case of mixing people (1 m (3 feet) or less) directly.
It recommends that Hong Kong wear a medical mask when using public transport or stay in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited access to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has required anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel asked the entire population to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks every day since mid-March, demanded that passengers on trains and inter-city transport buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama made it necessary to wear a face mask when exiting, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social spacing (also known as physical spacing) includes measures to combat infection that aim to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing individual mixing.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social separation methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically separating from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social spacing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of assemblies recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 persons (if there is no outbreak of Coved-19 in the region) to 50 persons and 10 later.
Older persons and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure, and weak immune systems face an increased risk of serious diseases and complications and have been advised by CDC to stay at home as much as possible in inter-community outbreaks. In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the term “social distance” with the term “physical distance,” explaining that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either hypothetically or remotely.
The use of the term “social distance” has led to the suggestion that people should be in complete social isolation, rather than being encouraged to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health directives for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with a person with whom she lives who is not HIV-positive or suffering from symptoms.
Self-segregation is recommended in the home for those affected by Coved-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-segregation, which have been imposed or recommended by several governments for all people living in affected areas.
The most powerful quarantine instructions have been issued to those most at risk.
Those who have dealt with a person with code 19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or area where the infection is widely transmitted are advised to be quarantined for 14 days from another time.
The strategies for controlling the spread of the disease are containment or control and reduction of spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as introducing other measures to combat infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health-care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be undertaken at the same time.
Control requires more stringent measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of outbreaks of infectious diseases attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, as the epidemic curve is known.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and saves more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that may address the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand-cleaning, wearing masks, and self-immolation; community actions aimed at physical separation, such as closing schools and cancelling major gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced group tests and local quarantine, and issued notifications on casualty movements.
Singapore has provided financial support to those who have isolated themselves and imposed substantial fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized the acquisition of medical supplies. The simulations of the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (delaying rather than halting the spread of the epidemic) and curbing (reverse to the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce the peak demand for health care by 2/3 and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strains of health systems.
Curbing may be preferable, but it must be preserved as long as the virus spreads in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if first done), as on the other hand, the transition is quickly reversed when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for Coved-19, but development efforts are ongoing, including testing of existing medicines.
The use of treatments for unpredicted colds, fluids and rest may help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of stimulants may exacerbate the results.
Many pre-approved compounds for treatment of other viral diseases are subject to testing for use in the Coffid-19 treatment.
The World Health Organization (WHO) also stated that some “traditional and home-based treatments” could provide mitigation of the symptoms caused by Sars Coved-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health-care centres to provide for the needs of the Coed-19 patients was described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as essential measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health-care services for the transfer of resources at multiple levels, including the concentration of laboratory services on the Koved-19 test, the elimination of optional procedures wherever possible, the separation and isolation of people with code 19, increased intensive care capacity through staff training and increased number of artificial respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories as to where the first case arose (so-called patient 0).
The first known case of the new Corona virus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hobei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of the Corona virus in Hobei has gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to Wuhan’s wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus came from one of these species of animals; in other words, it has animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on 26 December and was dealt with by Dr. Zhang Jesian at Hobei County Hospital, which reported to the Jianghan Bohan Center for Disease Control on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of the Corona-like virus SARS.
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Lee Win Liang, to spread false rumours, and another female doctor, Iven, was reprimanded by her superiors to raise the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and reported to WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia unknown to the Wuhan health authorities were reported, prompting the investigation to begin in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transmitted to other Chinese provinces, with the help of movements during China’s New Year’s New Year and to Kwon Wuhan as a transit centre and the intersection point of the main railway lines.
On January 20, China reported approximately 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Schengen.
As of March 26, the United States exceeded China and Italy by the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 dead and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories registered at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or closure) and curfews. As of April 2, close to 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were subjected to a form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million were closed in the Philippines, some 59 million were closed in South Africa, and 1.3 billion were closed in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were subjected to one form of closure, which rose to 2.6 billion two days later — about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of Coved-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jishian observed a series of cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on 26 December, and her hospital subsequently reported to the Center for Disease Control in Jianghan Bohan on 27 December.
An initial genetic test of patients' samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a sarce-like Corona virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31st.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed on the same day.
With these notices in place, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police about "dissemination of rumours" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of a person-to-person move.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
As described as the “largest quarantine in human history”, a health cordon was declared on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, extending to a total of 15 cities in Hobei, affecting some 57 million people.
Private vehicles were banned in the city.
New Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hooshinchan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built after that, Lishchinshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also transformed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as conference centres and playgrounds, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government took other measures to contain the Koved-19 outbreak, including health announcements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed both inside and outside Hobei.
Public transportation has been modified, and museums have been temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement has been controlled in several cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been subjected to one form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, the Chinese authorities took firm action to prevent the virus from being “reduced” from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine on all those returning to the city from other countries. On March 23, one case was transferred locally to mainland China over the past five days, by a passenger returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, China’s State Council President Li Qi Qiang announced that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of outbreaks in China had declined.
Travel restrictions in Hobei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28th, with no specific details as to when this policy would end.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and introduced a corporate monetary stimulus package. The State Council announced a three-minute mourning day on April 4 at 10:00, in conjunction with the Qing Ming Festival, although the central government called on families to show respect online for their physical distance to avoid a re-emergence of Koed-19.
Koffid-19 was confirmed to have moved from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daeju of a new religious movement known as the Shinchiungi Church of Jesus.
It was suspected that Shinxiungi's followers visiting Daeju from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people, or about 13% of the 9.336 church followers, reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of preparedness on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All south Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were infected with the virus.
South Korea applied a program that was considered the largest and best organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected person, and trace and quarantine their mixture.
The screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile phone application, testing of people in their cars with test results available the following day, and increasing testing capabilities to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program represents a success in controlling the outbreak, although quarantine has not been applied to entire cities. At first, South Korean society was divided around President Moon Jae In’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either calling for the isolation of Mon, alleging the Government ' s ill-treatment of the outbreak, or applauding its response.
On March 23, South Korea was declared to have had the lowest overall cases in one day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that, as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries for assistance in testing the virus.
Iran reported the first confirmed case of SARS-K-2 virus on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early actions announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be removed.
Plans to limit inter-city travel were announced in March, although heavy inter-city traffic continued before the new Persian year Noroz.
The Shia shrines remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China.
In the midst of allegations of Iran’s cover-up, more than a dozen countries tracked Iran’s cases from February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak might exceed the 388 reported by the Iranian government to date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly HIV-positive on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch demanded that Iranian prison authorities release human rights defenders detained for peaceful opposition unconditionally, and that they also release qualified prisoners temporarily.
She stated that there was a high risk of HIV prevalence in enclosed settings such as detention centres, which also lacked adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and former government officials died of the disease by 17 March.
By March 23, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes due to the Corona virus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be five times what has been reported.
It is also believed that US sanctions against Iran may affect the financial capacity of the state to respond to the spread of the virus.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for the alleviation of economic sanctions against the States most affected by this pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak in Italy was confirmed on January 31, when the tests of Sars-Koff-2 Chinese tourists in Rome came positive.
The situation has begun to increase sharply, prompting the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of Kovid-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on February 21. On February 22, the Cabinet announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté said, "There will be no access to or exit from the outbreak areas.
On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, where deaths in Italy were 100 cases.
All major sporting events, including first-class football tournaments, were scheduled to be held behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sports events were suspended entirely for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered a halt to almost all commercial activities, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthetics, Housing, Recovery, and Intensive Care (SIARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy outdone China as the country with the highest number of deaths associated with the Corona virus in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths due to the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, confirmed cases amounted to 128,948, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardia region.
The CNN report noted that a combination of a large number of older persons and the inability to test all people living with HIV to date in Italy may have contributed to high mortality.
The UK’s response to HIV was first shown as the most relaxed among the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social separation or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticized for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to public fears. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising that unnecessary travel or social mix-up should be avoided, suggesting that people should work from home to the extent possible and avoid a number of places, such as bars, restaurants, and theatres.
On March 20, the government announced that it would close down all recreational facilities such as bars and gymnasiums as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers’ wages up to £2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in times of crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced more stringent social-separation measures, banning assemblies for more than two people and restricting travel and activity outside the home except as strictly necessary.
In contrast to previous measures, these restrictions have been implemented by the police through the issuance of fines and the separation of assemblies.
Most companies have been ordered to close, with the exception of “necessary” businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of the Coffide-19 virus was confirmed in Washington, Northwest Pacific, for a returning man from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Task Force against the Corona virus was set up on January 29.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the leading public health institute of the U.S. government — announced that it had developed its own test set.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the test, blocking the real extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test was corrupted by a flawed test group produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval of non-governmental test groups (by academia, companies, hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (the doctor’s order was required thereafter).
By February 27, Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, Associated Press stated: “Many people who suffered symptoms and had a doctor’s order waited hours or days for the test.”

As of March 15, many companies have closed down or reduced their working hours across the United States in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic was confirmed in all 50 states and in Columbia County. On March 23, 10,700 cases of the Corona virus were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said that social divergence seemed to have been successful, with estimates showing a slower doubling of cases from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died of the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of the Corona virus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend the social separation directives until April 30.
On the same day, the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths due to the Corona virus within 24 hours.
In the state of New York, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling the circulation of news by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications on HIV with the office of Vice President Mike Pence.
Trump's management of the crisis was not entirely well received, as it created widespread polarization among the parties.
Some United States officials and commentators criticized the United States ' reliance on importing essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
Analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and forecast deployment patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei had the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as high-profile destinations for passengers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least able of more than 20 grass-roots destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered to be the most capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the emerging Corona virus (Covid-19) on February 7.
Much had not yet been discovered about the Coved-19 virus, and Australia would place emphasis on border control and communications in its response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Given the impact of effective quarantine on Wuhan and Hobei, several countries have planned to evacuate their nationals and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with permits provided by the Chinese authorities.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan the evacuation of their nationals.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would clear the Americans on board the cruise ship Diamond Princes.
On February 21, a plane landed at Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from Diamond Prince.
In early March, the Indian government began to evacuate its citizens from Iran. On March 14, a South African airliner aircraft chartered by the South African government returned 112 South Africans.
A pre-departure medical examination was conducted, and four southern Africans with signs of the Corona virus were left to mitigate risks.
South Africans were returned whose test results were only negative.
The results of the test showed that South Africans, including flight crews, pilots, hotel staff, police, and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom, as a precautionary measure, remained under surveillance and quarantine at Ranch Resort for 14 days, were not injured.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On February 5, the Chinese Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent assistance to China.
Some Chinese students at US universities joined forces to send assistance to China’s HIV-infected areas, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago region reportedly sent 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hoby County on January 30. The Humanitarian Aid Organization, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and hospital clothing, via the Air Emergency Bridge, to Wuhan Union Hospital by January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates pledged $100 million to WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, along with the protection of “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia”.

After the situation in China stabilized, the country was sending assistance to various countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the spread of the Corona virus.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits, which were distributed by the African Union.
Later, 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five respirators were sent to Panama.
Canada also donated medical supplies. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits for China’s Corona virus, which was only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 60,000 face masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable facial masks that were believed to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed good Chinese aid. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of the blackout that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided “systematic updates to avoid panic before the new lunar New Year holiday”.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities’ decision to apply the ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) noted that while this was “not certainly a recommendation of WHO”, it was “a very important indicator of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is heavily concentrated” and described it as “unprecedented in the history of public health.” On 30 January, after confirming the transition from one person to another outside China, and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEAC), the sixth public health emergency of international concern since this measure was first introduced during the 2009 pig flu pandemic.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that considering outbreaks as a public health emergency a matter of international concern was due to “the global risk of proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tydros stated that “there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds in low-income countries, noting the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people living with HIV, even if they appear”.
Tydros also made statements declaring that “our strength is measured by the power of our weakest person” and urging the international community to “invest today or pay a high price later.” On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the disease, at a press conference, Coved-19.
On the same day, Tidros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “the full response potential of the United Nations system”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team has been set up, allowing for the coordination of the entire United Nations response, and WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while the experience of other agencies can be used to learn about the social, economic and broader development impacts of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was prepared with China to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in local governance and assess “the severity of the disease and its transmission” by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess “the impact of district and city-level response activities, including in urban and rural areas.” On 25 February, WHO announced that “the world should do more to prepare for the potential Corona virus pandemic,” noting that it was premature to describe it as a pandemic, but that States should be “in the state of preparedness.”
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that global assessment of the Corona virus threat would rise from “high” to “very high,” its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "This is a real test for every government on Earth: so we have to be prepared.
This virus may be on its way and you must prepare for it, and urge that the right response measures be taken that can help the world avoid "worst."
Ryan also stated that current data do not justify public health officials declaring the disease as a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means that “we basically accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus.”
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced an outbreak of a virus corona as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that “WHO is deeply concerned about alarming levels of prevalence and severity, and worrying levels of inaction.” WHO faced severe criticism of what is perceived as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including delays in declaring a public health emergency, and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The violent reactions included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adham to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of every individual during the Covide-19 pandemic.
The Group of Experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not justify discrimination against a particular group.
Experts emphasized that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons belonging to minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extremely poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups requiring government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the Coffeed-19 crisis.
OECD has launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
One of the policies of strengthening health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions is the digital hub, which includes a State policy tracking tool, aimed at helping countries learn from each other and facilitating a coordinated global response to the Corona virus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Goff, and Edward Paulsonaro, the son of Brazil's President Geir Bolsonaru, for her handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hobei.
A number of CCP managers have been dismissed at a cross-sectoral level for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, indicating dissatisfaction with the political institution ' s response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that this move was aimed at protecting the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public resentment over the spread of the Corona virus.
Some Chinese officials, for example Chao Lijean, rejected an earlier admission that the spread of the Corona virus had begun in Wuhan, in favour of the conspiracy theories alleged by the United States or Italy with regard to the Coffide-19 virus.
The United States administration of Donald Trump described the Corona virus as a “Chinese virus” or “Wohan virus”, saying that China “implemented a news blackout that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic”, which some critics criticized as racist and distracting from its management's failure to contain the disease.
Dili Best obtained a U.S. government telegram reviewing the communication scheme with clear sources in the NSC, with a strategy stating that "everything is about China.
We were asked to pursue and disseminate these messages in any way we could, including press conferences and television appearances. “New sources such as Politico, Fortin Polisi and Bloomberg claimed that China’s efforts to send assistance to HIV-affected countries were part of my advocacy for global influence.
The EU Foreign Policy Officer Joseph Burrell warned of the existence of a “geographic political component that includes a struggle for influence through circumvention and generosity policies”.
Burrell also said, “China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and trusted partner.”
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela, and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of transferring aid to other countries to their countries.
There were masks disputes reported between other States, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the Corona virus.
Mauritsu Masari, Ambassador of Italy to the European Union, said that “China has responded only bilaterally.
Sure, that's not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, following a telephone call to Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conté, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military paramedics, special clearance vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stamba reported an unnamed "high-level political source" that 80% of Russia's aid was "nil or low-interest to Italy."
The source accused Russia of initiating a remarkable “geographical and diplomatic” attack.
The President of Lombardi, Atilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi de Mayo, denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitry Pskov said that “when providing assistance to his American colleagues, Putin assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials activate again, they will also be able to repay the favor if necessary”.
NATO's planned military exercises, the 2020 guns, will take place in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the cold war on a small scale.
“In the current public-health crisis, training endangers not only the lives of troops from the US and many participating European countries, but also the populations of the countries in which they are to be conducted.” The Iranian government has been severely affected by HIV, with some 20 MPs and 15 other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country was struggling to fight the spread of the disease because of lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak triggered calls for the US to adopt social policies that are common in other rich countries, including comprehensive health care, comprehensive childcare, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could have a negative impact on Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated because of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's “indistinct and negative quarantine efforts” after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae In’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Mon to be isolated because they claimed that the Government had mishandled the outbreak or praised its response. The pandemic allowed States to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed fears that this might allow Governments to tighten their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Victor Urban to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament as well as elections and to punish those who spread false information about the virus and the Government's handling of the crisis.
The outbreak of the Corona virus has been blamed, which has led to numerous shortages of supplies due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic procurement and the disruption of factory operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the suspension of suppliers.
Many areas have also seen panic buying, which has left shelves free of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing shortages of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warned against delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adham, the demand for personal protection tools has increased 100 times.
This demand caused prices to rise by up to 20 times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed by between four and six months.
It also caused a lack of personal protection tools worldwide, warning WHO that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the widespread prevalence of Koed-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, followed by high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
The actions taken by China and Italy to combat the storage of and illicit trafficking in vital products have successfully avoided the severe food shortage expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not experienced a significant decline in its agricultural production, but prices may rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan City, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: according to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 by government actions to reduce the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Given that China’s mainland is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been noted that the spread of the virus poses a major destabilizing threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agatha Demares expected the Economist Intelligence Unit to keep the markets volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerged.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by over $300 billion, which could last until two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have experienced “disorder” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
World equity markets declined on February 24 due to a significant rise in the number of cases of Coved-19 outside the mainland of China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the spread of the Corona virus, several United States equity indicators, including NASDAK-100, Standard and Poor 500, and the average industrial Dow Jones has fallen the largest since 2008, with Dow 1,191 points, the largest decline in a single day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indicators ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoob Rattings GMH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
The stocks retreated again due to the fears of the Corona virus, the largest decline on March 16.
Many believe that economic stagnation is possible.
Economist Mohamed Al-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks respond faster than they did with the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights because of low demand, including British Airlines, East China Airlines, and Kansas, while the British Regional Aviation Company, Flight B, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports have been closed as well.
The epidemic coincided with the spring season known as Cunyun, the main travel season associated with the New Chinese New Year's holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of large crowds, including New Year’s celebrations, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many events of the new lunar year and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the forbidden city of Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of the 31 counties, in municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended New Year’s Holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year’s celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East retailers have seen a fall between 50% and 60%.
This also led to a 33% to 43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to check shoppers’ temperature, and elimination of efficiencies. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC), the recession caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more than they would have suffered without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior, or in Hoby County. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The closure in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) unemployed. The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers on government-supported short-term business plans known as Korzarbet.
France and Britain have adopted a short-term German employment compensation scheme.
The theatre arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which affected the operations of organizations as well as individuals - workers and independents - globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector have sought to support their mission (mostly funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, to preserve the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, around the world to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance places and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and presentations cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Among other recent accelerating repercussions of the disease, religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows, have been abolished.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which took place during the last week of Christian repentance season in Great Toma.
Many congregations of Christian elders have recommended staying at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available on radio, on-line or television, while others worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic diocese in Rome of its churches and church chapels, and the evacuation of St. Peter’s Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and Gordwara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak, after which the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their inhabitants to the holy places in Mecca and the city.
This pandemic has caused the biggest disruption in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the European Champions League 2019-20, the Super League 2019-20, the European League 2020, the American Professional Basketball League season 2019-20, and the National Hockey League 2019-20.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event “will be rescheduled beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021.” Gambling clubs and other playgrounds around the world were closed and direct gambling tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with different musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
A lot of big theaters like those on Broadway hung up on all the shows, too.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional direct performances, such as live broadcasting parties or the creation of online “festivities” for artists to perform, distribute and disseminate their work.
Many Internet features of the Corona virus have been posted on the Internet, where many have turned into humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of Covide-19, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against persons of Chinese and East Asian origin and against persons from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports released in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserved the virus or received what was alleged to be justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hobei reported discrimination on the basis of their territorial origin.
There was support for Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in HIV-affected areas.
After the outbreak in new hot spots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of code 19, may be skeptical and xenophobic. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions for pressure to prevent Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, Hashtag ChinseDuntComToJaban#Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racial violations, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the Corona virus as a “Chinese virus,” a term that critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
The demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from north-east India, which shares the border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, have been harassed by the spread of the Corona virus.
The head of the BJP unit in West Bengal state, Dileep Ghosh, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and “that is why God avenged them.”
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned these statements, calling them “wrong.” In China, the pandemic led to increased xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners described as “foreign garbage” and targeted for “disposal.”
Many newspapers have removed subscription-driven pages for some or all of their coverage of the Corona virus.
Many scientific publishers have made the scientific papers on the outbreak available for open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on pre-print servers such as BioRxiv.

The laboratory test for the 2019 (Coved-19) and associated SARS-KOV-2 respiratory virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus where antibodies produced in response to infection are identified.
RTBC confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where the DNA of the Corona virus is detected.
This test is accurate and designed only for the detection of the DNA of SARS-K-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibodies detection is used for diagnosis and population control.
Antibody tests show the number of people infected, including those whose symptoms were too simple to report or who did not show symptoms.
The precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined based on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on HIV prevalence in its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a great difference in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This disparity is also likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
RRT-BCR can be used to test respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including nasal bulimia or pygmy.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
RTBC, which is performed using throat scans, is only used in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat afterwards while continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
For injured persons examined in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken by cipher catheter or use cough (pilm).
One of the early PCR tests was created in Charts in Berlin in January 2020 with the use of the RRT-PCR PV reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PowerChek Coronavirus detection kit for SARS-2 suitable for safe clinical use and based on BCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to have obtained emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-2 detection crew based on BCR. In the United States, CDCs distribute their own diagnostic plate of the new Corona 2019 virus.
One of the three genetic tests in the old versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one of the test stages was delayed in the CDC in Atlanta; this led to the completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and government and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing until then.
The Department of Food and Drug Control approved testing under an emergency authorization for use. US commercial laboratories started testing early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of the Coffide-19 test across the country based on RTBC.
Similarly, the Quest Diagnostix allowed the Coffide-19 test across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; the sampling and processing process must be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Research Centre for Virus Science and Biotechnology created and produced Victor Coved-19.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health-Care Supervisory Authority recorded the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Klinek had developed a test to detect Coved-19’s infection.
On March 19, 2020, the Department of Food and Medicine granted emergency use permission (EEUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on the M2000 Abbott system; previously, the Department of Food and Drug had granted a similar permit to Lab Corp and Thirmo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sivid obtained a similar emergency permission from the Food and Drug Administration for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA agreed to a test that uses the technology to magnify equal-temperature DNA instead of BCR.
Since this does not require a series of consecutive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Taiwan expects to increase manufacturing to conduct 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test using a single-crete antibodies especially associated with the new Corona virus protein protein, hoping to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that “thoracic rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT [computer CT] may be clear even before symptoms appear”.
The typical properties that appear in computerized CT include binary-segregated glass floats with an oceanic, asymmetric and backward distribution.
Underside spread develops, showing irregular patches and intensifying as the disease develops.
A study in the city of Wuhan comparing BCR and computerized CT with respect to the origin of the current pandemic indicated that computerized CT was more sensitive than BCR, although less accurate, with many of its photographic properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American Radiography College recommends “no use of computerized CT scans to detect Coved-19 or treat it as a primary diagnosis.” In March 2020, CDC recommends the use of PCR for initial testing.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect individual injuries during a period starting from 7 days or after symptoms, to determine immune potential, and in the case of population surveillance, analyses can be performed at CLT central laboratories or through the testing of the clinical care point (BCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of ambient blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to follow up on the immune response.
For the clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually withdrawn by the skin puncture.
Unlike PCR, the extraction step does not need to be taken before testing. On March 26, 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that had notified the agency in accordance with the requirements and thus were able to distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, the Food and Drug Department adopted only one test under its emergency authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European credits for their test crews, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test completes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral DNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the infection began. In April, the UK discovered that the antibodies test crews it purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan whereby patients suspected of being infected can stay at home, “give the emergency department a sample tube to patients,” spit in the tube, and return it back to get the test results after a simple period. The British National Health Services has announced that it is experimenting with a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of infection from the injured when they come to hospital or the need to sterilize the used ambulance.
In Germany, on March 2, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said that it had been able to conduct about 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and that 10,700 people had been tested last week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance if the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 weekly tests.
On March 19, intra-car HIV testing was made available in several major cities.
On March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only the results of positive cases were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that, starting from the calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been tested by the end of the week 12/2020, and the results of 33,491 positive (6.9%) positive samples of SARS-KOV-2. In Israel, brain researchers and Rembam hospital devised a method to test samples from 64 patients at the same time, by collecting samples and not conducting further tests until the sample was found to be positive.
With Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, supervising construction work and taking five days into it, modelling exercises showed that the cases in Hobei would have increased by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capacity had not been completed.
Wuhan's laboratory immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenjin, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai and in 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays produced open-source and multi-transmitted designs that can test up to 1122 samples of a patient to detect Kofeed-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, the shortage and inadequacy of reagents caused trouble when a large number of tests were conducted in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that would contain a sample heating rate of 98°C (208° Fahrenheit) for five minutes to release the reposi DNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was at the top of the world’s population in terms of testing the Corona virus, and was on the way to raising the test level to most of the population.
This was through a combination of activation of in-car testing capability, and the purchase of a high-productivity laboratory with a range suitable for the population from Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories Huo-Yan in China).
The laboratory was established within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of tests of RTBC to be performed daily, the world’s first laboratory of this size to operate outside China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the genetic characteristics of the Corona virus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German crew industry plan, which is sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying the tests available in the US. China and the US faced problems regarding the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide adequate kits to meet demand and follow the test recommendations of health experts.
In contrast, experts have stated that the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new Corona virus.
The South Korean government has significantly enhanced testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for the intensification of testing programmes as the ideal solution for reducing the progress of the Coffide-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus has caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be accumulated in private American laboratories, and the supply of scans and chemical detectors has been scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test crews.
In the US, “deficits” were found in CDC test crews; the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented the test in particular. Spain purchased test crews from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioacy Biotechnology Limited, but found the results inaccurate.
PIC explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect the samples or to improper use of the crews.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would reverse the purchase of the crews that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test crews from Shinzhen Bioasi. 80% of the test crews purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results.
Prime Minister Matovich suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Professor Ach Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that the test crews purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and “prevented their use.”
The tests, followed by a quarantine for those who were found injured and those who were infected with SARS-KOV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which witnessed the first death of Coved-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, which took about 10 days at a time.
Nearly half of the people tested positive did not show symptoms, and all detected cases were removed.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new injuries were completely eliminated.
Singapore’s Corona 2020 pandemic has seen a significant decline in prevalence relative to other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retailing facilities; through strict tracking of mixtures and restrictions on internal travel, testing, and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun to urge residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened on March 23 on time after the break.
Several other States have also taken control of the pandemic through strict tracking of mixtures and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have conducted more tests than deaths have much lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect only those with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience with Coffide-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of Coffid-19 to one of the 16 laboratories accredited by WHO to confirm testing.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next graph, the column “positive by % of tests” is influenced by the policy of the state in conducting the test.
The State that tests only persons transferred to the hospital will have positive cases that are about a percentage higher than the State that tests the entire population, whether or not they appear to have symptoms, considering that the other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand cleaning, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing garbage, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The continuous washing of hands with soap at certain “necessary times” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. mucous membranes).
It includes the five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child’s ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, before preparing food or dealing with meat or raw fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends that the hands be washed:
Before the food is prepared, during, and after.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning it up after using it for the toilet.
After you clean your nose, or cough, or sneeze.
After touching animals, or their feeds, or their waste.
The hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Handwashing before medication or medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of handwashing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important measure for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, the Corona virus and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrhoeal infectious diseases and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduction of infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates for respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced through simple behavioural changes, such as hand-washing with soap.
This simple measure can reduce mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing from diarrhoea can be reduced by approximately one third, similar to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Hand-washing with soap is the only most effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when automatic behaviour is applied in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million deaths a year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by about a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (water, sanitation and hygiene).
It also protects handwashing from herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
The simple harmful effect of handwashing is that repeated handwashing can result in skin damage due to its drying.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peeling and itching known as eczema or hand skin inflammation, which is particularly common among health-care workers.
Too often handwashing is also seen as one of the symptoms of OCD.
There are five necessary moments during the day when hand-washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bathroom (pee, poop), after cleaning the baby's ass (puppet change), before feeding the child, before eating, before/after preparing food or dealing with meat, fish, or raw poultry.
The correct hand-washing method should be exercised in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after the treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or dealing with animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-washing with soap is low.
A study on hand-washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent, the US approaching the middle by 77 percent, and China by 23 percent.
The “Basic Health Care Programme” implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of widespread action to promote children's health and education.
The treatment of worms twice a year, as well as the daily hand-washing of soap and the daily dental cleaning of fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soap or detergents to water enhances the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergents is to reduce decomposition barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin disinfectant because fat and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not easily degraded in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to disinfect...
Because of its reusable nature, steel soap may carry bacteria from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transport from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transport is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to provide that “liquid soap is preferred from devices that operate without contact to pump soap”.
Antibacterial soap has been widely promoted to health-related consumers.
So far, there is no evidence that the recommended use of disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as Triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of living organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap doesn't affect antibiotic strains, it may not be as effective as it is being marketed.
Apart from the surface stress reduction and the skin protection factor, advanced formulations may contain acids (Acetic acid, Ascorbic acid, Lactic acid) as an acid regulator and active anti-microbial benzoic acid and other skin refreshments (solids, vitamins, ethanol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that regular soap is as effective as bacterial soap in the consumer category, which contains triclosan in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water to wash hands isn't hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural soil and bacterial oils.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A disinfectant or hand sterilizer is a substance that is not water-based to clean hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners that are sterilized through hips (also known as handwash with alcohol composition, purified handwash or hand sterilizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of them depend on the alcohol of isopropyl or compound ethanol with a heating agent such as carbomir (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or humid like glycerine in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and reduction of the impact of alcohol-induced drought.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sterilizers containing alcohol are effectively considered to be at least 60% to 95% microbicide.
Alcoholic steroids across the hip eliminate bacteria, drug-resistant multibacteria (golden cluster coils resistant to methicillin and intestinal combinations resistant to funcomicin), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory-free virus, nasal viruses, effusion, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic sterilizers containing 70% alcohol via fermentation consume 99.97% (a 3.5 reduction in logarithmic, similar to a 35-minute reduction in decibel) of the bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after their placement and 99.99% to 99.999% (a 4-5 reduction in logarithmic) of the bacteria on the hands 1 minute after their placement. Hand sterilizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcoholic hand sterilizers are almost completely ineffective against NOVs, the most common cause of infection-induced stomach and intestinal inflammation. Enough manual purgatory or alcohol scrubbing must be used to wet or fully cover both hands.
The front and back are rubbed to the hands and all the fingers and limbs for approximately 30 seconds until the fluid, foam, or gel is dry.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand-washing with hand sterilizers, especially when hands are clearly dirty.
The increasing use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should only be an alternative to washing the right hands if water and soap are not available.
The repeated use of alcohol sterilizers can cause the skin to dry unless the rain or skin refreshments, or both, are added to the formulation.
The effect of alcohol on the dryness of the skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other rain or both to the formulation.
Clinical experiments have shown that alcohol sterilizers containing abscesses cause skin irritation and dryness less than soap or anti-microbial detergents.
Sensitivity skin inflammation, pneumocococcal syndrome, alcohol hypersensitization or additives in handwashers are rare.
The low incidence of irritant skin inflammation has become a pull factor compared to the washing of hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water-based detergents do not cleanse hands of organic material, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sterilizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, where pathogens remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sterilizer depends heavily on components and composition, and historically, its effect has been markedly less than that of alcohol, which depends on alcohol rubs.
Recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and continuous anti-microbial effect after use, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive reverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dust or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ashes are also, like soap, a disinfectant because they form an alkaline solution when they touch water.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The correct hand-washing method recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
The use of running water is recommended because existing basins may be contaminated, while water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
I make foam on the hands by rubbing them with a plentiful amount of soap, including the back of the hands and between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rubry creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes the rub for longer periods of more germs.
Rinse well under the running water.
The rinsing of hands inside the pelvis may lead to repollution.
Dry with a clean towel or leave it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail paint may contain microorganisms.
Lushin is often recommended for use as a moisturizer to prevent drying of hands, and dry skin can cause damage, which may increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate handwashing in developing countries, where tap water or soap are not available, or both, such as pouring water from a hanging vessel or pruning appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as “tibi tap” and other low-cost options.
Tibby's tap is a simple technique that uses a needle hanging from a rope, and a foot-to-foot control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
An increasing number of research shows that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, under the auspices of the European Textile Symposium for Paper towels, to compare cleanliness levels provided by paper towels, warm air hand dryers and fresher jet air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase, on average, on the inside of the fingers by 194% and on the palm of the hand by 254%.
The drying using the jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and on the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing hands and drying them with a paper towel, on average the total number of bacteria on the bottom of the fingers decreased by 76% and on the palm of the hand by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a risk of infection for other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
Jet air dryer, which drives air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 miles per hour), is capable of inflating microorganisms from the hands and the device, and may be infecting other bathroom users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms about 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwilt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes in bacterial numbers were observed after drying of hands:
There's a lot of different hand dryers, and I compared hand dryers to paper towels.
Handwashing with hand sterilizer napkins is an alternative while travelling due to lack of soap and water.
The alcohol sterilizer must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory for a long time after Hungarian doctors discovered the effectiveness (1846) of disease prevention in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands as soon as they're forgotten.
One study found low prevalence rates.
The medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, using large amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hand.
The hands must be rubbed together and the fingers tangled.
If there's crap under the fingernails, a rough-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Given that germs may stay in the water on the hands, it's important to wash them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids the contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in a health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bes") and to avoid their transfer.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, not washing hands is still at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to wash their hands routinely before touching patients, thus moving microorganisms.
One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow by 66 per cent, and WHO published a newspaper explaining how to wash hands and rub them in the health-care sectors.
The draft guidance document for the clean hands provided by the organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the cleanness of hands, if required to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five moments to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before a sterilisation mission,
The addition of disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicine" or "antimicrobial") gives an exterminator an exterminator.
This element of extermination may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When “bringing” one’s hands to perform surgery, a tap that can be operated and stopped without contact with the hands, some chlorhexane or iodine washing, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, a sterile scrub brush, and another sterile tool to clean under nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and hands up to the elbow, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
Long scrubs (10 minutes) are not necessary.
On the rinse, the water must be prevented from recoiling from the hand-to-hand.
After the handwashing is done, the hands dry off a sterile cloth and wear a surgical dress.
In order to limit the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use a hand disinfectant before and after taking care of a sick person.
The greatest benefit of manual cleansing was found to have come from the first 20% of laundry, and it gained a very small additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to more than 35%.
Normal soap washing results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases that go to food compared to anti-bacterial soap washing. Compared to alcoholic solution and handwashing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, alcohol scrubbing has been found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than bacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcoholic handwashing to reduce H1N1-type influenza and hard-to-hand spores. Measures to improve the cleanliness of hands in health-care settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing availability of alcohol washes, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand-washing with soap is recognized as an essential and affordable tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supplies, soap or hand-washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to find general hand-washing behaviours.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps are rarely found near each private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low hand-washing rates can be the result of ingrained habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating hand-washing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in middle-income low-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand-washing in schools is the “three-star approach” designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star until they eventually reach three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of hand-washing promotion campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of consciousness-raising campaigns that try to bring about behavioural change. Because of the 2019-20 Corona virus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an expression symbol for handwashing.
A few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand-washing in developing countries and its relationship to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one audit indicates that promoting hand-washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of hand-washing for human health - especially for people in critical circumstances such as mothers who have just been born or wounded in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century as one of two clean hands: the Hungarian physician Agnes Similves, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and English Florence Nightingale, “Recent Nursing Founder”.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was caused by the odours of the so-called Myazmaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-care infections prompted the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more effective hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of pig flu in 2009 and the Coved-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of hand-washing with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing “right hand-washing methods” were suspended next to hand-washing basins in public toilets and in office and airport building latrines in Germany.
The term “washing hands from” means a declaration that one does not want to take responsibility for the thing or participate in complicity in it.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in Matthew, where Pilate washed his hands from the decision of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but became a much broader term in some English societies.
In Macbeth Shakespeare's play, Ms. Macbeth began to wash her hands too often in an attempt to cleanse a place of fiction that represented her guilt for the crimes she had committed and the crimes she had urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about immoral acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate handwashers more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “clean-up” compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
The symbolic hand-washing, using water without hand-washing soap, is part of the hand-washing ritual that has emerged in many religions, including the Baha’i, Hindu, and Tivelah faith, the Jewish handwashing, the Christian shower, and the Muslim spotlight. Religions also impose the health-washing of hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require the washing of hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose hand-washing before and after each meal.
Koffid-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
In the workplace, the risk control controls of Kovind-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control controls for the prevention of the 2019 Corona virus (Coved-19).
Proper controls of risk control in the workplace depend on the workplace and the job function, based on an assessment of the risk of exposure sources, the risk of disease in society, and the risk factors that threaten working individuals who may be exposed to Coved-19.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OHSHA), low-risk work involves a minimum level of communication with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which it is recommended that basic measures be applied to prevent infection, including hand washing and to encourage workers to stay home if they are ill, to observe cough and sneezing ethics, and to maintain normal practices for cleaning and cleaning the working environment.
Jobs with medium exposure risks include those requiring frequent or close contact with unknown or suspected individuals with code 19, but may be infected by continuous transmission in the community or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the public as in schools, high labour-intensive work environments, and some large retail places.
Risk control controls for this group, in addition to the basic procedures for the prevention of infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in the event of dealing with a person with code 19.
The Department of Occupational Safety and Health considers health-care workers and the mortuary who are exposed to a person known to be exposed to or suspected of being exposed to high levels of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to extremes if the workers carry out aerobic procedures, or collect or deal with samples from a known or suspected person who has been exposed to an aerobic aerobic aerobic aerobics.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as passive pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
Coved-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Patterns of trade may change, both in terms of the quality of the goods required, and the ways in which they are obtained (e.g., shopping at non-peak hours or through delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by code 19 may cease. The preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive action.
The plans address risk levels associated with different workplaces and functions, including exposure sources, risk factors from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Also define controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for positions that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing staff transmission, protecting those most at risk of negative health complications, maintaining business processes and reducing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business takes place affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Due to the fact that the risks of Koed-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include separating staff from labour risks without relying on workers ' behaviour, and can be the most cost-effective solution for implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protection equipment (PBE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment must be selected based on the worker ' s risk, appropriate suitability as appropriate (e.g. respirators), continuous and proper wear, regular inspection, maintenance and replacement, as necessary, removal, cleaning and storage, or proper disposal to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (OHSHA), jobs involving lower exposure to risk involve a minimum level of communication with the public and other co-workers.
Basic measures to prevent recommended infections for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand-washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, taking into account coughing and sneezing ethics, including mouth and nose coverage at coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or organizing work shifts in a sequential manner if necessary, discouraging workers from using tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and cleaning of the working environment.
The immediate identification of individuals likely to be infected and isolated is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with acute respiratory diseases should remain at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms are removed for at least 24 hours without using fever-preventive or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies should be flexible, that staff members should be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that staff should be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Department, jobs with an average risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact within a distance of six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected individuals who may be infected with code 19, but may be infected with SARS-K-2 due to continuous transmission in the community around the workplace, or because the person recently made international travel to a location where the transmission is widespread.
Engineering controls include the installation of high-quality air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezes, the installation of windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. Management controls and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing successively organized work shifts, cutting off unnecessary travel to sites where there is a constant outbreak of 19, developing emergency communication plans including a forum to respond to workers ' concerns, providing workers with updated education and training on risk factors and preventive behaviour related to the 19th delegations, training workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment on how to use them, providing resources and work environments that encourage personal hygiene, requiring regular hand-washing, limiting the access of clients and the public to the work site, disseminating signs of hand-washing and other protective measures related to the 19th delegations, training workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment on how to use them, workers who are exposed to the risk of being exposed to personal hygiene, or who are exposed to the risk of wearing of less personal protective devices, or who are in need to wear protective devices, including a combination of less protective devices, or protective devices.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on an aircraft, appropriate protective controls for the protection of employees and other passengers include the removal of the sick passenger from others by 6 feet, the assignment of one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, the provision of a face mask to the sick person or the requirement of the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs at the time of coughing or sneezing.
The crew of the aircraft must wear medical gloves that can be disposed of when dealing with a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger suffers from fever, constant cough or difficulty breathing.
For commercial freight, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control controls include the postponement of sick travel, self-segregation and immediate notification to the medical centre on board if a person is infected with fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure of cleaning or cleaning if the infected person is in the school building regardless of the prevalence in society.
When there is a limit to transmission in society ranging from limited to medium, social separation strategies can be implemented, such as the elimination of field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education lessons, band lessons or eating meals in the canteen, increased distances between offices, the organization of consecutive attendance and departure times, the reduction of unnecessary visitors, and the use of a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social-diversity strategies, the extension of school departures can be taken into account. For law enforcement officials who carry out routine daily activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of having been infected with 19. They are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and clean up work belts and tools before reuse using a spray or household cleaning mop, and follow standard operating procedures to deal with pollution and dispose of personal protective equipment used and to collect and wash clothes.
According to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health, some health-care workers and the mortuary are in categories with high or very high levels of risk exposure.
Jobs with a high level of risk exposure include health care service providers, support, laboratories and medical transport for known or suspected patients with code 19.
These become very high risk exposures if workers perform aerobic procedures, as well as collect or deal with samples from confirmed or suspected patients with code 19.
Aerobic generation procedures include intubation, coughing procedures, reeds, certain dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invasive samples.
The functions of a high-risk mortuary include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of confirmed or suspected persons with code 19 at the time of death; those with a very high risk exposure level if they perform an autopsy; additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients with code 19, including in the implementation of aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized passive pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples should be handled using Level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of having been infected with code 19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-KAF-2 and those conducting aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, a N95-type candidate, or better equipment, must be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory protection programme, which includes installation and suitability testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide greater protection and improve workers’ comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, because Coved-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for testing staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples from, take care of, or transport without any procedures for the generation of aerosols, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, goggles, face protection, squadrons and gloves.
If an aerosol procedure is implemented, the face mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protection equipment is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those directly caring to enter a room with a patient with code 19, using only the personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the same respiratory mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and discouraging the use of masks for individuals without symptoms.

Subject line: [Coughed 19] Relieving the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of transmission: March 14, 2020, Global Standard Time
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
We have found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
Covide's epidemic has become 19 things that clearly demonstrate the global human interdependence and the responsibilities we have towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on the kind of global compassion, cooperation and community-building that are at the heart of this institution.
The great friendship and care that we have witnessed among all our colleagues through e-mails, calls and conversations is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human feelings surrounding, fortunately, the way we work.
I am very grateful and deeply proud that you are true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to move towards Wikipedia right now, and of the powerful symbolism shown by the fact that this critical resource remains available online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it be through the continued operation of sites, our colleagues getting paid, or the safety of our communities.
The world is in dire need of the information available in Wikipedia more than ever before.
It's a moment when the positive impact in the world is not only on our efforts, but also on the way it is done.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make major adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to the modus operandi and timetables
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team J met yesterday to discuss our way and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that debate, we considered what we thought could be an appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to maintain the sustainability of the work of the institution during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that's fine.
All employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not about to announce a vacation, and if you're able to work longer than your normal working hours, you might add your efforts to the mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get goods from groceries or go to a doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your times.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should be understood to allow this without expressing it, but we certainly remind him.
No sick leave or paid leave is required. You can only report to your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If the doctor diagnosed you with Cowed-19 with a positive diagnosis, please inform Brian at the Department of Training and Certification so that the Department of Training and Certificates can help by providing support and ensuring that your condition is properly taken care of by the Department.
Hourly fellows receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned that, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and fellow hourly workers.
Each employee will be paid on the basis of normal working hours during normal conditions.
This includes whether the employee is ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people are using action to overcome the pressures that are spreading around the world.
What we can do will be amazingly productive, especially during difficult times like this.
Once again, it's about caring for oneself.
We only ask you to contact your manager so that he can know what to expect and adjust the procedures accordingly.
Some actions are necessary.
There are also some things that we must keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, human resources operations, trust, trust and fund-raising (and others) are doing very important work, which may require further support.
We will begin a process in cooperation with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to support the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There's a lot of work we all need to do, and we'll just focus on the most important projects.
Go slower now. It won't hurt us later.
We're not planning on "double the time to work to make it right" after the pandemic is over.
We're not expected to work extra hours to meet today's unrealistic deadlines.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables as soon as it becomes appropriate.
What happens in annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our annual planning for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time to design the budget to allow staff to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones while reconciling those who need or want to work within a reduced schedule of working hours within the next few weeks.
This extension of the timetable eases the current planning workload and pressure across the entire institution.
We will present our proposal to the Governing Council next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is obtained.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office status, exposure and clean-up
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been infected with the Coffide-19 virus.
However, starting with extreme caution and ban, we hired a viral clean-up team to clean up all the surfaces in San Francisco's office.
The team has used the level of virus resistance solution used in hospitals to clear all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building implemented its own duty of care protocol using products that support the safety of tenants.
We're relieved that the office is properly prepared until we decide to get back to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C., is located in a building belonging to WWWW, which has shared its Coffee 19 protocol with all the members of our Washington D.C. team.
Starting last week, our office in Washington, D.C., moved to a completely remote location under joint guidance with our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-term teleworking colleagues know it may be an adjustment, and they wanted to give you some advice:
Meetings should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consideration should be given to how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda should be prepared, and the reading materials should be sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, and tools such as Google Docs and ZOM should be used to facilitate cooperation and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, with one person monitoring the conversation to learn questions and track the list of speakers, and another to help take notes (or implement the collaborative process of taking notes).
An e-mail should be sent to technical support when comfortable headphones are required.
The health and safety compensation programme can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.
You can join #remoties Channel in the Slack application to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The Human Resources Operations Team is looking for guidance for user-friendly online meeting-based elements to support the increase in business distributed across our institution.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of web editors, to declare the pandemic over.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these targets.
Next week, we will issue additional follow-up guidance on Buickemidia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general feelings of the world community are mixed between the sadness of the turmoil, the satisfaction of clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikipedia and others.
In view of the progress made in these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Metawicki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all contacts with it.
Keeping abreast of topics related to Kuved-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific time for the meeting of the Working Group.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer questions and spend time communicating.
We're going through this together and we're always willing to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this e-mail, and all other necessary information concerning the 19-Coffid available in Oves Wikie.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up to date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers residing in highly affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need to help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with the Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send an e-mail to Brian Gooden, Director of Global International Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes shall be construed as a renunciation of our work or of our obligations.
Instead, it is a realization at this moment that our work and our commitments are likely to need to adapt in a way that we have never experienced in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our workers with the support they need, and provide the world with the service on which they depend.
The work we have planned to achieve will be waiting for us when it comes to its completion.
Now, it is time for everyone to help each other and to create space for the important work that comes in the coming weeks and months.
We need you all to make this happen, so we need you all to take care of yourselves and your families to be at your best when the time comes for your efforts.
Please now wash your hands and don't touch the face!
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K., Amy V, Brian J., Dorin D., Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel El, Lynette El, Ryan Em and Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant Aye, Heather W., Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin Ae, Ryan M and Toby N).
The angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart and kidney, as well as intestines.
The Angiotensin-converted enzyme 2 is opposed to the act of analytic-transformed enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of engiotuncin-2 and increasing engiotuncin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entry for some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Enzymic converter for ngyotensine 2 is defined as a vinyl enzyme containing zinc element and is located on the surface of the blanket cells and other cells.
The enzyme protein converting to engyotensine 2 on the Piptides M2 scale has an amino limb, and the colictrin carbonoxyli chain contains a renal amino acid transporter.
An engyotensin 2 is a single-passing membrane protein type 1, with active enzyme receivers found on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The outside part of the cell is separated from the cell's cell range for an engyotensin 2 from the band via the membrane by an enzyme called Shedaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then exits through the urine.
Enzymonesis 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 skeletal cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, and in the blanket cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The reposi DNA of the rebuttal enzyme transformer of engiotensine 2 is found in the cerebral cortex, the blueprint, an area below the digestor, and the brain stem.
The basic function of an enzyme converting to ngyotensine 2 is to act as a balancer of an enzyme converting to ngyotensine.
Enzymic converting angiotencin stimulates the transformation of angiotencin 1 hormone into angiotencin 2 holding blood vessels.
In contrast, the angiotensin-transformed enzyme 2 separates the amino acid-containing carboxyl vinyl lanin from the angiotensine 2 (aspartite-argen-valen-tairosine-isulosene-hestedine-prolene-vinyl-lanin) and analyses it into angiotensin (1-7), (hestedine-aspartite-argen-valen-tairosine-isulosene-histin-prolene-vinyl-lanin).
The angiotensin 2-converted enzyme separates into a number of other peptides, including [dis-Argenine9]-Pradrikin, Ablin, Neurotenecin, Dynorvina and Gerlin.
The Angiutane 2 transformer enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral vector for SLC6A19, and also has a role in Hartenpe disease.
As a protein via my membrane, the regenerative enzyme is the main entry point to the cells for some coronary viruses, including NL63, SARS Cove (the virus causing SARS), and SARS Cove-2 (the virus causing Koped-19 disease).
In particular, the association of the S1 Spike protein with the SARS Cove and SARS Cove-2 virus with the enzyme range of the angiotensine 2 enzyme on the surface of the cells leads to cellular insulation and the transmission of the virus and the enzyme to the internal particles that are located in the cells.
This input process needs to be configured with a protein protein enzyme through the membrane, the host's serin2, whose inhibitor is still being tested as a possible cure. This makes some assume that reducing the levels of the enzyme converted to neutanesine 2 in the cells may help to resist infection.
In any event, many specialized associations and self-organizing bodies recommend the continued use of reagents of reagent enzymes for the usual engiotunicine, and the blockages of the Angiotensin receivers as a cure.
A systematic and retreading study published on July 11, 2012 showed that “the use of retorted enzyme inhibitors for nitrogen was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference set.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia has decreased among patients treated with retina-convertive enzyme inhibitors, who were at greater risk of pneumonia, especially those suffering from stroke or heart failure.
The use of recombinant enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in deaths due to pneumonia, although the results have been less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
It is believed that the recombinant regenerative enzyme 2 (RhACE2) will be a new treatment for acute lung injuries. It has been found to improve the distribution of pulmonary blood, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by multiple fatty sugars.
The half-life of an enzyme converted to a damaged Angiotine 2 is approximately 10 hours, while it starts in 30 minutes, in addition to its continued effectiveness (time period) until 24 hours.
There are many indications that the recombinant enzyme of NG2 may be a promising cure for those suffering from the unsustainability of the traditional resonance system (RAS) inhibitors, and the diseases associated with a rise in engiotensin 2 in the blood. Clinical experiments are under evaluation, about the effect of the transgenic enzyme injection of NGOTINS 2 on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Covide-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices specifically designed to help track people involved in the response to the 2019-20 virus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“mixers”) who may have engaged someone infected.
Several applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed to design applications to track mixtures.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of users.
Less intrusive alternatives to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they might integrate a function supporting these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and IOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alibay, published an application that allows citizens to verify whether or not they have involved people with code 19.
It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an application called TraceTogether.
The application has been designed by a local information technology association and issued as an open-source application and is due to be handed over to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona” application, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to health-care authorities.
The application has been designed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology in cooperation with the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was still awaiting accreditation to Google Play and App Store of Apple.
On April 12, the Government stated that the Mixture Tracking Application was in the advanced stage of development and might be available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar application, “StopCovid”.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering designing applications based on the TraceTogether application launched by Singapore, as well as the Blue Tres Protocol. Russia intends to introduce an application that uses the geo-survey environment for patients diagnosed by doctors with the 19-almost-residents of Moscow, and is designed to ensure that they do not leave the home.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positive cases and a possible lack of effectiveness if applications were used only for a small segment of the population.
To deal with concerns about the proliferation of misleading or harmful applications of the Corona virus, Apple imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that could add their own applications related to the Corona virus to their own application shop; this was limited to “official” or other organizations of good repute only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacyists have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of the Corona virus, particularly as regards whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the Corona virus pandemic will disappear as soon as the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Control should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Extensions of monitoring and control should include provisions for determining the time of their suspension;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of code 19;
The security of data and the confidentiality of the identity of their owners should be protected and proven on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with external parties to the law should be specified;
Protections against abuse and protection of citizens ' rights should be in place to address abuses;
“Effective participation” needs to be provided by all “stakeholders involved,” including public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporter on Greenzen (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to deal with the ongoing control problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the hardware operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based tracking rather than applications, eliminating both the need to download the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
Network-based solutions with access to primary site data, however, have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; a number of privacy systems using only central servers have been established (see the following section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to implement hybrid tracking.
Instead of using an ad hoc application, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and includes such data to send notices via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential mixtures, the government has also made site information publicly available, which has been allowed by extensive changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus Corona in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. States, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy systems.
On April 6, 2020, the details of this matter have yet to be released.
On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to arrive at solutions compatible with privacy, such as low-energy Bluetooth (PLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BBC-PT was a coordinating effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include the tracking of decentralized approaches to privacy (DBB/DP3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CNN), privacy-sensitive protocols, mobile device tracking mechanisms (BCT), etc.
In these protocols, personal identification data do not leave the device, and all reconciliations occur on the device.
The MIT Media Lab privacy group was working on the development of SafePaths, a platform to use privacy techniques to collect and use site data or cross-tracks to track the spread of Kofeed-19.
Based on the research from the March 2020 “The Evil Face of Applications: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Pandemic Context,” the SaveTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that also originated in MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device techniques to allow users to share sensitive site and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, a Global Contact Point Tracking Coalition was established by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and highly overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability between tracking and alert applications, a key feature of widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Blue Tris Protocol, which is used by the official government application, open-source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the mobile systems of Android and IOS, announced an initiative to track mixtures; they claimed that they would maintain privacy by combining low-energy Bluetooth technology with privacy encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to project the system in three stages:
Tools developed to enable governments to establish official privacy applications to track the Corona virus
The integration of this function directly into the Android and IOS system as Google and Apple plan to solve ongoing use and control problems by distributing systems first through operating system upgrades and then by removing them in the same way as the threat ends.
The recycling of the drug (also known as reuse, reallocation, change of purpose or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is the redefinition of the use of a certified drug for treatment of a different disease or medical condition than originally designed for treatment.
This is a method of scientific research currently being used by researchers to develop safe and effective remedies for the 19th.
Other research trends include the development of the Coved-19 vaccine and the transfer of pure plasma. The SARS Cove-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treated proteins, each containing multiple-linked positions of the earrings.
Analysis of these sites provides the association with a reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates Cowed-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins for SARC-2 are two-door proteazes, reposic DNA-based polymyraz, helicas, proteins S and repophosphatase for diphosphosphonate.
Hüseyin A.A. and others studied several candidate compounds that were subsequently improved and analysed for the similarity of their structure to the most comparable approved drugs, with a view to accelerating the development of a strong anti-Sars Cove-2 drug in their pre-clinical study for recommendation in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is the antimalarial drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, a World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chloroquine and its associated hydrochloroquine could be among the four drugs studied as part of the clinical solidarity experiment.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Como, has announced that the experiments of the State of New York on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of hydroxychloroocene sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an emergency use permit (EUA).
The clinical trial treatment was not approved by the Department of Food and Medicine and was licensed under an emergency employment permit only as a trial treatment for emergency treatment of patients who have entered the hospital but cannot receive treatment in clinical trial.
CDC declared that it had not yet been determined “the use of hydrochloroquine to prevent or treat SARS Cove-2 virus infection, doses or period”.
Doctors said they use the drug when "no other choice".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York Langon Medical School is experimenting with the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydrochloroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Schengen claimed that Vavibiravir was “clearly active”.
Of 35 patients in Schengen, the test results were negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients suffering from pneumonia, half of them were given faveperavir and the other half received Omevenover.
The Italian Medicines Agency has alerted people to the fact that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and the army would use it to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat the patients of Coved-19.
According to the morning Southern China newspaper, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may have less impact on the treatment of the most acute cases where the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to get pregnant.
One study that used Lubinavir/Ritunavir (Kalitra), a combination of antivirals of Lubinavir and Ritunavir, stated that the results “did not detect any benefit”.
Drugs were designed to discourage HIV in order to prevent it from being copied by linking it to protein.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to access a compound associated with the Sars Cove-2 protein. The scientific community is witnessing criticism about channelling resources to redefining drug purposes specifically designed for HIV/AIDS treatment.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lubinavir/Ritunavir to the international solidarity experiment.
Geelad Sciences developed Rimdicifer’s drug as a cure for Ebola and Marburg virus infection. Geilade Sciences later discovered that Remedicifer was an antiviral activity in the laboratory against many virulent viruses, mucous viruses, and Corona viruses.
One of the problems related to antiretroviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-clinical studies suggest that Rimdicifer may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are many current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one is about patients with moderate disease, and the other is intended for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical experiments around vitamin C antiretroviral therapy on patients who have been hospitalized and suffer from severe disease due to Koed-19, as well as two experiments controlled by the use of fictitious medication (China, Canada) and an uncontrollable experiment (Italy).
The state of New York started experiments on the impact of antibiotic Azethromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to carry out a clinical trial on the use of Telejin, an inhaler for asthma treatment for patients with the new Corona virus prior to symptoms.
A phase II experiment is currently being conducted using a form of an engluentin converter enzyme 2 over 200 patients who are required to join the experiment from acute cases that have entered the hospital in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the efficacy of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute of Canada are currently studying the role of Kolchisen in reducing pneumonia and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of Coved-19.
The study, known as Kolkoruna, includes 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed by doctors with a code 19 and suffered from mild symptoms without having to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women, breastfed women or women who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not considered eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also tested in Italy.
Hyparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Drug Agency to publish instructions on its use.
A multi-centre study was announced in Italy for 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium ionoxabarin with doses of disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS Cove-2 is a virus, great scientific attention has been given to the re-use of antiretroviral drugs designed to deal with past outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Repaverine: Specialists recommended the use of Repaverine to treat Coffide-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of the Chinese Directive.
Omfinover: Specialists recommended using Omevenover to treat Coffide-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of the Chinese Directives
Some antibiotics identified by specialists include the possibility of reusability as a cure for code 19:
Tusilizomap (receiver of Interlocene 6): certified by China.
Experiences in Italy and China, too. See Tusilizamap #covid19.
Coved-19 is a supposed vaccine against the 2019 Corona virus (Coved-19) disease.
Although no vaccines for clinical trials have been completed, many attempts are under way to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect to have a vaccine against SARS-KOV-2, the virus that caused it, in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
Coved-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against Sars-Koff-2.
The requirements of the Alliance for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, wide dissemination and global access.
In April, scientists of the Epidemiological Preparedness Coalition reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against Koved-19.
The main objectives of the platform presented for the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (DNA and DNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Vector (phase I developer, candidate vaccine: Moderna, type 5 vector)
According to scientists of the Epidemiology Coalition in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Melkin Institute) and 37 more have been announced, but with little public information available (presumably in the planning or design phase).
Phase I and phase II experiments perform a first safety and immune test, usually random, controlled anonymously, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III experiments typically involve more participants, including the reference group, and a vaccine effectiveness test for disease prevention, with control of the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed from early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under “pre-clinical”).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On approximately January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that work on a vaccine would begin, aiming to start testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On approximately January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanniki Schwetmaker, announced that they had begun work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSults announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for vaccine development.
On February 8, 2020, the Oncogen Laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used to treat cancer with an antigen vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the Research Institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and that they had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, Nugenerex Immono-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had launched a vaccine project to create the Ii-Key Piptide vaccine against Coffid-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materials Command in Fort Derek and Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On approximately March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutes announced that she had formed a team with Novax Inc.
In the development of a vaccine and its manufacture.
Partners also announced plans for pre-clinical tests and a first-stage clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerated it would take at least a year and a half to nearly two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was a significant development similar to the Corona virus with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with human testing plans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CoreVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Coffide-19 vaccine, which the German government needed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company Biotech to participate in the development of a vaccine based on the sent DNA.
The DNA-based vaccine sent by the candidate BNT162, is currently undergoing pre-clinical tests with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would get the results of pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and the vaccine could start the final candidate with tests in humans by autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$ 4.9 million in a Coved-19 vaccine research consortium, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which pushed the total investment of the Epidemiological Innovations Alliance in the development of the Coved-19 vaccine to US$ 29 million.
The partners of the Coalition for Epidemiological Innovations for the Development of the Coffide-19 Vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a DNA vaccine that was self-enriched for Coved 19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against code 19, including several candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government has announced $192 million specifically for the development of the Coffide-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national vaccine bank from several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another outbreak of the Corona virus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PettCoVac, possible vaccine for Coved-19 in rats, stating that “s1 sub-unit vaccines for SARS-KAF-2 microscopic needles have given rise to strong responses to specific antibodies [in rats] that were clear from 2 weeks after vaccination.”
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo College of Pharmacy announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a possible nasal spray.
Using steroids, DNA will be designed for cloning within human bacteria to produce non-harmable viruses similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for SARS-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities assembled resources to access the giant IBM computers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called unspecified effects.
That means she can have benefits beyond the disease she's fighting.
Another random experiment in Australia seeks to register 4.170 health care workers.
Vaccines under development are likely not to be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine effectiveness using specific animal models for Coved-19, such as genetically modified mice with engiotensine-transformed enzymes 2, other laboratory animals and non-human heads, suggests the need for level-3 biosafety containment measures to deal with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Anti-Sars and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines were tested on non-human animal models.
From 2020, there is no cure or preventive vaccine for SARS that has proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for SARS treatment was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome.
When March spreads, it was thought that existing research around SARS might provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against the Mars-Koff infection.
As of March 2020, there was one vaccine for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (based on DNA) that had completed the first stage of clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines under development, all of which were HIV-oriented vaccines, two vaccines for gland virus (ChAdox1-MERS, BVRS-GamVAC) and one vaccine for MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have given rise to the conspiracy theory that the virus causing code 19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in many social media publications refer to existing patents for gene sequences and vaccines for other strains of Corona viruses such as the Corona virus causing SARS.
Corona 2019 (Coved-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Corona II virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove 2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory distress.
Other symptoms may include exhaustion, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat infection, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during mixing, mostly through spatter, sneezing, or talking.
When spray is dispersed in the process of exhale, it usually falls on the ground or on the surfaces instead of being contagious over long distances.
People may also get hurt when they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on the surfaces for 72 hours.
The standard method of diagnosis is the sequenced reaction of the RRT-PCR via a nasal float.
It is recommended that masks be used for those suspected of HIV infection and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending that they should not be used, some considering otherwise and others that should be used.
At present, there is no specific vaccine or antiretroviral treatment for code 19.
Local-level transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People living with HIV may not show symptoms or flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, exhaustion and respiratory distress.
Immediate medical care is advised if emergency symptoms of respiratory difficulty, pain or constant pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or blue face or lips appear.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nostalgia or sore throat may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China suffered from chest cramps and strokes only.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
It's called foster care.
The custody period for Koved-19 is usually five to six days, but it may range from two to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of those with symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that symptoms may not appear on all patients.
The role of carriers without symptoms in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may have contributed to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no known symptoms is currently under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) report that 20% of all confirmed cases did not show symptoms while in hospital.
China’s National Health Commission began to include cases with no symptoms in the daily outcome on 1 April; out of 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) of these cases did not show symptoms on the test.
Pygmies and saliva can carry large proportions of the virus.
Talking out loud results in more spray than talking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without oral coverage could lead to spraying up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted through bioaerobic aerosols, and the examination of samples of air collectors in the lobby outside the individual rooms has produced positive results for viral reposi DNA.
Some medical procedures, such as CBR intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory discharges to be released as spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread by feces, it is believed that the risk is limited. The virus is more contagious when people suffer from symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECCDC) says that although there is some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can go from two to three in general.
Specifically, the virus was found to be present for up to one day on cardboard and up to three days on plastics (polyproplin) and stainless steel (ESA 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective on condition that they are properly used; soap melts the virus's lipid membrane and shuts it down, in addition to removing the skin and other surfaces from it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexadine gluconone (surgical disinfectant), are available. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of saliva were taken after an average of two days of transport to hospital.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
The Corona II virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS Cove-2) is an emerging Corona virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, where three people suffering from pneumonia were first isolated in the group of acute respiratory infections in Wuhan.
The new SARS Cove-2 virus shares its properties with the relevant Corona viruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap destroys the virus, destroying its protective membrane. Sarse Cove-2 is closely associated with the original Cave.
Lungs are the organs most affected by Coved-19 because the virus enters host cells with an engyotensine-transformed enzyme (ACE2) which is the most abundant in type II sarcophagus present in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface sugar protein called Spike to contact ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of the injured people who entered the hospital in Wuhan, China, suffered from severe heart attacks, and more frequent in critical situations.
Symptoms rates are high due to systemic inflammation response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 in the heart.
ACE2's futures play a very important role in the heart and participate in its functioning.
The rate of clots (31%) and intravenous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with cavid-19 may be associated with poor prediction of the condition. An autopsy of the bodies of individuals who died due to Coffid-19 found widespread damage to an acupuncture (D.E.D.), and an inflammation of lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-KOV-2 has been moving towards the respiratory aortic cells expressed as ACE2, severe Koped-19 patients suffer from symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T cells that screen GMSF pathogens have been found to be associated with the introduction of the only cells that screen Interlocine 6 pathogens for inflammation and endemic lung diseases in Coffid-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a amphibian leachate at the time of the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
RRT-BCR is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually conducted using respiratory samples taken from a nasal utensils survey; however, a nasal palsy or a sample can also be used with a brain.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it requires two blood samples by two weeks and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the Corona virus and spread the gene sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop PCR tests for HIV infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which may detect active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed that accuracy only ranges from 60% to 70%.
The US Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical-care-point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidance from the Chongenan Hospital at Wuhan University suggested ways to detect infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Multi-sectioned binary glass floats with an oceanic, asymmetric and backward spread are common features at the beginning of the injury.
There may be an underside spread and a stone-sharp shape (segregation thickness with uneven senile fillings) and an integration with the evolution of the disease.
There are few data available on the pathological microbes and physiology of Coved-19.
Main pathological findings from the autopsy:
Microscopic examination: pneumocococcal, pertussis, pneumococcal inflammation
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of the pulmonary cells, large, non-model hemorrhagic cells, inflammation during me with amphibian leachate and the formation of multiple nuclei giant cells
Acute pneumonia: widespread d.A.D. fibrosis with widespread dysentery.
The widespread senile damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxia.
Pneumonia treatment: organization of abrasions in the senile cavities and cell pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: D.I.C. clotting; white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, exercising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering mouth and nose with a handkerchief at coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inner part of the facility if no handkerchief is available.
It's recommended that the hands be cleaned well after any cough or sneeze.
CDC recommended the use of tarp caps in public places, partly aimed at reducing the transmission of non-stereopathological infections. Social divergence strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Divergence instructions also require people to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart from each other.
There is no medicine known to be effective in preventing Coved-19. Given that no vaccine was expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of the control of Kofeed-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the “spilling of the curve.”
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, cough, or sneeze.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-containing hand sterilizer at least 60% when soap and water are not available. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these two formulations arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial apogee in alcohol; it is “not an effective substance to cleanse hands”.
Add glycerol as moisturized.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organ support affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of HIV infection wear a simple face mask.
Exterior membrane oxygen (ECMO) is used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under study.
It is recommended that personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet be used to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those suffering from mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of those who were hospitalized because of Coved-19.
In the United States, intensive care specialists and lung pathologists collected treatment recommendations from a variety of bodies in a free resource, the critical case care book available online.
As of April 2020, there was no specific cure for code 19.
For symptoms, some specialist doctors recommend the use of paracetamol (astyminophene) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of HIV transmission, especially in health-care settings when implementing actions that may result in spraying, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For health-care professionals who care for those affected by Coved-19, CDC recommends placing the person in the air-borne infection isolation room (AIR) in addition to standard precautions, blending precautions and air-borne disease precautions. CDC explains the guidance for the use of PPE during the pandemic.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment bazaars, respirators or face masks, eye protections, medical gloves; respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred as they become available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial plants, but the Food and Drug Department authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Permit (EEU).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using facial protections, or homemade masks as the last solution.
Most of the cases of Kovid-19 are not so degraded as to require artificial breathing or alternatives, but some cases need to be.
The type of respiratory support provided to people suffering from respiratory failure associated with code 19 for those in hospitals is being actively studied, with some evidence of the avoidability of intubation using high-flow nasal vial or positive double pressure of the airway.
It is not known whether either of these options is of the same benefit to those in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gaseous artificial respiration when it is available because this technology limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal canals. There are many critical situations among older persons (over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds in relation to the population, which limits the ability of the health system to cope with the sudden rise in the number of high-risk Koed-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to ICUs, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of those who have been hospitalized because of Koed-19 eventually enter intensive care units.
Industrial respiration becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) for people with code 19 and the supply of oxygen becomes more difficult.
Respiratory devices need to have high end-of-life pressure control conditions to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing lung risk associated with respiratory and thoracic wind.
High positive end-of-life hyperphylaxis may not be available in old respirators.
The search for possible treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Seems like the most proselytizing Remedisifer.
Although new medicines may take until 2021 to develop, many tested medicines have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on those in critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. The Food and Drug Department has granted a temporary licence to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
He did not undergo the necessary clinical studies to prove that he was safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile phone application to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter the name and identity number.
The application can detect `mixers' using surveillance data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-immolation, but also alerts local health officials. Large-scale data analyses of mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and those involved in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the Corona virus.
Action has been taken to impose quarantine and protect the potential mixers of infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data of the collected telephone sites with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Coch Institute, for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition to detect quarantine offenders.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Mr. Julio Gallera, stated that mobile phone companies told him that "40 percent of people still travel everywhere."
The German government hired Hakathon for 48 hours on weekends, in which more than 4,000 people participated.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Kaliolaid, also presented a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the Corona virus.
Individuals may be disturbed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
BBC published a saying to Rory O'Connor: "Increased social isolation, unity, health anxiety, tension and economic stagnation is a severe storm that affects people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a light cycle with minor symptoms or without symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the cold.
Simple cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to be severely infected with code 19 based on data for other similar viruses, such as SARS and Meres, but there is still a lack of data for code 19. Coved-19 may affect the lungs in some people by causing pneumonia.
Coved-19 may rapidly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, anatomy or multiple organ failure.
Symptoms associated with code 19 are infection, abnormal clotting of blood, heart, kidney and liver damage.
Six percent of those who were admitted to hospital were diagnosed with blood clotting abnormality, specifically an increase in prothrombine time, while four percent of them were observed having kidney dysfunction.
Nearly 20-30% of those with hepatic code 19 showed high levels of liver enzymes (safety vectors).
According to the same report, the average period between symptoms and death was 10 days, of which 5 were in the hospital.
However, the average period for those transferred to the ICU between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the overall level of cases was 6 to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men ' s mortality rate was 2.8%, while women ' s mortality rate was 1.7%.
Anatomy tests of postmortem lung samples show widespread hemorrhagic damage with cell-based fibromoxide discharges in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy have been observed in the sarcophagus.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage was observed due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest in 11.8% of deaths declared by China’s National Health Commission.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those who were hospitalized had previous illnesses. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the region may also affect deaths.
Estimates of mortality resulting from the situation vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also because of methodological difficulties.
A incomplete inventory of minor cases may lead to a higher estimate of mortality than the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases of death have occurred may suggest that the current mortality rate is lower than the reality.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to suffer from acute symptoms of code 19 and 2.4 times more likely to die than non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term complications of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital has revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients, and lung tests indicate damage.
It could also cause post-comfort syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not the previous infection would bring effective and long-term immunity to those recovering from the disease.
The acquisition of immunity is seen as a possibility, based on the behaviour of the other Corona viruses, but it was announced that there had been a recovery from Coved-19 and subsequently re-infected.
It is believed that these situations are exacerbated more if the infection continues than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of the infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was largely a result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of Coved-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 was the first date of symptoms.
Official WHO publications reported that December 8, 2019 was the first date of symptoms.
Many actions are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) allocated, as part of the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, U 07.1 for laboratoryly confirmed deaths of SARS Cove-2 infection and U 07.2 for diagnosed deaths of SAR Coved-2 clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation of HIV infection. The mortality rate for infections is expressed by the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate for injuries is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191), as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the CFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those detected and died of a disease, and the IFR mortality rate, which reflects the percentage of those infected (those detected and undetected) and those who died of a disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they also follow a specific population from injury to the fate of the situation.
Although antibodies may not be produced by all injured, their presence may provide information on the number of injured.
In Italy, Castilion de Ada, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Ganglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and it moved to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all of Koed-19’s deaths were officially classified as a result.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, maybe about 3% have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
The death of 69 (0.004% of the population) was confirmed by Koved-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting mortality rate vary between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher among men in studies in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is at 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women disappearing at 90 years of age only.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, the non-prevalence of smoking among women and the simultaneous morbidity of men, such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women, may have contributed to the high mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men and 72% died because of Coved-19 men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data on the Caved-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and their risk of HIV infection increases.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name of the disease to be Coved-19.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tidros Adhanom Gebresus, explained that Ko was short for the word Corona, and in short for the virus Wed, short for the disease, 19 referred to the year of first outbreak discovery: December 31, 2019.
The name was selected to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for labeling aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes Coffid-19 is called the Corona II virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS COFF-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses the terms “Coffid-19 virus” and “Coffid-19 virus” in public statements.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the Corona virus.
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the Corona virus and the Corona-Whan virus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the use of the new Corona virus 2019 and the acute respiratory disease associated with the new Corona virus 2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 Directive prohibiting the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names Coved-19 and Sars Cove-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Given the limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export health-care materials such as nose swabs and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventor valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local start-up company reversed its engineering and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of Coved-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged with regard to the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread over the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that the virus was proliferating in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines for the treatment of the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for Covide 19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Solidarity Experiment to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiretrovirals that are most promising.
There is no vaccine available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS Cove are used because it looks like SARS Cove-2 in the use of ACE2 receivers to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection in Coved-19.
The second strategy, the micro-unit vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS Cove 2, this research focuses on the SpikeS protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 enzyme receivers.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine innovation technique).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical vaccine trial began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-adverse genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-based pride was cited as a potential challenge to the development of SARS Cove-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials under way from April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved treatments for malaria were evaluated, including four studies relating to hydrochloric chlorine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed for re-use in the treatment of the new disease constitute most of the Chinese research, through nine third-phase experiments on Rimdzivir across several countries, the results of which are due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential Koped-19 vaccines and real estate has been carried out from April 2020. Many of the existing antiretroviral properties for Coffide-19 treatment are being evaluated, including rhymedicine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, Lubinavir/retunavir and Lubinavir/tonavir integrated with the Interferon Beta.
There is prima facie evidence of the effectiveness of Remedicyver, as of March 2020.
Bed improvement has been observed among patients treated with Rimdicifer for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquin, formerly used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review to be conducted.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research notes that although a dose of one gram is recommended, the dose is very low and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Department of Food and Medicine issued an emergency licence for chloroquine and chloroquine hydroxie at the discretion of treating physicians for those suffering from Coffide-19. The 7th version of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, reipavrene or omephinephere for the treatment of Coffide-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of Repaverine are necessary to discourage SARS Cove-2 in the laboratory.
It was recommended that further study be undertaken of the impact of Nitazoxanede on biota after demonstrating its inhibition of the low concentration of Sars Cove-2. Studies have shown that the initial development of the Spyke protein via trans-serene protein (TMPRS2) is necessary to enter Sars Cove-2 through interaction with the future of ACE2.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin contain major deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamifer Sars Cove-2 is not discouraged in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of Koed-19.
The cytokin storm may be one of the complications in the late stages of acute Koed-19.
There is evidence that chloroquine hydroxy may have anti-sytokin properties. The China National Health Committee added to the treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
At the national level in Italy, he is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test, which has shown positive results for those with severe illness.
In addition to being used to test vertein in the blood serum to determine sytokin storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some of the injured.
The Department of Food and Medicine has adopted anti-Interlocine-6, the treatment of the yemry antigen T-cells, based on the retrospective case studies for the treatment of sytokine fusion syndrome for non-responsible steroids, which had a different cause in 2017.
So far, there's no consistent evidence that Tusilizomp is an effective cure for cytokin release syndrome.
The method of transfer of refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the recovered immune devices from Coved-19 to those who need them is subject to study as a non-vaccinative method of passive insemination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
The neutralization of the virus is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibodies treatment can act as a defence broker against SARS Cove-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular toxicity based on antibodies or mulch or both, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibodies treatment, such as the use of manufactured single-chip antibodies, are under development.
The production of pneumocococcal serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies of this virus, can be increased for faster dissemination.
Corona virus diseases, a series of closely related syndromes
Lee Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently injured and died of Koved-19 after raising attention to the spread of the virus.
