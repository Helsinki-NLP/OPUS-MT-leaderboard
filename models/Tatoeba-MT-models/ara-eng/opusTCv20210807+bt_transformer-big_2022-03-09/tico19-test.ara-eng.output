Rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of COVID-19 shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, confirming that while the stage varies depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of an unknown pathogen was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as SARS-CoV-2.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that approximately 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild illness; that is, they have respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of these recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 worsened into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% suffered from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK (UK) and compare them with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has become increasingly geographically widespread and follows the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and this date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained from official sources only such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to those in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative number of sporadic COVID-19 cases over 14 days, and then took into account the normal course of COVID-19, across all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m., compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases harvested over a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the UK followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar growth trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary substance).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It is highlighted that as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and UK countries have reported the total number of cases already similar to that found in Italy just 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar speed in all nations.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of case definition differences in different countries and protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where almost 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or ICUs for COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they need to be systematically collected to complement existing surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a great diversity in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
Modeling scenarios associated with health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK for the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a 90% risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, are available in the 6th update of the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention’s Rapid Risk Assessment for COVID-19.
Because the cases collected so far are in certain areas of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and ICUs usually serve specific regional populations, information about the cases and ICU beds is best provided at the regional unit designation level of NUTS-2.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
States, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 sustainable community transition scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of health care, especially intensive care, such as in affected areas in Italy.
As outlined in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a proactive, comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while shifting from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited window of opportunity during which countries can increase their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
SARS-CoV-2, similar to the similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, can also travel from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmitted and influential among older people than younger people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications related to the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the basics of epidemiology, its etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors for the duration of the holiday and for many weeks after it due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named COVID-19.
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 involving its own virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the isolated virus through many patients.
This review aims to summarize research progress in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and prognosis as well as some pressing questions that remain.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, and have mainly caused about 15% of the 4 common colds.
However, in this century we have encountered two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with idiopathic pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the first death.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, suggesting that the disease could be passed from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed with all public transport shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was considered the location of infection initiation from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided a more up-to-date explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.jq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but mainly affects people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Nearly half of those infected (47.7%) were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
Covid-19 expanded between groups in and mainly around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of infection to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of injury from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproductive number (base reproductive number) was 3.77 (trust range is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted base reproductive number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (confidence range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (confidence range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (?60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a family of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome.
It can be divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and the coronaviruses of the genus alpha and beta are known to infect humans.
The encapsulated fork (S) of the glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors and is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the dipeptide peptidase 4 (DPB4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, the genomic RNA is accompanied by sugary envelope proteins and nucleated capsid proteins form vesicles containing virions, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was discovered to be a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Wuhan Seafood Market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
An electron microscopy of the transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in extremely thin sections of human airway phenomenology.
The human-converted enzyme AE2 has been shown to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2 less strongly than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and limit IFN expression; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Chu et al. reported on the structure of the full length of the ACE2 transducer human enzyme under the hypercooled electron microscope with a resolution of 2.9 degrees within a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had been assembled to form a dimer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could bind to two S proteins, providing a guide to identifying the coronavirus and infection.
A sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
Sars-Cove and Mers-Cove were known to have originated from bats and passed on to humans via civets and camels, respectively.
By comparing the strain development of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus being 96 percent identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross the interfactional barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission pathway has yet to be clarified.
G et al. proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that squamous anteaters – long-tongued ant-eater mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine – are the likely intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic similarity in the coronavirus discovered in squamous ant-eaters and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% variation spread across the genome is still significant; hence, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days in temperatures below 20 degrees Celsius and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75% concentration, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other adipose solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and is therefore more vulnerable to infection with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response has been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies involving other coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRS) including kine-like type C receptors, tulle-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-bonding-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response soon joins the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4- and CD8-T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4-T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies intended for the virus, and CD8-T cells kill the virus-infected cells directly.
Auxiliary T cells produce inflammation-activated cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by triggering programmed T-cell death.
Combination immunity, including complementary proteins such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary in the fight against viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies neutralized a recovered MERS-CoV patient.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older adults with multiple illnesses and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are damaged to have a greater chance of becoming infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or usually 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed an incubation period of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is extremely important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and then prevent people who are infected but have no symptoms from passing on the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo a 14-day quarantine.
Does the quarantine time have to be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary symptom of COVID-19 and can be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal ache, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thrombopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and high fever should be screened, even without imaging for pulmonary abnormalities, for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group that contracted the infection from a person who did not show symptoms.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also experienced fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed much more respiratory support than COVID-19 patients and matched MERS' higher death rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29-75%), shortness of breath (40-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were found to be the most important symptoms, and respiratory support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate from COVID-19 was 2% while the confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, by November 2002 the SARS death rate was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to Mears, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's base reproductive number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence range of 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV's base reproductive number ranged from only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their own symptoms, mortality rate, and base reproduction number is shown in table table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater diffusion potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more difficult than controlling the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of disease in clusters often occurs in the same family, from the same cluster, or from the same vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or having come into contact with people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovered patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alert to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphocytic insufficiency with white blood cell count was detected, including lymphocyte count > 1 > 109, and elevated levels of aspartate amine transporter and blood secretion in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes in the blood of some patients increased, the C-reactive protein increased, and the red glomerular gravity rate increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, which is caused by fibrin breakdown in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Imbalances in radiographs appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double-luminal shadows or yellowed glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
The dysfunction of the lung cells of type 1 and type 2 reduces the level of surface activator and increases surface tension, thereby, reducing the ability of the lungs to stretch and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography and the most severe extent of the disease are often compared.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pulmonary cell exfoliation, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphatic leaching, and multiple eukaryotic cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, in line with the pathology of viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations of the diagnosis (no longer individually dependent on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical appearances, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Chang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, detecting chunks of SARS-CoV-2's synthetic RNA at a rate of 20 x 10-18 moly/L to 200 x 10-18 moly/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dip in less than an hour without the need for microdevices.
We hope that the new technology can significantly improve sensitivity and relevancy if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors are able to provide mainly supportive care for COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have been used or previously proposed to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for use for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that export the ACE-2, such as the digestive tract, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure is the most serious threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory support is necessary to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, noninvasive respirators, and invasive artificial respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by Extracorporeal Membrane Oxidation (ECMOH), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFQQQ, IL-1Q, IL-2, IL-6, IFNQ, IFNQ, IFNQQ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the leading cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Activated hormones, tosylizumab, and an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include T-cell-directed immune reaction modulation; blockage of IFN-1, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of Janus kinase; plinatumumab; suppressor of cytokine 4 signaling; and histone decithylase inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at higher doses were not beneficial with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially angio-bone necrosis, which can severely affect the prognosis.
However, short cycles of anabolic hormones at small to medium doses have been recommended with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, the effectiveness of any antiviral treatment has not been confirmed.
However, it has been found that intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in a U.S. COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilead introduced the compound to China for some trials in individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, parisitinb, interferon-alpha, lupinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been proposed as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combined treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from a disease intended to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from developing the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (AG) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize and directly neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to roll out this method for widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, certain defects associated with plasma need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high for the treatment of critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or screening for effective antibodies against the virus's essential proteins, is more conclusive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a composition that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and check for optimal ingredients or combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Fengjie Do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules has been discovered to treat COVID-19.
The highest cure rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87 percent of their patients, including Ganzhou (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent), and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as many other factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases must be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his co-workers published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone to the combined treatment of Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They discovered that the durations needed to recover from high body temperature, symptomatic abstinence, and hospital stay were significantly shorter in the Western Medicine-TCM treatment group than in the Western Medicine-only treatment group.
More impressively, the exacerbation rate of symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine treatment group – TCM compared to the Western Medicine treatment group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine treatment group – TCM compared to the Western Medicine treatment group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-studied trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of procedures and clarify the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often feel intense fear of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people under quarantine feel bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, the symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to further anxiety and mental disorder.
In the initial phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric illnesses were reported including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
Tracking mandatory contact and quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatizing their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care must be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected victims, contacts and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with one another.
Effective vaccines to interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts are essential and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the efficacy of these candidate in vivo vaccines in older adults and lethal challenge models and their prevention of infection with a zoonotic virus were not determined before a clinical study began.
This is probably because SARS went away 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic MERS cases and clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is challenging because of the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as an emerging disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high prevalence and mortality in severe patients.
Building a model of disease outlook is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or correlate with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in determining SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
The age groups between 30 and 65 were mainly affected by COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were much older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 vs. 51), suggesting age as a predictive factor for COVID-19 patients' outcomes.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Associated Diseases and Complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiac accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive bile cells with angiotensin II-converting enzyme, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and latent disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictive factor for disease, treatment response, and final recovery.
The association between the level of C-reactive protein and the severity of COVID-19 and its prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate amine transporter (AST), alanine amine transporter (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Thoracic radiography and progressive progression of clinical symptoms must be considered together with other problems to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high-dose anabolic hormones were widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered angionecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, low-dose and short-term steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiologic features than SARS.
In addition to lower respiratory replication, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while most transmission of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Strenuous efforts are underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of impeding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have hurt the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowing epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the regression phase will last for 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have estimated that COVID-19, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longeni et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-range and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like periodic seizure.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases that are declining, suggesting that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can become weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually go away or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate by coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted by direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been found in the stool, raising a new possibility of passing from the stool to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Considerable precautions need to be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have come into contact with infected patients or people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small virions as much as 10 to 80 nanometers, with only 5% of virions being able to penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nanometers in size each.
Because particulate matter can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face protections or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is an appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, the director of the Wuhan CDC did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced the preparedness of the general public, especially when the entire state was preparing for the Spring Festival, and a critical time was lost to contain the disease at its lowest scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more cautious when issuing public statements because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more proactive and targeted training to raise public awareness of epidemics and test the response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months throughout China and about 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a sense of reoccurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals more than younger people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, sick people can become infected with the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With this rapid advance in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic similarity has been detected between SARS-CoV-2 and the two SARS-like coronaviruses in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we can't stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE-2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-releasing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, vanish like SARS, or return periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but may take some time to look for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, at whatever cost it may take, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as quickly as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have been driving co-evolution between coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two types of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have brought out the other side to reveal the extent to which infection with human coronaviruses can be severe and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 brought the coronavirus back into the spotlight, and surprised us with its rapid spread but with the ability to cause disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV is a zoonotic disease, so our understanding of the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they were non-pathogenic.
The intermediate repository hosts for some human coronaviruses have also been known.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Exploring the interactions between coronavirus and host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, it also highlights successful host switching requirements and the impact of complications of virus development on disease severity.
Coronaviruses (coronaviruses) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive RNA.
These viruses contain the largest genome among RNA viruses with 26 to 32 kilobases and have been called "coronary viruses" by that name because their structure resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain undivided genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large, overlapping open-reading molds (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted to the multiple copy proteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1-16.
The remainder of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Cascade (E), M membrane, and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on variation in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (Coronavirus Alpha, Coronavirus Beta, Coronavirus Gamma, and Coronavirus Delta), among which are the types of Coronavirus Beta that include most of the human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Genetic evolution evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic origin of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma and delta coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as serious human pathogens.
Seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known to date.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 belong to the alpha coronavirus.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a cold, diarrhea, or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in more patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARIS) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
Isolated from HCoV-229E, the first strain of B814, from nasal secretions of patients with a cold in the mid-1960s.
Much information has since been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, whose symptoms resolve spontaneously.
In fact, it was generally accepted that HCoV infection was harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest in modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people with an approximate death toll of about 10%.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has spread steadily in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019 novel human coronavirus), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 on March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are from bats, where viruses are well-adapted and non-pathogenic but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origins of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2's amplified reservoir, intermediate host, and host animal, with important effects to prevent future fallout.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, interspecies transmission, and the pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that the original HCoV viruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after being transmitted between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the HCoV pathway as its increased transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretions of patients with colds, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory infection in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with HCoV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, sore throat, fever, and cough in approximately 10-20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent transmission was in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which is asymptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally, and tend to be mostly transmissible during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a feeling of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, the infection of healthy individuals with HCoV-229E has caused mild colds.
Only a small number of immunocompromised patients showed severe injury to the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first human coronavirus pandemic to be well documented in human history and the causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be detected.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the supertransmission, it has been estimated that a single case of infection can lead to approximately two secondary conditions, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and peak viral load on the 10th day of illness.
Symptoms of SARS-CoV begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, and are followed by delayed symptoms of difficulty breathing, coughing, and respiratory distress.
Lack of lymphocytes, impaired liver function, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Also observed in SARS patients is diffuse alveolar injury, apparent cell proliferation, and an increase in the number of macrophages.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, in severe cases many organs can also be infected, including the digestive tract, liver, and kidneys, and are usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be especially deadly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on the human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by the human coronavirus-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the virus itself from a sample from the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as suffocation.
In the same year, HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbations of severe asthma attacks.
HCoV-HKU1 has been found to be globally prevalent and cause mild respiratory illness, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and in general the likelihood of them mutating to cause diseases with high prevalence rates is low, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses gain the ability to efficiently travel and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of close personal contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS sufferers have also experienced severe kidney failure, which is characteristic of MERS from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high fatality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients identified as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 has been declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO) as COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial death rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in China’s Hubei province is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some infected people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence by 82%, they belong to different branches of the Dynastic Evolution Tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more infectious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection are asymptomatic and may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has features that are more common in community-acquired HCoVs, including undefined or mild symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns specific to both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases after transmission to humans as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission from the oral anal route plays an important role, at least in some cases.
It is interesting whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
However, features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human translocation will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from the community and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have been survivors of ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses that infect humans with severe diseases have been eradicated as well as humans who have contracted severe human coronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be sufficiently cloned in humans to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that confront host-restricted agents.
From this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the greater the number of people infected with it, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it is difficult to stop human-to-human transmission through quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired coronaviruses have been circulating in human populations for many years, causing colds in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal repository.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans, and they were unable to continue human-to-human transmission.
They need to stay in and breed in their animal reservoirs and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
It's highly contagious, like community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear if it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplified hosts of HCoVs.
The animal serves as the evolutionary host for the human coronavirus if the virus harbors its closely related origin and shares a significant symmetry in the level of nucleotide sequences.
The parent virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host hosts the human coronavirus continuously and over a long period.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and the natural hosts are the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV enters the newly mediated host prior to or near its attack on humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes impairment.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and also acts as an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to extend the infection between humans.
HCoV infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to transmit from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and may even colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural repository host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a history of contact with gametes.
Serological prevalence surveys then indicated that animal dealers had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to normal people.
It was first determined that the masked palm yoghurt (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dog in live animal markets carried SARS-CoV-like viruses that roughly matched SARS-CoV.
What indirectly supported this was the fact that no other cases of SARS were reported after all the civets were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV's examination of masked palm civets living in the wild or on farms without exposure to live animal markets was largely negative, suggesting that masked palm civets may be only an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Guangzhou have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals also serve as the amplified intermediate host for SARS-CoV is not excluded.
It seems that all these are hosts that do not transmit SARS-CoV.
A subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV led to the detection of the closely related coronavirus bat, which is called the Chinese horseshoe bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 (the Chinese horseshoe bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
Examination of SARS-CoV antibodies in these bats and the genome sequence of the Chinese horseshoe virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 were positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none could be isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
Human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (angiotensin-2-converting enzyme) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, extracted from a bat feces sample, was shown to use ACE2 in bats, civets, and humans as a cell entry receptor.
Interestingly, the serum of those recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the potential to equalize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the virus most commonly associated with SARS-CoV in bats, as they share 95% homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
An analysis of the evolution of the MERS-CoV strains in the group of coronavirus-HKU4 in bats and coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
The coronavirus-HKU4 virus is used in bats and MERS-CoV the host's own receptor, dipeptide peptidase4 (dipeptide peptidase4), to enter the virus.
Mers-Cove's RNA-dependent polymerase sequences are closer in lineage development to those of bat beta-coronaviruses identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Mers-Cove lives in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and coronavirus-HKU25 in bats closest to it share a nucleotide sequence symmetry of only 87%.
Thus, the host bat may not be the immediate reservoir of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-stranded camels are positive for MERS-CoV equivalent antibodies, as well as camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV matched virus found in humans has been isolated from single humming camel nasal swabs, indicating that camels serve as the original reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appeared in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but heavy viral dispersal was observed.
Infected camels spread the virus significantly not only by breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route for the virus to be scattered from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before symptoms appear, and these cases have been attributed in terms of logic to human-to-human transmission or unknown modes of transmission involving unrecognised animal species harboring MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RaTG13 is involved in bats isolated from horseshoe bats in 96.2% nucleotide homology.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too long to determine the relationship to the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the live repository host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical coronaviruses are found in the future.
The intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 are presumed to be among the wild animal species sold and killed at the Wuhan Seafood Market, which has been associated with several initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the squamous anteater (Manis javanica) could also harbor beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this ant-eater novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% nucleotide sequence symmetry.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They cluster in two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the evolution tree of the strains, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (receptor binding domain) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence matching.
In stark contrast, SARS-CoV-2's receptor binding domains differ significantly from RaTG13's, although the whole genome sequence homology is higher.
A previous study on a sick squamous anteater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which similarly turned out to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various assembly and manual processing methods to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of approximately 86.3% full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the squamous anteater is one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate host animals.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous anteater is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters.
Additionally, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta-CoVs in squamous anteaters.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous anteaters, and other mammals is still under designation.
While the highest sequence homology has been found in the fields of receptor binding between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous ant food, the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 share the highest symmetry of the whole genome sequence.
It is a preponderant speculation that the high degree of similarity between SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domains in squamous anteaters belonging to the beta-coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
There is an antiproposal that suggests recombination between SARS-CoV-2 in the squamous antivore of the beta-coronaviruses and RaTG13 in wild animal species III.
Recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Evidence of the evolution of strains has suggested that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while parent viruses for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Highland Coronavirus) detected in tricolor bats in North America has been reported to be closely related to the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has been found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and the epileptic was also suspected to be its intermediate host.
For illustration, current information on the animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
An analysis of the evolution of strains has provided evidence for cases of interspecies transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species remains less clear.
The bat alpha-coronavirus has been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological habitat.
Humans are closely related to Alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E belonging to bat alpha-coronaviruses is multiple and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha-coronavirus in alpaca causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coronavirus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca was infected with the human coronavirus 229E cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it’s no surprise that bats may transmit the human coronavirus-229E directly to humans.
While alpha-coronaviruses in bats act as gene pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and monophasic camels may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in MERS-CoV.
Mers-Cove provides an excellent example of interspecies transmission, moving from bats to hump-only camels and from hump-only camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Cove has been known from the very beginning of its identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species to exchange genetic pieces within a single species and cross-transmit between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal "virus dispenser".
Mers-Cove, on the other hand, has been moving to monolithic camels for decades.
You may have adapted well to these camels until you switched from an intermediate host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its intermittent transmission to humans remains coincidental and the human being is a non-transporting host for MERS-CoV where its transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of Mers-Cove, the role of squamous anteaters, if any, in the transfer of SARS-Cove-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-coronaviruses associated with squamous anteaters make them very ill.
They may be non-transmissible hosts for SARS-CoV-2 beta-coronaviruses, similar to the civet in SARS-CoV.
Future studies will determine the many possibilities of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animals to humans by either proving or ruling them out.
First, bats may be a reservoir host for a virus associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous anteaters could be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the virus associated with the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2.
Humans become infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming game meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of antibodies in pets and wild animals is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has contact with bats and squamous anteaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, on the viral side there are three main factors that are also important in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to overcome species barriers.
First, their mutation rates are relatively high in RNA replication.
Estimated coronavirus mutation rates, compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average switching rate of 10 to 4 site-to-site swaps each year, depending on the stage of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include a corrective exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, the deletion of which results in extremely high transmissibility and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, the nucleotide isotope remdecifer is known for its ability to inhibit transcription of the coronavirus through inhibition of exogenous ribonuclease enzyme and RNA-based polymerase.
Remdesivir is an anti-SARS-CoV-2 precursor that is to be tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than host rates.
Additionally, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses are not appropriately adapted to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly lower when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
He seems to have already adapted to another human-close host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to single humming camels.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the huge RNA genome in coronaviruses actively provides additional flexibility in genome editing for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become suitable.
This is supported by unique open-read templates and encoded protein functions near the end of the genome's 3x.
Third, coronaviruses switch moulds randomly and repeatedly during RNA replication through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that is like a mixing vessel, sequence switching occurs frequently during transcription of coronavirus RNA.
High-sequence, full-length RNAs and secondary genomics may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
Evidence of the evolution of strains for normal recombination has been discovered in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SARS-like virus in bats and HCoV-HKU9 virus in bats.
Interaction of the virus with the host associated with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor in interspecies transmission.
In this regard, we take SARS-CoV recombination as a typical example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies transitions.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and civets, SARS-CoV was thought to undergo rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the receptor binding domain of S protein.
In general, the S-protein receptor binding domain of the coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain occurs in amino acids 318 to 510 in S1, which is associated with the ACE2 transducer as well as the virus-introducing auxiliary receptors.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding domain is able to identify ACE2 receptors assisting in various animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoons, which allows interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, the remains of only 6 amino acids that were different from the viral isolated samples from humans and civets were observed in the receptor binding domain, 4 of which are in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The K479N and S487T mutations are present in the SARS-CoV receptor binding domain in the civet, which can increase the likelihood of Spike protein interaction in the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
Notably, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein, which implies that the probability of S protein binding in human ACE2 has changed.
Indeed, a study with ultracold electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association compared to that between the human ACE-2 and the SV-SARS-CoV protein.
It's also interesting to determine if any other type of adjuvant receptor may be required for SARS-CoV-2 transport.
It is also interesting that HCoV-NL63 is also bound to the ACE2 but in a different part of the S protein.
Several other HCoV receptors exist, such as the HCoV-229E protein analyzer and the acetylated cyalic acid 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of dependence and host restriction.
The irradiation of these host proteins between humans and hosts of natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, such as bats, single hump camels, and rodents, may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to control host dependency factors and weaken host restriction factors to carry out successful interspecies transmission.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important host-virus interaction space remain detectable and characterization is possible.
Extensive, unbiased genomic screening can be used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 host dependencies and limitations using advanced CRISPR technology.
The emergence of emerging human coronaviruses: back to square one
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats presents abundant opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
By this logic, bat coronaviruses are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and are important points in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein coding genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-associated viruses were isolated in bats but were found to encode differentiated ORF8 proteins.
Sars-Cove's 29 nucleotide deletion properties were found in isolated strains at the start of the human pandemic.
This deletion has split ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of coronaviruses alpha and gamma, with a large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites are also specified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has seen cases of recombination between different strains, which have occurred in Saudi Arabia’s only humpback camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination cases have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs have been synthesized with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which are likely caused by viruses getting rid of selective pressures, such as from the host’s immune system.
The loss of full-length ORF4 protein in the HCoV-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides is an example of these effects.
Although proper ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-coronavirus infects alpaca with single nucleotide stitches, leading to a frame-of-laying mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their repository hosts.
Unsymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases have only been detected when bats are infected with coronaviruses, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
They showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, weak activation of the bat's inflammatory-supportive response effectively reduced the pathogens raised by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cellular activity in bats has been inhibited due to an increased rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cellular receptor and a decreased expression level of the major class I histocompatibility compound molecules.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen-component types (reactive oxygen-component types) arising from the high metabolic activity of bats can lead to both the suppression of coronavirus replication and the effect of correction by exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of highly pathogenic strains of the virus when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They copy strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why carriers of the virus do not show symptoms and the causes of severe cases of human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response is dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
A similar strategy of immune response decoupling may have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 antiretroviral therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, taking interferon type I can benefit at least in the initial stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory particle Krayopyrene NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the inflammatory particle Cryopyrene NLRP3 using the inhibitor MCC950 is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea with which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While it was discovered that the bat beta coronavirus shared SARS-CoV with 95% nucleotide homogeneity, there was also a bat coronavirus that shared 96% of the nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals on the market have been found to harbor SARS-CoV-like viruses, they have not detected direct intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
Beta-coronaviruses have been detected in squamous anteaters that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that squamous anteaters may have been one of the intermediate hosts or that beta-coronaviruses in squamous anteaters may have contributed to the genetic cut-off leading to the final release of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either intentionally or by chance.
Coronaviruses have returned to the spotlight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studying coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our idea of the importance of the origins of zoonotic diseases and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all trace their origin back to the bat and passed on to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that the SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing fresh produce markets and killing civets should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, squamous ant-eaters should be eliminated from fresh produce markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in light of the discovery of multiple lineages of beta-CoVs in squamous ant-eaters that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans, as well as how it is transmitted, through squamous ant-eaters and other mammals remains a topic that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-Cove has been found in long-slung camels.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa region.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS, as officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop repeated outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV camels, as well as other infection control measures.
Because we can’t completely eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with the potential to cause zoonotic diseases are extremely diverse.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of zoonotic coronaviruses, leading to new, more transmissible and/or deadly coronaviruses in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In light of the trials experienced by humanity due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, an appropriate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The truth is that a lot of viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread and multiply.
Although bats carry many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the best way to prevent zoonotic viral diseases is to move humans away from the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The mystery of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that need to be answered.
First, if bats transmit the origin virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the squamous anteater, it is important to know the conditions under which bats and squamous anteater animals share a similar ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then the way humans communicate with them should be determined.
Third, if a third species of mammal acts as the true intermediate host, then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous anteaters.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous anteater, or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses are expected to be identified and are nearly identical in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
The “Suspected Case” and “Confirmed Case” criteria need to be updated when diagnosed with COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 (2019) infection, which provided our experience and included appropriate reference information to combat the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidance and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria of “Suspected Case” and “Confirmed Case” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus), which is now officially known as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and has been dubbed SARS-CoV-2-associated coronavirus.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization called COVID-19 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team formulated a quick guideline and published it online in the journal Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has received considerable attention since its publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, issued seven issues in total, with some contexts changing substantially.
Our guidance has now been responded to by Chu and others, who have made a simple step-by-step proposal for monitoring scores based on the clinical trial.
Their efforts have added a new guide to our guidance and become a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the 7th edition (March 3, 2020), the confirmation of the suspected case needs to combine any one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of the clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or it needs to verify three elements of the clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel to Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 symptoms have been reported, or residence, within the last 14 days before symptoms begin; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected areas (with positive DNA test results); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan, surrounding areas, or other communities where you have reported
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with characteristics demonstrated by imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing a normal, low, or low level of lymphocyte count in the early stage of infection.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case involving any of the elements of evidence of pathogen or serum reactions as follows: (1) positive BCR test result in real time SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive IgM and IgG test results for SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or
We see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test of the DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added to the second version (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); the guide to serum interactions was then added to the seventh release.
These modifications built on the researchers’ ongoing work to design an ideal DNA detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of the positive outcome of the specific antibody to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is growing evidence that we need to be cautious when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and non-symptom conditions.
Therefore, the content of the flow chart should be updated for Cho et al., where they classified the clinically symptom-free person as "low risk".
The grading monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope to access more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their comments.
To diagnose a “suspected case” and a “confirmed case,” we call for the most up-to-date guidance from people’s home countries to be tracked and adhered to.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, highest daily rate
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that, as of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries had been recorded.
There have been 17 deaths.
The director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirgadi Sabrina Flora, stated in an online press conference that the deaths involved four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirgadi, there were two cases aged over 60, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41 and 50.
She also said that two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Authority, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaid Al Qader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would be halted for longer than initially planned until Saturday.
Public transport disruption initially began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of basic commodities is still allowed: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people who had returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one of them.
All three had already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has exceeded 2 million worldwide
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day Malawi confirmed the first cases of coronavirus, and the first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News, citing Johns Hopkins University data, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by the coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Mr. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, announced that the city's closure period had been extended until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfews in the cities of Mecca and Medina to all day long, previously from 3 p.m. to just 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australia stores reduce toilet paper purchase limits per transaction
Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles on Saturday and Sunday evening tightened restrictions on toilet paper purchases to reduce them to two Woolworths rolls and one Coles roll per transaction at all branches nationwide.
Aldi's stores also identified one roll, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
It has been reported that buyers have been stockpiling it due to COVID-19-related concerns in case people need self-isolation.
Wallworths on Wednesday introduced restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes, making one roll per order.
The changes follow previous restrictions introduced by Woolworths stores on March 4 and Coles stores on March 5 allowing only four rolls per transaction.
In its March 8 media release, Coles reported that despite the four-roll restrictions, “many stores are still selling all they have within one hour of receiving it,” and described the order as “unprecedented,” as well as Aldi’s in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unexpected.”
Sales increased "significantly" in the past week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths stores.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also specified that the amount allowed to be purchased was two rolls.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger rolls from suppliers and delivery increased, and Woolworths ordered additional stock, while Aldi made its inventory available for Wednesday’s specials early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck deliveries made it difficult.
High production costs are expected, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi Stores announced that due to the early availability of stock, some stores would not be able to offer a Wednesday special.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report for News.com.au that stores fill up stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold completely, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which enhances the feeling of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman reported, as reported by ABC News, that: "Cools and Woolworths stores have a view that [that] if a lot of goods are available on the shelves, and if products like toilet rolls and sanitizers can be [purchased] and supplied in large quantities, that might reduce panic."
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, said Wednesday that its stock has run out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberley-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent, have confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, noted that some real estate sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions have been held due to buyers stopping work on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily publication in Darwin City, featured eight-page flyers made so they could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores initially hesitated about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, with stores saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including gags, sanitizers, dry goods, hand washes and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado limits purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 – a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 – has reached pandemic level.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, not the seriousness of specific cases, WHO has pointed out the need to push governments to take the necessary measures:
“All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “If countries detect, screen, treat and isolate people, they will be tracked and mobilized to confront.”
“We are all very concerned about alarming levels of prevalence and severity as well as alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
As CNN reported in February, “No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than influenza.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by one of the coronaviruses."
“And we’ve never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the WHO’s decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “The bottom line is that things are going to get worse.”
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide as of Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The death rate in China was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining interpersonal distance, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected.
Authorities around the world are responding to this threat with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global social and economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have either been closed nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese and other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and other areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, reported a range of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, squamous ant-eater coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person to develop symptoms contracted the disease on December 1, 2019, and this person had no clear contact with the subsequently discovered wet market group.
Of the group of early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Journal suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that although new cases in China had been reported, they had suddenly risen in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases within them for the first time.
There may be a significant under-reporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with adults aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of Britons would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases indicate the number of people tested for COVID-19 and confirmed as per official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies regarding not testing only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China, as of January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of the recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China as of February 5 were in those over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The true number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without being tested – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of COVID deaths recorded by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States acknowledged that "we know that [the reported number of deaths] reflects an underestimation", a statement supported by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the United States. Such underestimation occurs in pandemic situations such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
The first death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health. The mortality-to-injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of fatality from injuries dropped from 17.3% (for those who developed symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who developed symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other metrics refer to case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who died from the disease, and infection fatality rate (AFR), which reflects the percentage of people who became ill and died from the disease.
These statistics have no time frame and track a specific population from infection to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific population groups.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall infection death rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomised test of COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effect of the test in case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of an outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Bonney of Pennsylvania State University stated: "Usually outbreaks of infectious diseases that are left unattended peak and then begin to decline when the disease finds no available hosts.
“But it’s almost impossible to come to any reasonable expectation right now about the timing of that.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it "could be finished by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to halt the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kocharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will be prevalent probably for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of scientist Neil Ferguson, we will have to rely on physical spacing and other measures "until a vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, “I think it’s unlikely that this coronavirus will go away completely – because it’s easily transmissible,” and it could “turn into a seasonal disease – so that it comes back every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively nonspecific and may not show symptoms in sufferers.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (sputum), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, puffing, diarrhea, or cyanosis. The World Health Organization confirms that approximately one in six people are severely ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) restricts emergency symptoms to difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden disorientation, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. Worsening the progression of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute shortness of breath syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some patients with no clinical symptoms may not show symptoms, but the results of the tests confirm their injury, so specialists have provided advice that contacts of confirmed cases should be monitored and closely examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the olfactory rate of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was estimated at 30% and recently fell to 15%.
Details of how the disease will spread are still being discussed.
The disease is thought to spread mainly during mixing or through splashing when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 m (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth can result in a spray spread from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some argue that the virus may also be transmitted by aerosols trapped in the air for a long time, which may be produced while speaking. Respiratory aerosols may also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally airborne.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of people nearby or be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may release respiratory secretions in the form of a spray and then cause them to spread through the air.
It may also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about possible fecal-oral spread, this risk is thought to be limited.
The government of China has denied that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from feces to the mouth. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms indicating the possibility of transmission before the onset of severe symptoms.
There are few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three more in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to be infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as is the case when touching other surfaces that may have been touched by an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who had pneumonia in contact with a group of cases of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all its characteristics with coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, dissolving its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus genetically corresponds to the genus of the coronavirus beta, and falls under the subgenus of the coronavirus sarpy (b strain) as well as two strains originating from bats.
It matches up to 96% at the whole genome level with other samples of bat coronaviruses (Pat cove rat G13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one amino acid variation in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses originating from squamous anteaters and viruses originating from humans.
Comparing the entire genome to date has resulted in the discovery of a maximum of 92% shared genetic material between the squamous ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, an insufficient proportion to prove that the squamous ant-eater is the intermediate host of this virus.
HIV infection can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately done by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction and CT indicated that CT is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other disease stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider it as a preliminary diagnostic test."
The World Health Organization (WHO) published several protocols for testing SARS-CoV-2 RNA for the first time on January 17.
The test uses a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally performed with a nasopharyngeal swab, and a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies develop serum tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently accurate to adopt their widespread use.
A serological test developed by CELEX has been certified for emergency use in the United States in accredited laboratories only.
Imaging features for radiographs and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral opacity such as sintered glass fog and blurry crystalline leaching.
The Italian Radiation Society collects an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without polymerase chain reaction is a limited-precision procedure for detecting COVID-19 because of its overlap with other diseases such as adenovirus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of computed chest to polymerase chain reaction and demonstrated that while imaging is less accurate in terms of proving injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it should be considered a screening tool in endemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based transversal neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then discarding it directly into the trash.
Those who already carry the infection are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical spacing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers who care for a potentially infected person are advised to use appropriate measures, mixing precautions, and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an effective way to help health authorities identify the source of infection and prevent outbreaks.
The use of mobile location data by governments for the purpose of tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
Many mobile apps have been designed or developed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have been working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing the nose and gargle with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is still no vaccine for COVID-19, although several organizations have been working on a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommended using at least a 60% alcohol hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using several disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the surface of stainless steel), including; ethanol 62-71%, isopropanol 50-100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2-7.5%.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, exist less effectively.
The CDC recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in a facility such as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, and shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing by either bending the elbow and placing it in front of the mouth and nose or by using a paper napkin and discarding any napkins immediately.
Those who are likely to be injured are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it is scattered due to talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce [people's] desire to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned." People who are likely to get sick are recommended to use masks.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as those caring for a COVID-19 patient, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing a non-medical cloth face mask. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially if they are in direct contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out into public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam required everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government made it mandatory for anyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel required all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that train passengers and intercity buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it necessary to wear a face mask when going out, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without touching, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently enforce or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 outbreak was detected in the area) to 50 people, and 10 later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those suffering from chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious illnesses and complications and the CDC has advised them to stay at home as much as possible in areas of outbreak between communities.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health directives for use during a pandemic.
This includes recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those who suspect it.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued for those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who have had contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widespread have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling outbreaks are containment or suppression and limiting spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Retardation requires stricter measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base reproductive number to less than 1. Part of managing infectious disease outbreaks is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the flattening of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health service stress and saves more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmacological interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks, and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures, such as cleaning surfaces.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and local quarantine, and issued alerts about the movements of the injured.
Singapore provided financial support to the injured who isolated themselves and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased mask production and criminalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing rather than stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce peak health-care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strain health systems.
Braking may be preferable but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this happens first), as transmission on the other hand quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic has social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids and resting may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care centres to provide for COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as essential measures to respond to outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating elective procedures where possible, separating and isolating people with COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of artificial respirators and beds available.
Multiple theories exist as to where the first case originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei had gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animal species; in other words, it has an animal origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Ven, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Cases of pneumonia unknown to Wuhan health authorities were reported enough that the investigation began in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by movements during the Chinese New Year and because Wuhan is a transportation hub and the junction point of major railway lines.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data announced later show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dead and more than 364,000 recovering.
At least 200 countries and territories have registered at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National responses included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, place-in-place orders, or closures) and curfews. As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, had undergone some form of closure in the United States, over 50 million had undergone closure in the Philippines, about 59 million had undergone closure in South Africa, and 1.3 billion had undergone closure in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent some form of closure, a number that rose to 2.6 billion two days later – about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates from 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jiejian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, and subsequently reported to her hospital to the Center for Disease Control in Jianghan, Wuhan on December 27.
An initial genetic test of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
In the presence of these notices, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was "no clear evidence" of person-to-person transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Communist Party of China General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a health levee was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicles were banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, Lishenshan Hospital, to deal with the additional patients.
In addition to the newly established hospitals, China has also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including introducing health announcements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Teleworking measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Restrictions were imposed on travel in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums were temporarily closed across China.
Public mobility has been tightly controlled in several cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) have been subjected to some form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from being “infiltrated” from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all those returning to the city from other countries. On March 23, one case has moved locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of the outbreak in China were decreasing.
Travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from March 28 onwards, with no specific details on when this policy would expire.
Those wishing to enter China will have to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to resume work on March 30, and introduced a monetary incentive package for businesses. The State Council declared a three-minute day of mourning on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government required families to show online respect for physical distance to avoid another COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have moved from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheongji Jesus Church.
It is suspected that followers of Shincheongji visiting Daegu from Wuhan are the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 people, or about 13% of the 9,336 adherents of the church, have reported symptoms. South Korea announced its highest alert levels on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight times were also affected, and changed. South Korea implemented a program that was considered the largest and best organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected as well as track those who came into contact and quarantine them.
Screening methods included mandatory in-person reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, in-vehicle testing of people with test results available the next day, and increased testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program represents success in controlling the outbreak despite not applying quarantine to entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either demanding Moon’s removal, alleging the government mishandled the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad would be subject to quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests from 121 different countries to help test for the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 19 in Qom, with two people dying later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani stated on February 26, 2020 that there is no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued before the Persian New Year.
Shia shrines remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became a center for the spread of the virus during February after China.
Amid allegations of Iranian cover-up, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases back from Iran beginning on February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak may exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to date.
Iran's parliament has been shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly infected with the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release eligible prisoners.
She stated that there is a high risk of the virus spreading indoors such as in detention centers, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current and former Iranian politicians and government officials have died of the disease by 17 March.
By 23 March, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of cases in Iran may be up to five times what has been announced.
It is also believed that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the country’s financial capacity to respond to the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for an easing of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came back positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "It will not be allowed to enter or exit the outbreak areas.
It has already been ordered to suspend work activities and sporting events in those areas." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country as deaths in Italy reached 100.
All major sporting events, including Serie A matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sporting events were suspended entirely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Anesthesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 deaths were reported due to the pandemic.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, mostly in the Lombardy region.
A combination of a large number of elderly people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high death rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against unnecessary travel or social contact, suggesting people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, promising to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a maximum of GBP 2,500 per month to reduce unemployment in a time of crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and activity outside the home except as a matter of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of "essential" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations, and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington for a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on the entry of travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the CDC – the U.S. government’s leading public health institute – announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. slowed the start of testing, obscuring the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test corrupted a flawed test set produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal government approval for non-government test sets (by academia, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (a doctor's order was required thereafter).
By February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who experienced symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days to be tested."

On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, several companies have shut down or reduced their operating hours across the United States in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By 17 March, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. On 23 March, 10,700 cases of coronavirus were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing appeared to have been a success, with estimates showing a slowdown in cases doubling from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people had died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases had been confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people had died.
According to media reports on March 30, US President Trump decided to extend the social distancing directive until April 30.
That same day, USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1,000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 coronavirus deaths within 24 hours.
In New York State, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public statements and publications related to the virus with Vice President Mike Pence's office.
The Trump administration’s overall approval rating for the crisis was not as favorable as it was, as it was, a broad polarization between parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S. reliance on imports of essential items, including basic medical supplies, from China.
The analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict prevalence patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from the International Air Transport Association 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the highest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for travellers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported as the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered more capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on 7 February.
Not much has been discovered about COVID-19, and Australia will emphasize border control and communications in its response to the pandemic, she said.
On 21 March, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
As public transport has been affected by effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has announced that it will not evacuate any of its citizens from China.
On 7 February, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members in addition to four Poles, one Chinese person, and one Indian citizen.
Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked from the plane in Poland, where the Brazilian plane stopped before resuming its route to Brazil.

On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first plane and 39 from a second plane chartered by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan to Canadian Forces Base Trenton to be quarantined for two weeks.
On February 11, another plane carrying 185 Canadians landed from Wuhan at Canadian Forces Base Trenton.
On 3 and 4 February, Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens to the Christmas Island detention centre, which was repurposed as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on 5 February, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were isolated at a naval base in Wangabarawa, north of Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate Americans who were aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On February 21, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airlines plane chartered by the South African government repatriated 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical examination was conducted, and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left to mitigate the risks.
Only South Africans whose test results were negative were returned.
Test results proved that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a precaution, all remained under surveillance and quarantine at Ranch Resort for 14 days, were uninjured.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.
On 5 February, China's Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad, Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities banded together to send aid to infected areas in China, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. Humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and hospital workers' clothing, via the Air Emergency Bridge, to Wuhan Union Hospital by January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, along with protecting “at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.”
Interaxion reported that the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send China $2.26 million in aid.
Japan donated one million face masks to Wuhan, Turkey sent medical equipment, Russia sent more than 13 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan, Malaysia announced the donation of 18 million medical gloves to China, Germany delivered several medical supplies including 10,000 protective suits, the United States donated 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China, and promised to provide other financial support of 100 million dollars to the affected countries.
In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with its coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he distributed them to the African Union.
He later sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and five respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 test kits for the coronavirus made in China that were only 30% accurate, while the Netherlands returned 600,000 face masks made in China that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks that were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed Chinese aid well received. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of obfuscation that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government provided "regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday."
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gooden Gallia noted that while this was "certainly not a recommendation made by the WHO", it was "a very important indicator of commitment to contain the epidemic where it is heavily concentrated", describing it as "an unprecedented international public health emergency in the history of public health".
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern due to “the risk of global spread, particularly in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems”.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and mobility."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds set up in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that “do not have systems to detect people living with the virus, even if it emerges.”
Tedros also made statements in which he declared that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest among us" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay a big price later".
On the same day, Tedros reported that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to present "the full potential of the UN system in responding".
As a result, a UN crisis management team has been set up, allowing the entire UN response to be coordinated, and WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while the experience of other agencies can be leveraged to see the broader social, economic, and development impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team with China was prepared to bring international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist with local management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO announced that "the world should do more to prepare for the potential pandemic of the coronavirus pandemic," noting that "the world should be at a prior stage."
In response to the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level for warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s health emergency programme, warned in a statement that “this is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to prepare.
This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it,” he urged, urging the right response measures that could help the world avoid “worse.”
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "we fundamentally accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the World Health Organization (WHO) was “deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and levels of inaction.” The WHO has faced strong criticism for what is seen as inadequate treatment of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency, and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be a justification for discrimination against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, persons belonging to minorities, older persons, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extremely poor conditions, and detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The OECD has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
From strengthening health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the Digital Hub includes a state policy tracking tool, designed to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Edward Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of CCP directors have been fired at the cross-sectional level for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe that the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, have rejected an earlier admission that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the COVID-19 virus.
The US administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China "has imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic", which has been criticized by some critics for being racist and "distracting [the attention] from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable reviewing the communications blueprint with clear sources at the National Security Council, stating a strategy that "everything is about China.
We were asked to seek and spread these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances." News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global impact.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of a "geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through the practice of detours and policies of generosity".
“China is strongly pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner,” Borrell said.
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid intended for other countries back home.
There have been reported mask-related disputes between other nations, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of artificial respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Mauretsu Masari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said, "It is only China that has responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper quoted an unnamed "high-ranking political source" as saying 80 percent of Russia's aid was "unhelpful or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of initiating a remarkable "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
Lombardi's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are active again, they will also be able to give back if necessary."
NATO's planned "Cannon 2020" military exercises will take place in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war games since the end of the Cold War on a small scale.
"Under the current public health crisis, training endangers not only the lives of troops from the United States and many participating European countries but also the populations of the countries in which they will be conducted," said Kit Hudson, Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as fifteen other former or current political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020 asking for help, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government locations for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for Moon’s removal because they claimed the government had mishandled the outbreak or praised his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency legislation under the response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tighten their grip on power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for numerous supply shortages due to the increasing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption to plant operation and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier outages.
Many areas also saw panic buying, resulting in shelves devoid of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a shortage of supplies.
The tech industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand caused prices to rise as much as twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed by between four and six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protection tools around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has opened up a new opportunity for Diago shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite widespread COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived severe food shortages.
Actions by China and Italy to combat the stockpiling and illicit trade of vital products have averted the expected acute food shortages in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural output, did not see a significant decline, but prices could rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for residents.
Similar laws in Italy require food producers to keep stocks for such contingencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 by government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been noted that the outbreak of the virus poses a significant destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit expected markets to remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of the likely outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic repercussions of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those that occurred as a result of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to have experienced a “disorder” after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets tumbled on Feb. 24 due to a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with the Dow down 1,191 points, its biggest one-day decline since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three indicators ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, Scoop Ratings GMBH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but kept the negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the coronavirus, and the biggest drop was on March 16.
Many believe a recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public spaces including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments to travel around the world.
As a result, several airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern and Kents, while the British regional airline, Flybe, has collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry has been at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The pandemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events with large crowds, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private companies also closing their stores independently and attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, and instructed most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. The global retail sector has been affected by a reduction in shop hours or temporary closure.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This also led to a 33-43 percent drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing cleanliness, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would otherwise be the case.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who earn salaries through daily wages) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since it closed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers on government-backed short-term work plans known as corzarbet.
France and Britain adopted a German short-term work compensation scheme.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals – working and independent – globally.
The arts and culture sector institutions have sought to support their (often government-funded) mission to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, keep their employees and the public safe, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent rapid repercussions of the disease include the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a hiatus. The Vatican announced the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian Lent season.
Many parishes recommended that older Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches made church services available via radio, live streaming or television while others offered worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and then closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the biggest disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Super League, the 2020 Europa League, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July, and the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021".
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as those on Broadway suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streaming concerts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their work.
Many Internet memes about the coronavirus have spread on the Internet as much has turned to humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by various groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserved the virus or were receiving what was claimed to be justifiable punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also been on the rise in some African countries.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There has been support for Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
As the outbreak spreads to new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could be subject to scepticism and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to pressure to stop the Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag ChineseDontComeToJapan is released on Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US reported increasing levels of racial abuse, as well as assaults.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus," a term that critics have viewed as racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners being evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China and is studying in major Indian cities, have faced harassment over the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party unit in West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them "wrong." In China, the pandemic has led to growing xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers have removed paid pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made outbreak-related scientific papers available for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for COVID-19 and its associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is accurate and only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) is used for diagnosis and population control.
Antibody tests show how many people have the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or those who don't.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity in the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
As of 23 March, no country has examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to have a significant impact on reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using the reverse transcriptase polymerase reaction (RRT-PCR) the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including a nasopharyngeal swab or a sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR performed using throat swabs is only relied upon in the first week of illness.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people who are undergoing screening in the second week, a deep airway sample may instead be taken via a suction catheter or cough (sputum) material.
One of BCR’s early tests was created at the Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using the reverse transcriptional polymerase reaction (RRT-PCR), and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created a SARS-Coronavirus (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit suitable for safe, BCR-based clinical use on January 28, 2020.
Looking for the "E" gene shared by all SARS-CoV-2 beta coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the China National Medical Products Administration for a BCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes a CDC-specific diagnostic panel for COVID-19.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and one of the test stages was later than the others at CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully tested throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not trusted until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved testing under emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, Lab Corp announced that COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide based on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made it possible to test COVID-19 nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling must be performed and processed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the state center for virology and biotechnology research Victor created and produced the COVID-19 test.
On February 11, 2020, the FDA registered the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted permission for emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct testing on the M2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously granted similar permission to Heologic, Lab Corp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sifed received a similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses isothermal DNA amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing for 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically linked to the novel coronavirus nuclear capsid protein, hoping to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "chest radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computerized tomography] results may be evident even before symptoms appear".
Typical features that appear in CT scans include multi-lobed double-sided sintered glass opacity with an asymmetrical, circumferential and posterior distribution.
The spread develops under the pleura and shows irregular patches and condenses as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT in relation to the origin of the current pandemic indicated that CT was more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other stages of disease.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or to consider it as an initial screening to diagnose the disease." In March 2020, CDC recommends using BCR for the initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect an individual's infection within a period of 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population control. The tests can be done in Central Laboratory (CLT) or by clinical point of care (POCT) testing.
High-performance robotic systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although successive samples may be used to monitor the immune response.
For a clinical point-of-care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by piercing the skin.
Unlike BCR methods, the extraction step does not need to be performed prior to testing. On 26 March 2020, the FDA identified 29 entities that have submitted a notification to the agency in accordance with the requirements and are therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved only one test under its emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test accomplishes several hundred samples in a matter of hours and is therefore much faster than traditional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it had purchased were not good enough to use.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which suspected patients can stay at home, "give the emergency department a patient sample tube", spit in the tube, and return it again to get the test result after a short period. The British National Health Service (NHS) has announced that it is piloting a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus eliminating the risk of infection from infected patients when they come to the hospital or need to sterilize the ambulance used.
In-car testing centers have enabled South Korea to perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it was able to perform around 12,000 outpatient tests per day and 10,700 people were tested in the past week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-car testing for the virus was made available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, as only positive case results have been announced.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting in calendar week 2000/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested in the E.G.I.U. sample in the English language by the end of the week 12/2020, 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital devised a method for testing samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and tested this method only positively.
With BGI founder Wang Jian overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do so, modelling showed that cases in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the related quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capability had not been achieved.
Wuhan Lab immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai and in 12 cities in total across China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays has released open source, multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 with just 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, a shortage and inadequacy of reagents caused trouble when a large number of tests were carried out in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for five minutes to edit the DNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE is at the top of the world in terms of the rate of coronavirus testing of its population, and is on track to upgrade the testing procedure to reach most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating in-car testing capability, and purchasing a high-throughput lab with a population-friendly range from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection labs in China).
The lab was set up within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first lab of this size to operate outside of China.
Different methods of testing targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been devised in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan to make crews that are sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until January 28, delaying testing available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test crews early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough crews to meet demand and follow recommendations for testing made by health experts.
Experts say the abundance of testing in South Korea has helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced the testing capacity of private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for intensified testing programs as the best solution to curb the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private U.S. laboratories, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents were scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, "flaws" were found in test kits devised by CDC; hence the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or improper use of crews.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will withdraw the purchase of the kits that gave incorrect results, and will replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed dumping them into the Danube. Professor H Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had "prevented their use". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, which were followed by a quarantine of those who tested positive and followed those who had contact with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which saw the first COVID-19 death in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, taking about 10 days at a time.
About half of the people tested positive showed no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on inter-town traffic, new infections have been completely eliminated.
Singapore’s 2020 coronavirus pandemic has seen a significant drop in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities through strict contact tracing and restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already started urging residents to stay indoors on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 on time after the holiday expired.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries with more tests than deaths have much lower case fatality rates, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct testing or have local laboratories with limited expertise on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO-accredited laboratories to confirm testing.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "positive % of tests" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only tests for people who are hospitalized will have about 100% more positive cases than a country that tests for its entire population, whether it shows symptoms or not, on the basis of other factors being equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constantly washing hands with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as the flu or a cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five essential moments during the day when handwashing with soap is important include before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers for a child or cleaning them after using the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, their feed, or their droppings.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrheal infections, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of reduced episodes of diarrhea can be associated with handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when auto-behavior is applied in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the leading cause of death among children under five, claiming the lives of about 1.8 million children annually.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause about 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against herpes transmitted by direct physical contact.
A simple detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin due to its dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of flaking and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Too much hand washing is also often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five necessary moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the baby's butt (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Proper hand washing should be practiced in other cases to prevent transmission, such as before or after treating a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States approached the middle at 77%, and China at the lowest at 23%. Many behavior change methodologies now exist to increase the use of handwashing behavior with soap at the necessary times.
The "Basic Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of widespread action to promote children's health and education.
Treating worms twice a year, as well as daily handwashing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water promotes the removal of micro-organisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstacles of dissolution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective disinfectant for the skin because lipids and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not readily decompose in water.
However, the flow of a proper amount of water helps to cleanse.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed bacterial transmission of contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is unlikely because bacteria are laundered with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to state that "liquid soap is preferred from devices that operate without touching to pump soap."
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sterilizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap doesn’t affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed to be.
Along with a surfactant and skin protection agent, sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acid regulator and other anti-microbial active benzoic acid and skin moisturizers (cactus, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that regular hand soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps in the consumer category.
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that retain dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol hand cleaners that are not water-based and sterilized through rubbing (also known as alcohol-based hand lotion, hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol compound with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the dehydration effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing alcohol by at least 60-95% are effective bactericidal.
Alcoholic sanitizers by rubbing eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant intestinal components), tuberculosis, certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, snout, influenza, hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic sanitizers containing 70% alcohol through rubbing kill 99.97% (a logarithmic reduction of 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (a logarithmic reduction of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcohol hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) viruses, which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. Enough hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol should be used to wet or completely cover both hands.
Rub the front and back of the hands and between all the fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
Finger tips should also be thoroughly washed, and rubbed into both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizer rub, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and quick activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless you add emollients, moisturizers, or both to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin, other emollients, or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives found in alcoholic hand lotion materials rarely occurs.
The reduced susceptibility to the occurrence of irritable contact dermatitis has become an attraction factor compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly less than that of alcohol-based rubbing.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent antimicrobial effect after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to gradual reverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with micro-organisms they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, like soap, is also a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands well when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
It creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and it removes more germs for longer periods of time.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinse hands inside the pelvis may re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most commonly overlooked parts are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain micro-organisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, as dry skin can damage them, which can increase the risk of transmission.
Various low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water and/or soap are not available, such as pouring water from a suspended bowl or swirling with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as “Tibi taps” and other low-cost options.
Tipi tap is a simple technique that uses a hanging jug with a rope, and a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of hand hygiene, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests that paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium for Paper Towels, to compare the levels of hygiene provided by paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and newer jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by 77%.
The jet air dryer, which pushes air out of the unit at speeds of up to 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and device, and may transmit infection to other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant prevalence of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study carried out by T-V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated the methods of drying different hands.
The following changes in the numbers of bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative while traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignatius Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands in case they forget.
One study found lower rates of infection with their use.
Medical hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using copious amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers tangled.
If there is litter under the fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove them.
Because germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to seal the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in a health care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors forgetting to routinely wash their hands before touching patients, transmitting microorganisms.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%, and the World Health Organization has published a journal explaining the way hands are washed and rubbed in health care sectors.
A draft guidance document for hand hygiene provided by the organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
Whitby et al. conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
The World Health Organization has “five moments” to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before the sterilization mission,
After caring for patients. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soaps ("medical" or "anti-microbial") imparts an exterminating ingredient to the handwashing agent.
This genocidal element may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. When someone's hands are "rubbed" for surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching their hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine lotion, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, a sterile scrub brush, and another sterile cleaning tool is required under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water from the forearms to the hands should be prevented.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it's best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staph infection in hospitals, the greatest benefit of manual disinfection was found to come from the first 20% of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to over 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing rubbing hands with an alcohol solution with washing hands with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But water and soap are more effective than alcohol handwashing to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and difficile spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may include educating employees about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol handwashing, and written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as an essential and affordable tool for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps are rarely found near every private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be the result of ingrained habits rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in lower-middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting handwashing in schools is the “three-star approach” designed by UNICEF to encourage schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can go from one star up to eventually three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that attempt to achieve behaviour change. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have looked at the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to disability-adjusted life years.
However, one review suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation procedures.
The importance of handwashing to human health – especially for people in critical conditions such as mothers who were just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignats Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
Most people at the time still believed the infection was caused by unpleasant odors called miasmaz.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health care-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more effective hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
Swine flu outbreaks in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect oneself from these infectious diseases.
For example, “right ways to wash your hands” posters were hung next to hand-washing tubs in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
“Handwashing from” means declaring one’s unwillingness to take responsibility for the object or to participate in complicity in it.
It stems from a biblical passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase of much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to over-wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse a fantasy-making spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she has committed and the crimes she has urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after pointing out or thinking about unethical actions, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate handwashing tools more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to engage in other “purification” compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions describe handwashing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the handwashing rituals that have emerged in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tefilah, handwashing in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also require healthy handwashing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies to risk controls for the prevention of COVID-19.
Proper risk controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and job function, based on an assessment of the risk of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the general public and other co-workers, a situation in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including handwashing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette, and maintaining standard practices for cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Jobs with moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but who may become infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have reached out to the general public, such as in schools, high-intensity work environments, and some large-scale retail outlets.
Risk controls for this group include, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, sneezing barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in the case of a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers health care and mortuary workers who are exposed to a known or suspected COVID-19 victim to have high levels of exposure risk, which increases the risk of very high exposure if workers are performing aerosol-generating procedures, or collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 victim.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls such as passive pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, needing to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of both the quality of goods ordered and the methods of obtaining them (e.g. off-peak shopping, delivery services or shopping without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may cease. An infection-causing disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the controls needed to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Infection-causing disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
Outbreak response goals include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the society in which the business is located influences the responses taken.
The hierarchy of risk control controls is a framework widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Because COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes in employment policy or procedures that require action on the part of the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, the correct fit as appropriate (e.g. respirators), wear continuously and correctly, regularly checked, maintained and replaced, as necessary, removed, cleaned and stored, or properly disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower risk exposures involve minimal communication with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing cough and sneeze etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper napkins and garbage containers, preparing to work remotely or organizing shifts sequentially if necessary, dissuading workers from using other people’s tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illnesses stay at home until fever, fever signs, and other symptoms are gone for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-lowering or other medications that improve symptoms, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, moderate-risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but who may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the community surrounding the workplace, or because the person has recently made international travel to a location where COVID-19 transmission is common.
This includes workers who come into contact with the general public such as in schools, high-intensity work environments, and some high-volume workplaces. Engineering controls and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezes, and installing windows to serve customers who do not leave the vehicle. Administrative controls and high-risk groups may encourage sick workers to stay home and set up face-to-face meetings.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on an airplane, appropriate protective controls to protect workers and other passengers include removing the sick passenger from others by 6 feet, mandating one member of the airplane team to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be disposed of in a biohazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces must then be cleaned and sterilized. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person’s cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is a small to medium transmission limit in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, band lessons, or canteen meals, increasing distances between offices, organizing consecutive attendance times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the community, as well as strategies for social distancing, extended school departures can be considered. For law enforcement officers performing routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must communicate with individuals confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before reuse with a spray or household cleaning mop, and follow standard operating procedures to deal with contamination and dispose of personal protective equipment used to collect and wash clothes.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, some health care and mortuary workers fall into categories with high or very high levels of risk.
High-risk jobs include health care providers, support, labs, and medical transport who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become extremely high risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures, as well as collecting or handling samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
The functions of a high-risk mortuary include personnel involved in the preparation of the bodies of persons confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these persons become extremely high-risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized passive pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and to save dead bodies.
Samples are to be handled following Level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those operating within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, respirators with a N95 filter, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, should be used in the context of the comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes composition and suitability testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted by body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only the use of a surgical mask for examination staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect breath samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any aerosol-generating procedures, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, goggles, face guard, siren and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 breathing mask.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using PPE needed only for the specific task, and continuing to use the same breathing mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE for those who are not.

We have found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become something that clearly demonstrates the global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response depends on the kind of global empathy, collaboration and community building that are embedded at the heart of this institution.
The intense and caring friendship we have seen among all of our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is an amazing demonstration of the amazing human feelings that, fortunately, surround our way of doing business.
I am extremely grateful and deeply proud to have you as true colleagues.
Last week, someone sent me a letter expressing appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how critical it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism of this critical resource remaining online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it’s keeping the sites running, getting our colleagues paid, or providing safety for our communities.
The world needs the information available on Wikipedia more than ever.
It’s a moment when the positive impact in the world is not only on the efforts we make, but also on the way we make them.
Because of the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make major adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the modus operandi and schedules
As Rubin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought could be the appropriate response to what we face, and the ideal way to sustain the organization’s business during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our mission in the long run.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working time is 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We’re not announcing a holiday, so if you’re able to work longer than normal hours, your efforts may add up to the task.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your times.
If you are sick, don’t work.
Allowing this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it emphatically.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor positively diagnoses you with COVID-19, please tell Brian at the Training and Certification Department so that the Training and Certification Department can help provide support and make sure you receive appropriate management care.)
Fellows working hourly are paid in full.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our hourly colleagues.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Too many people are taking advantage of work to overcome the pressures of the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during difficult times like this.
Again, it’s about taking care of oneself.
We only ask that you communicate with your manager so that he or she knows what to expect and adjusts the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some actions are necessary.
There are also some things that we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR processes, trust, honesty, fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may need further support.
We will begin a process in collaboration with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There’s a lot of work to be done for all of us, and we’ll focus on the most important projects.
Going slower now, it won't hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double down” after the pandemic.
We are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We accept the fact that those circumstances have changed, and will work to set new goals and timetables as and when appropriate.
What happens in annual planning (APP)?
To cope with the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our annual planning delivery schedule for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while aligning those who need or want to work on a reduced-hours schedule over the next few weeks.
This schedule extension eases current planning workloads and pressure across the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the annual planning team for its leading role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
We learned last week that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, out of extreme caution and prohibition, we employed a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used the hospital-grade anti-virus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units leading to our floor.
The building has implemented its duty of care protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable that the office is properly prepared until the time we decide to return to work.
Our Washington, D.C. office is housed in a building belonging to WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with all members of the staff at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our Washington, D.C. office moved to an entirely remote location under the joint direction of our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues at our headquarters in New York City know, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
Those discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues know it might be an adjustment, and they’ve wanted to give you some advice:
Meetings should be limited to a maximum of one hour or a gradual increase of up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, think about how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda prepared, and reading materials sent in advance.
Video should be made the default solution, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, with one person monitoring the conversation for questions, keeping track of the speaker list, and another to help with taking notes (or carrying out a collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when comfortable headphones are needed.
A health and safety compensation program can be used to get the cost of snacks.
You can join the Slack channel to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is looking for guidance for user-friendly elements based on online meetings, to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Last week, we asked all community grantees to cancel all Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Editathon, until the World Health Organization declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete agreed grant activities, and that no one will be fined for having to delay or modify these goals.
Next week we will be releasing additional follow-up guidance related to Wikimedia and other regional community-based and topic-specific conferences.
The public sentiment that pervades the global community is floundering between grief over the disruption, and satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Going forward, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up on all communications with them.
Stay up-to-date on COVID-19-related topics
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 PST for the working group meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, respond to questions and spend time communicating between us.
We have this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we may continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary COVID-19-related information available on the Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also maintaining regular contacts with workers residing in severely affected States.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to let us know and cooperate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to support and communicate as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes shall be considered a waiver of our work or obligations.
Instead, it’s a realization in this moment, that our work and our commitments are more likely to adapt in a way we’ve never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our people with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they rely on.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes to complete it.
Now is the time to help each other and create a space for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to make this happen, and that’s why we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when the time comes.
Please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Catherine, director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doreen D., Gregory V., Jamie V., Joel L., Lynette L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I., Heather W., Jamie V., Janine U., Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby N.).
ACE2 binds to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as intestines.
ACE 2 counteracts the action of ACE by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is also an entry point for some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin II is a metal enzyme that contains zinc and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 has an M2-terminal peptide domain, and a carboxylic-terminal cholic chain is a carrier of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a single-pass membrane protein type 1, which has active enzyme receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular portion of the ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme called chidase, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then out through the urine.
ACE-2 is found in most organs of the body: it binds to the cellular membrane of alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, in intestinal cells of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
ACE2-specific messenger RNA is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a balancer of the ACE.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin 1 hormone into angiotensin 2 acetic.
In contrast, ACE2 separates the carboxylic end containing the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valine-tyrosine-histidine-proline-vinylalanine) and analyzes it, converting it to angiotensin (1-7), histidine-aspartine-valine-valine-tyrosine.
The ACE2 is separated into a number of other peptides including [des-arginine9]-pradriquinin, aplin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and gerlin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19, and has a role in Hartnip disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the binding of the S1 spike protein to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the enzymatic domain of the ACE-2 transducer on the cell surface leads to cellular veneration and the transfer of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles that are located in the cells.
This insertion process needs to initialize the S protein by a transmembrane protease enzyme, host serine2, whose inhibitor is still being tested as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia was reduced among those treated with ACE inhibitors, who were more at risk of pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
"The use of ACE inhibitors has led to a reduction in pneumonia deaths, although the results have been less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human angiotensin-2-converting enzyme (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for acute lung injury, as it has been found to improve pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute dyspnea syndrome induced by fatty polysaccharides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin II enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while it begins to work after 30 minutes, and continues to be effective (period of time) up to 24 hours.
There is ample evidence to suggest that recombinant angiotensin II may be a promising treatment for those with traditional angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) and in diseases with elevated blood angiotensin II. Clinical trials are under evaluation on the effect of recombinant angiotensin II infusions on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices specifically designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which means the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed to design applications to track contacts.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less invasive alternatives to privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they might integrate a functionality that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has published an app that allows citizens to check if they have come into contact with people with COVID-19.
It is an app used by people in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, people use an app called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has designed the app, releasing it as an open-source app to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology in collaboration with the Ministry of Health has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting adoption from Apple's Google Play Store and App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking app was in the advanced development phase, and could be available for distribution within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the Blue Trace protocol.Russia plans to roll out an app that uses the geographic virtual surroundings of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow and is designed to make sure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has cited a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and a potential lack of effectiveness if applications are used only by a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful Coronavirus applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add Coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, limiting this to only “official” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of Coronavirus applications, particularly with regard to whether or not the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Surveillance should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Monitoring and surveillance extensions should include provisions for determining when to stop them;
The data should be used only for the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and established on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties in law should be specified;
Protections against abuse and protection of citizens' rights should be in place to address abuses;
“Effective engagement” is required from all “relevant stakeholders,” including public health experts and marginalized groups. Germany’s Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter ohne Greenzen (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from device operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to sites’ raw data have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preservation systems have been created that use centralized servers for interface-only communications (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracings.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this data to send SMS notifications to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available as well, which it has allowed due to widespread changes to information privacy laws following the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.Countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details on this have yet to be released.
Tracking privacy contacts is an applied and successful concept and is supported by robust research literature dating back to at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked to come up with privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth Low Power (PLE) to record a user’s proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEP-BT was a coordination effort containing both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-maintaining decentralized approach tracking (DPBT/DP3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and contact tracing mechanisms.
In these protocols, the personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matches occur on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab was working on the development of SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or intersecting paths and making use of them to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on research from the report “The Evil Face of Apps: Preserving Personal Privacy in the Context of the Epidemic” released in March 2020. Enigma MPC’s SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that also originated in MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Numbers Tracking Coalition was founded by groups focused on what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature to achieve widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced a call-tracking initiative, claiming that they would maintain privacy based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth and privacy-maintained encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three stages:
Tools to enable governments to create official, privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking apps
Integrate this functionality directly into Android and iOS, as Google and Apple plan to resolve usage and ongoing monitoring issues by first distributing systems through operating system updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as re-use, re-assignment, change of purpose or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is the redefinition of the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than it was originally designed to treat.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently using to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and transplasma transfer.The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which contains multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides the plausible plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins targeted for SARS-CoV-2 are door-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S-proteins, and ADP ribophosphates.
Hussein A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that were then improved and analyzed for their structure similarity to higher-similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chlorocaine is a malaria treatment drug that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of chloroquine hydroxysulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment by the FDA clinical trial process has not been approved and is licensed under an emergency use license only as an experimental treatment for emergency use to treat hospitalized patients who cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC has announced that it has not yet determined "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention, treatment, dosing, or period of SARS-CoV-2 infection".
Doctors said they use the drug when "there's no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University Langone School of Medicine is experimenting with the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Faviperavir was "manifestly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given faviperavir and the other half received omiphenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has warned people that existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Abe has held preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the drug.The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases as the virus has already doubled.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study that used lupinavir/retonavir (Calitra), a combination of the antivirals lupinavir and retonavir, stated that the results "did not detect any benefit".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to reach a compound associated with SARS-CoV-2.The scientific community is seeing a case of criticism about resources being directed at repurposing drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lupinavir/Ritunavir to the international solidarity experience.
Gilead Sciences developed remdesifer as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesifer has an antiviral activity in vitro against several nematode viruses, mucous viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is developing resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdesifer may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for those with moderate disease, and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 disease, as well as two controlled trials of placebo (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

A Phase II trial is currently being conducted using a form of ACE2 on 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute hospitalizations in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcurona, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms without needing to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Many anticoagulants are also being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is now widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study in Italy of 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium inoxaparin in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with past outbreaks such as the March virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend using ribavirin to treat COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese Directive
Omifenovir: specialists recommended the use of Omifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese directives
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified as potentially reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tosilizumab (interleukin 6 receptor): approved by China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. See Tussilizumab-Covid-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a supposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no clinical trials have been completed, many attempts are underway to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes it, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five candidate vaccines in the first phase of safety studies in April.
Covid-19 was recognized in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform that has progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (deoxygenated RNA and RNA) (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, adenovirus carrier type 5)
According to scientists from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in April, there are 115 total candidates for vaccines in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (presumably at the planning stage or being designed).
Phase I and II trials conduct initial safety and immunoassay testing, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, with more precise and effective dosages.
Phase III trials typically involve a larger number of participants, including a reference group, and a test of the vaccine's effectiveness to prevent the disease, while monitoring the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular synapse vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, led by Haneke Schwetmaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with her biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer with the novel antigen vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and had begun testing.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had started a vaccine project to synthesize the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for pre-clinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even with accelerated action it would take at least one and a half to almost two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it was developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is undergoing laboratory research, with plans to be tested in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "significant sums of money" for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to co-develop a vaccine based on the messenger RNA.
The candidate RNA-based vaccine BNT162 is currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would receive preclinical test results in April 2020 and could begin its final candidate vaccine tests in humans by the fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for COVID-19 vaccine research involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, pushing the total investment of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Partners of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for COVID-19 Vaccine Development are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing in animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-inflicted RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on COVID-19 medical countermeasures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, the potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "S1 subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 given with microscopic needles elicited strong responses to antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] were evident starting from 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a candidate vaccine based on DNA as a possible nasal spray.
Using phages, DNA will be designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are fighting.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific animal models of COVID-19, such as mice genetically modified with ACE-2, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or preventative vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine for MERS.
When March spread, it was thought that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against the March-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) vaccine (based on DNA) had completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were in development, all of which were virus-targeted vaccines, two adenovirus-targeted vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GameVac), and one MVA-targeted vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have sparked a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases show mild symptoms, some develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April, more than 2.24 million people were reported infected in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly between people during mixing, often by splashing when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When sprayed during exhalation, it usually falls to the ground or surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People may also get infected when they come into contact with a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most common in the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is an instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase (RT-PCR) reaction through a nasal pharynx.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of HIV infection and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the general public’s use of masks vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, others suggesting otherwise, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest area, a disorder, difficulty waking up, or a bluish face or lips.
In less common cases, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered from only chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
It's called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission has not yet been fully identified; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may be contributing to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases showed no symptoms while hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily tally on April 1; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms when tested.
Sputum and saliva may carry significant proportions of the virus.
Speaking out loud results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth could lead to a spray splashing up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted via biomechanical aerosols, and testing of samples from air collectors located in the lobby outside individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and the virus is then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through stool, this risk is thought to be limited.The virus is more contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease can spread, one person can infect two to three other people overall. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to persist for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper (99%).
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective provided they are used correctly; soap dissolves the virus-protective fatty membrane and shuts it down, as well as ridding the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of testing the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the Wuhan acute respiratory disease group.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the two organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus is introduced into host cells by the angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE2, which is most abundant in alveolar type II cells found in the lung.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (volved molecule) to communicate with ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China suffered from severe heart attacks and were more common in critical cases.
Rates of cardiovascular-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
Strokes (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in patients in the COVID-19 intensive care unit may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies of individuals who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammatory leaching containing lymphocytes within the lung.
Despite SARS-CoV-2's orientation towards ACE2-expressing epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the T-cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in single cells that secrete inflammatory interleukin-6 and progressive lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic aspiration was also reported at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several test protocols for the disease.
The instantaneous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually performed using respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have isolated a strain of the coronavirus and spread the genetic sequence so laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) are under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy ranged from only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines from Wuhan University's Zhongnan Hospital proposed methods for detecting infection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Multi-lobed double-sided stained glass opacities with an asymmetrical, peripheral and posterior spread are common features at the onset of injury.
Sublateral spread and form of stone collocation (thickness of the lobular septum with an uneven alveolar filling) may appear and merge with the progression of the disease.
Little data is available on microinfestations and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from autopsies:
Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, emphysema and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pulmonary cells, large, non-typical alveolar cells, intramuscular inflammation with lymphatic leaching and formation of giant polynuclear cells
Acute pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar secretions.
Diffuse alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular thrombosis (DIC); white blood cell reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using the inside of the elbow if a tissue is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any cough or sneeze.
CDC has recommended the use of fabric face coverings in public places, in part to reduce asymptomatic transmission.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Spacing guidelines also include people being at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. As no vaccine is expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as "curve flattening".
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not only available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity arises in these two compositions of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand-cleansing substance".
Add glycerol as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
Personal hygiene and reliance on a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the infection. The World Health Organization and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for those hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensive care and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from a variety of bodies into a free resource, the book Critical Care Online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment is available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some specialist doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in an air-borne infection isolation room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne disease precautions.
Recommended tools: PPE aprons, a respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Breathing devices (rather than face masks) are preferred when available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for purposes other than specified.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protection or home-made masks as the last resort.
Most COVID-19 cases are not so severe as to require artificial respiration or replacements, but some cases do.
The type of respiratory support provided to people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided using a high-flow nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether or not either of these options is of the same benefit to those with a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gaseous ventilator when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds relative to the population, restricting the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of serious cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required ventilatory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of those hospitalized for COVID-19 are eventually admitted to intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complicated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators should have high pressure and positive exhalation modes to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and pneumothorax-associated lung injury.
High positive expiratory pressure may not be available in older breathing devices.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedies seem to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended volunteers to participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously or directly threatened.
Has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The application is able to detect 'contacts' using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected and intermixed people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile phone data of those presumed to be infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantines and protect those likely to come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with Germany’s federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy’s regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said mobile phone companies told him that “40 percent of people are still moving everywhere”.
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend in which more than 42,000 people participated.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kersti Kaljulaid, also made a global call to showcase innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may feel distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of injury itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic stagnation is a major storm that is harming people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a mild course with minor symptoms or be asymptomatic, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data for COVID-19.
COVID-19 in those most affected may develop rapidly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of people with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with a blood clot abnormality, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% had kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 showed elevated levels of liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death for those transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and the overall incidence was six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the men's mortality rate was 2.8% while the women's mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological anatomical examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromexide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathological changes have been observed in alveolar cells.
Lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of those hospitalized had previous medical conditions.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary as a result of those differences between regions, but also because of methodological difficulties.
An undercounting of simple cases may lead to an overestimation of mortality.
However, the fact that previous cases cause deaths may suggest that the current mortality rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care and to die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has revealed a 20 to 30 percent reduction in lung capacity in some survivors of the disease, and lung tests have indicated damage.
It may also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether or not the previous infection confers effective and long-term immunity.
Immunodeficiency is seen as a possibility, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it has been announced that there have been cases that have recovered from COVID-19 and later contracted it again.
These conditions are thought to worsen if the infection persists rather than reoccurs.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, due to the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely the result of human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 is the first date of onset of symptoms.
Official WHO publications report that 8 December 2019 is the first date of onset of symptoms.
Numerous measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are influenced by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time taken since the outbreak began and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) in its 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) designated U07.1 as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 as clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-19 deaths without laboratory-confirmed infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global fatality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other metrics include case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of those found to have died of disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of those infected (those who have been detected and those who have not) and those who have died of disease.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they follow a specific population from infection until the fate of the condition is known.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all those infected, their presence may provide information about the number of those infected.
At the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak, Castelloni di Ada, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Ganglet, the disease spread due to carnival festivals, and spread to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified as resulting from it.
Moreover, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% probably have antibodies, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the resulting death rate varies between men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women fading by only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on gender, the non-prevalence of smoking among women and the comorbidity of men with concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sex-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of contracting the virus.
The WHO announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "Covid-19".
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that Ko is an abbreviation of the word Corona, and in the abbreviation of the worm virus short for the disease and 19 indicates the year of discovery of the outbreak for the first time: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigma.
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms "Covid-19 virus" and "Covid-19 virus" in public statements.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "corona virus" and "corona virus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the names Novel Coronavirus-2019 and Acute Respiratory Disease associated with Novel Coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease according to 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names Covid-19 and Sars Cove-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare materials such as nose swabs and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and issued the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and misinformation regarding the origin, scope, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medications or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers conduct international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, WHO launched the “Solidarity Experiment” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
No vaccine is available, but various bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV are used because it is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under study.
First, researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering an immediate immune response in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the partial unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the partial units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.[citation needed] Antibody-dependent sedation has been cited as a potential challenge to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials of already approved treatments for malaria have been evaluated, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed to be reused in the treatment of the new disease make up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of potential COVID-19 vaccines and drugs has been conducted as of April 2020.Many existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remedicifer, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lupinavier/retonavier and lupinavier/tunavier combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for the efficacy of rimdesifer, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, formerly used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virus Research points out that although a dose of 1 gram is recommended, the weakening of this dose is extremely dangerous and can cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a license for emergency use of chloroquine hydroxy and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on living organisms was recommended after it was demonstrated to inhibit the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial conformation of the spike protein via transmembrane serine II (TMPRSS2) protease is necessary to enter SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties.The China National Health Commission added to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
He is undergoing non-random phase 2 testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe medical conditions.
In addition to being used in serum ferritin testing to identify cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some sufferers.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved interleukin-6 antigen receptor T-cell therapy, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-free cytokine secretion syndrome that have a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tosilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by COVID-19 immune systems to those who need them is being studied as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Neutralization of the virus represents the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can act as a defense medium against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-based cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, or both, may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
Convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased to spread faster.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently infected and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
