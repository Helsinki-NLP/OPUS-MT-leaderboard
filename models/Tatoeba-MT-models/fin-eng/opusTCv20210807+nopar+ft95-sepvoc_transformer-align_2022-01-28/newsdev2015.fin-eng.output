Changes to business support practices - Province - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national business subsidies will also be concentrated in four ely centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the Ely Centre of Southern Savo is responsible for operations in Mikkeli.
Under the new Business Support Act, which entered into force in early July, EU Structural Funds support must no longer be targeted at large companies unless it is a completely new activity.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with over five thousand inhabitants are also considered large municipalities.
Instead, EU support can continue to be granted for investments that improve the conditions for municipalities' business lives.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national subsidies will have a strength of approximately 30 people.
At least for now, they all continue to work in their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölönen, head of the Structural Funds unit of the Ely Centre in Southern Savo, is employed in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now aiming for in Ukraine
Russia is acting consistently, even if it doesn't always look like it.
Head of the National Defence College Strategy Department, Lieutenant Colonel, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukraine news Monday morning.
This has long been the same, Siren says.
Elsewhere, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
Elsewhere, Ukraine says its paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov insisted that an immediate ceasefire should be reached without conditions in the Minsk negotiations.
Russia denies being involved and immediately needs to achieve a negotiated result in order to establish their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big pattern: suddenly you have to start negotiating and specifically so that Russia gets its own grip on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair outsources cabin services to Norwegian company, lay off people
Finnair will start subcontracting cabin services from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will apply to Finnair's Hong Kong and Singapore routes in the first phase, but it is expected to be expanded later.
The outsourcing of the two routes will result in a total reduction of approximately 100 person-years in Finland, which will be implemented in the first phase with layoffs, the company said in a statement.
In addition, the work of about 80 Asian temporary workers ends when the routes are outsourced.
Finnair said in June that it plans to outsource cabin services for about 20 routes over the next two years.
Outsourcing was achieved when no agreement was reached with the staff on the savings.
Outsourcing is scheduled to begin in January-March next year.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partner candidates.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nerve-related back pain, or sciatic pain, in those who do heavy shift work.
A study by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health followed firefighters for 13 years.
The link between sleep disorders and sciatic trees is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance condition of firefighters, which are tested regularly, do not seem to protect against pain, says Sirpa Lusa, the study's director, in a press release.
Firefighters' work is irregular shift work, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey conducted in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
Easily wreak havoc on other apartments
Water damage is by no means always caused by a leaking pipe or tap, reminds an expert at the Hosting Association.
We have been contacted when the breakdown of the aquarium has caused water damage in the housing company, whether it is possible to ban aquariums," says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the Association for Hosting.
Furuhjelm points out that not only pipes and sewers are common causes of water damage, but today more and more new machines such as ice makers have also caused water leaks in homes.
Many people are unaware that machines such as a washing machine or washing machine should not be left unattended.
Also, the water tap must be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipes can lead to a water leak.
A resident may be considered to have committed negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case liability for damages lies with the resident.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the terms of the insurance and the case.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused damage by negligence, the resident is liable.
If the resident has passed out in a shower on top of the floor drain, neglect can often be proven, because usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the maintenance man comes to the apartment where a extinguished resident is found.
Furuhjelm says that due to the generalization of exhaustion on top of floor drains, many student apartments now have two floor drains installed in shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although no longer to the extent that they were more popular in the past.
Even a dog's water cup and the fall of a home wine container can become real water damage.
I also know of a case where there were many cats in the apartment who had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage," Furuhjelm says.
The principle of liability for repair always goes the same way if the company's articles of association do not provide otherwise.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of the surface material and damage to the housing company structure, as well as damage to other apartments.
Water damage easily causes damage to other apartments, because the concrete in the structure really easily absorbs water.
According to Furuhjelm, battery leaks in apartments are particularly difficult because batteries easily leak insidiously into structures.
Water damage can be caused by the now becoming more common air heat pumps that produce condensation water.
Water should lead to a solid drain or rainwater network, and not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the shareholder to remove water, snow, ice and debris from the balcony, the legal expert advises.
Furuhjelm instructs that while the housing company's rules do not require, for example, a fixed drain hose for a washing machine, there may be a condition in the insurance that the compensation is therefore not received.
It is worth being careful with your own home insurance terms.
However, I consider the loose drainage pipes in washing machines, for example, to be a major risk, which have caused many damage.
I recommend that the effluents be always solidly discharged into the sewer pipeline.
Snow and water removal on the balcony
Control of washing machine, washing machine, etc. machines, while they are on.
Closure of water taps (washing machine and dishwasher)
Cleaning the floor drain from view twice every six months.
The recommendation is to connect the effluents to the drain solidly.
Checks the taps and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting

FC Honka lost again and cast into serial jumbo
Tapiola Sports Park met the two weakest teams in the football league on Sunday night.
FC Honka, who last celebrated the win in June, hosted the Vaasan Ball Club, which sailed in a seven-game winning tube.
The VPS just took its previous win against Honka in July.
Sunday's encounter with the Espoo team came to a good seam, as the VPS returned to the winning position by 2-1 for a long time.
Before the game, Vaasan head coach Olli Huttunen complained about his team's inefficiency, but the confused Honka defense eased VPS' goal-making problems.
Gameically very nervous performance.
We couldn't get any longer attacks at all, we couldn't keep the ball," Huttunen estimates his own performance.
In the first half, Honga's top-up duo Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both of the goals of the Vaasans were created as a result of loose play of the boots.
The opening goal of the match was only seen after five minutes of play when Steven Morrissey directed the Honka goalkeeper Walter Viitala, who was jogging past Sebastian Strandvall's shot.
I'm sorry about the first half.
By the time we got there, the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game," Honga head coach Shefki Kuqi exorcised.
After the initial shock, the Espoons got their games together and rolled the ball at the attack head.
Especially midfielder Carlos Portela and winger Roni Porokara were eager to search for places to do, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly miserable.
The closest to the goal was Honga's midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot, however, left 20 metres, was slightly past the VPS goal.
VPS effectively attacked, utilizing its quick attackers and Honga's confused pair of toppers.
At half an hour, the Vaasans made a 2-0 hit when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through alone.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good head in the opening episode and repeatedly created situations on the left side.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for the Espoo defense throughout the game.
"I screamed at halftime that if you lose, you lose with honor," Kuqi said.
In the second episode, the entrenched Honka furiously applied for a narrowing paint.
The team was twice close to a hit until the third attempt was successful.
The winger Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to even out the match.
The Espoo team was taking more and more risks, which allowed VPS to counterattack dangerously.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were once sooted with Viitala, but Honka goalkeeper's snotty rejections kept the home team in the game.
Towards the end, Honka got a little tired and couldn't get any extra paints.
With the defeat, Honka cast the Veikkausliiga last, while there are still seven games left.
Putin says he can take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite harsh in a telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, according to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his irritation at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks," La Repubblica said.
Putin's message to Barroso was this: There is no point in irritating Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave an interview on Russia's first channel of television about the Ukraine crisis on Sunday night.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict to be completely internal to Ukraine and called on the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev in harsh words of firing civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "can't stand by and watch" if people are shot dead at close range," Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: Actor's work destroyed family
The heavy work of the Konkari actor and the theatre family was raised to recognize how the actor's profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns 70 next Friday, but I think he has a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to a year ago or two years or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but she still works for many men.
Sometimes it was joked that not many plays were made in this country without Esko Roine.
Currently, Roinee has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre play How to Succeed Effortlessly in Business, Tampere Workers' Theatre's Mind-Breaker and Tampere Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming film Risto Rapper.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
Roine's acting career didn't start promising.
I didn't qualify for the Tiernaboy picture at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said the reason was that I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear, there was no choice.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the field that I dropped out of school and volunteered for the army just to get into theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how you count.
If you count work like Englishmen that every part of a TV series is their own show, there are over 600 TV stuff.
I was three years in the New Day, which was done three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed there when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to Autumn 2016
Esko's older sisters Eila, 83, and Alice, 76, are in full swing and are playing wild roles as anarchist grandmothers in Tampere Workers' Theatre.
Little brother will be rocking on the stage for years to come.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about someone this age.
I always have to take a small reservation to come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
Years have also left their mark on the man.
Age does not come alone.
The knees are operated, the hip whistles and osteoarthritis trouble, but when you don't let it bother you too much, these will get your head," Esko Roine says.
For the TV audience, Roine became familiar with e.g.
Pirate radio and a quiz where he and Antti Einiö shared crops, $100 bills.
It was Antti Einiö who shared crops.
I tried to keep saying they were hundreds, not crops.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a pointless Inspector Iron Rock.
He became a favorite of the Tampere policemen, when he happened to be working for a lieutenant of the same kind.
A police officer stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, "That Iron Rock is great!"
Working group successful
The theatre work has been remembered by Roine e.g.
Producer and Master Class of Helsinki City Theatre, Death of Tampere Workers' Theatre Trade Traveler and Long Day's Journey to Night of Tampere Theatre.
Everyone has to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It is not because of me, the working group has succeeded.
Rimanals have also come.
Pekka Puupää's role in the film is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is that I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome is not satisfactory to me or the viewers.
As a line actor, you can't choose your own work.
It's just nice of you to do what you've been told.
Along with theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the 80s, he held a restaurant in Tampere called Wanhat Roomeot.
It was an educational experience.
It didn't work out at all when I tried to be the administrative director, actor and then a restaurateur of Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year it became clear that there was no way to reconcile these.
The typical thing was that when the show was about to end or in the intermission and I already had time to think about whether I would turn on the sauna, there was a call from the restaurant that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the show.
Memories for a Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roinee has memoirs, ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of lump they've made out of face-wrestling memories.
You know, when I used to play Zoom, they called me a face-wrestler.
They didn't know me by name.
The book has been made for years.
Roine once told me that there was no bombshell in store because she hasn't done anything so heavy, or if she is, she won't tell.
I made a small opening sentence to the book.
I say in it that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading here.
There is a lot of professional stuff there, both as an actor and as a theatre director.
The publisher says there's also a buzz about the hilarious theatre school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but I did do all the tricks that looked like a kid.
It wasn't as wild as it was in the time of Turkey.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got from there than the confidence that once school's been done I'll know it's not up to you if the actions don't get better.
I didn't have to think about how good I would have been if I had gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen and was able to work with them.
There were legends from my first father-in-law, Kaarlo Halttunen.
With Pia Hattara, we had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I got to know him during school.
The middle son of the fire, Martti, was in the same class with me.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
As a painful thing, he recalls his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to the mother and the son to me.
I didn't think it was a good solution, and I think the kids are pretty much agreeing as adults now.
In theatre circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In my case, some part was that I worked a lot even then.
I was in the theater for almost every case.
Then there was the TV and the radio on top of it.
I worked a long day and family life suffered.
On the holiday, maybe a night off
Esko Roine celebrates at Tampere Workers' Theatre with a Mind-Above on September 7.
The celebration will continue at Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
The mind-wrenching is also buzzing there.
I was 50 at work and 60 at work.
When such an easy-to-move play happened, I thought we would have 70s now, so we can get them off with one bang.
According to Roine, there are no ceremonies on the actual birthday.
I think it's free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have booked some job for that day.
Or it's a strange night off that I'm going to have on the night off," Roine says.
Aviation companies concerned about production chain
Some of the UK's smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain are enjoying the unexpectedly large number of aircraft and engine development plans currently being implemented simultaneously.
Aviation and Defence
While some enjoy the order sum, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems and price pressure at hand in the production chain.
"It is quite true that price pressure exists, especially now that production volume poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, president of MB Aerospace, one of the main suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, which represents about 240 suppliers of aircraft production in the north-west of England, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans respond to these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need more investment in the new production equipment and machines needed to implement these production volumes," Gallagher says.
Some companies say that the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft building are part of the problem.
Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, who produces gas turbine wings, said the company had a "challenging time" behind it when several new construction plans began to be implemented simultaneously at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very low production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were not paid for until afterwards, and we also had to try to get ahead.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Several operators in the sector believe that more investment and coordination between small suppliers will be needed if the UK wants to maintain its position as the second largest player in the aviation industry after the United States.
Geoff Ford, president of Ford Aerospace and fine mechanics engineer from Tyneside, says the order sum should increase producers' confidence and desire to expand and increase production capacity, as work will be enough.
"If this doesn't happen, we'll lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
A few major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a company that manufactures aircraft and engine parts under the FTSE 250 index, acquired UPECA, which manufactures parts for the aircraft in Malaysia, for £75 million.
MB Aerospace acquired companies in North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new operations, but in reality the most production is slowed down by the limited design and the number of engineers," says Gallagher MB of Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted to them from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain operators are exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aircraft manufacturing unit, who is also the chairman of ADS, a UK aircraft trade entity, believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There is pressure in the supply chain, but I would not describe the situation as critical.
"More important than dumping is the introduction of new technology and advanced processes," Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from the mistakes and are now more cautious so that the number of buildings is not increased too quickly.
As Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it got into great trouble when the company made a loss and factories and production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, head of Rolls Royce's aircraft manufacturing unit, says the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to manufacture the jet aircraft engine.
"The road will certainly be bumpy, but we believe we have done more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to increase operations," Wood says.
Boeing CEO James McNerney said the company's production chain had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have acted openly towards journalists, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus' passenger jet manufacturing unit, says the company will do everything possible to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase production of the A350 to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
"Maybe one of the journalists won't succeed, and our job is to try to prevent this situation as well as support suppliers and look for alternatives, but there are waiting for big problems," Brégier says.
Bregiér says Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the editor.
So this is my work and Airbus's."
Hong Kong protest groups begin 'age of civil disobedience' with Beijing banning open elections
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
Activists supporting democracy spread out on the streets of Hong Kong after China rejects its demands for open elections.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups stress that demonstrations can flare up and swear to ensure that an "age of civil disobedience" begins in the city to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese government in the elections.
Thousands of protesters defied the rain coming in ruckus against Hong Kong's shimmering horizon as they wandered into a demonstration organised by the democracy-friendly Occupy Central Group in front of the law enforcement council's facilities on Sunday night, where protesters urged people to participate in a large sitting demonstration to paralyze the city's financial block.
The demonstration took place just hours after Beijing announced that it would deny voters the right to publicly propose candidates in the 2017 mayor's election, thus defying months of protests that will further increase the city's division.
The protesters will take part in the beginning of the Occupy Central demonstration in front of Hong Kong's key government buildings.
"We want a fair and decent election," says 24-year-old website administrator Dion Tse, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-yi.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kongers.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kongers.
China's highest legislative body, the Chinese People's Congress, approved plans for election changes, allowing only two to three candidates to participate in Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the nomination requires the approval of a 1200-person nomination committee, and opposition politicians believe that this will effectively prevent the author of divergent political views from accessing electoral tickets.
The protesters participate in a demonstration held in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
Police estimate that more than 2,600 people were currently involved in the demonstration.
A large number of police officers followed as some 100 protesters led by the Scholarism student group gathered late Sunday at Grand Hyatt, where Communist Party member Li Fein was to stay in Beijing after arriving.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism, and Federation of Students, among others.
Or, however, to comply with the law, did not say the exact date on which road blocking will be carried out, but urged participants to closely monitor the development of the situation in the "next couple of weeks", adding that the city will officially enter the "age of civil disobedience".
Benny Or answer questions from the press.
"Look at the person next to you," he said at a Sunday demonstration standing in front of a billboard of two disobedience figures in China.
That person will take the center with you!
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old convener representing Scholarism, said earlier that preparations for protests by high school students are ongoing and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending the "international demands" of universal suffrage is a "lost of time" and comes from some Hong Kong politicians who seek to "mix society and mislead it".
"An impractical proposals such as the public nomination have wasted a lot of time," Li says, demanding that the electoral style be created in such a way as to fit the real situation and legislative framework of each society.
A law on universal suffrage can only be passed if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-member legislature, support it, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong may be drawn into a protracted political debate if the reform proposal is vetoed.
"It would hinder business and the development of the city," he says.
Nearly 800,000 people voted in an informal survey organised by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose China's demands, and according to the demands, the candidate needs approval from the committee.
Up to 172,000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the March of 17 August, which supports Beijing and opposes the Occupy Central movement, attracted about 88,000 participants. Estimates of the figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although police and organizers' estimates differ considerably from these figures.
Three injured by lightning strike at New York beach
In a lightning attack on a New York beach, three people were injured.
The fire department said the men were injured on Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx, on Sunday night as severe storms crossed the area.
The injured men are hospitalized.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
Lightning struck when severe thunderstorms swept over the city.
Storm rains, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on East River Island.
Dozens of commercial flights arriving at the city airports were delayed due to bad weather.
A new idea is not to please
This is the latest help for employees and managers of network users, and is shared by Harvey Schachter, author of Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is to recognize such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If not, the idea is probably popular and self-evident — that is, boring and mundane — or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
While a historian, Harvard's Drew Gilpin never repeated anything he had already published so people wouldn't think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the rector of the university, he repeats the same thing several times to get the message across widely.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman thinks TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people are reading news online does not mean that the internet is good between advertising — just like the first phone was a popular means of communication but a bad option for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that one word is enough to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they would solve the problem as a collaboration, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not informed of the collaboration at the beginning.
If the task is to find a recurring pattern or relationship between two units, performance expert Dave Paradi advises you to forget about Microsoft's SmartArt and instead use Diagrammer.com, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital cataract surgery banned due to safety risk
The specialist has been temporarily suspended, and the UK national health system NHS stopped directing patients to cataract surgery at that private hospital after problems with the hospital arose.
Two people applied to Torbay Hospital for emergency room after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
Torbay Hospital in Devon has said it was in contact with 19 patients treated on July 26 and invited them to a "urgent clinical trial".
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized and said that the matter had begun to be investigated after the doctor was expelled.
The matter came to Torbay Hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart sought first aid for eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, all of whom were examined on the same day, have needed a repair operation.
Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not directed patients to treatment on Mount Stuart since the problems arose.
David Sinclair, interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation leading Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem in its early stages and were able to contact all relevant patients quickly.
Whenever we guide patients to treatment with a service provider, we conduct quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its permit issues are in order.
According to Gill Gant, director of patient safety at the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District, "patient safety is always the absolute number one priority, so it is important that these cataract surgeries are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe."
Ramsay Health Care UK, which manages Mount Stuart Hospital, apologized "sincerely to all patients who experienced complications."
The company was announced that "as soon as we learned of a potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital were called to all the patients in question."
This specialist has had a treatment permit for Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 cataract surgeries in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgeries he has performed have been excellent, with a percentage of complications of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily suspended until the matter has been investigated.
What is "4chan"?
Infamous anonymous messaging site first published leaked nude photos of celebrities
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the hacker's first option when he posted stolen images?
"4chan" was founded in 2003 and is a conversational messaging site that is barked at as much as praised.
The site is divided into several sections, so-called bulletin boards, where anonymous users can discuss everything possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create one, constantly used profile, and their publications are not retained.
On the most popular bulletin boards, comments may disappear in less than a minute as newer publications supersede them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere in the "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known memes on the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of site rules has also led to the site having a lot of questionable or downright criminal content.
The most popular bulletin board on the site is /b/, which is intended for miscellaneous conversations and regularly displays NSFW (Not Safe For Work).
This may include domestic porn, but also raw and shocking images. An anonymous hacker posted stolen photos of celebrities specifically on this bulletin board this weekend.
American CytRx invests in research and development of anticancer drugs
The goal of CytRx is to cure cancer — or at least slow it down.
Los Angeles-based biological medicine company, which recently was the target of a controversy over the sale of shares, specializes in the research and development of anticancer drugs.
The most promising drug is aldoxorubicin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts clinical trials treating soft tissue sarcoma with aldoxorubicin, Kapos sarcoma associated with AIDS, and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumors.
It is like a controlled missile that is transported directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx, an anticancer drug from aldoxorubicin.
Aldoxorubicin contains so-called connecting technology that works like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to protein in the blood, which also accumulates in tumors, allowing the drug to be transported directly to cancer cells.
The compound only donates the drug in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to be given more and more doses of anticancer.
"It's like a missile that's transported directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on drug development, CytRx makes no profit.
The company sold shares this year, thus raising $86 million to maintain operations and research.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for alternative treatment for soft tissue sarcoma in a crucial 3-stage clinical trial.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and adipose tissue.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when the original treatment does not lead to results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to seek permission for the drug from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman says.
The drug could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data from a previous clinical trial of CytRx in December showed that aldoxorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
"For a long time, the question was "we haven't seen clinical data on how much it differs from the drug itself," says Andrew Fein, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion of many that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial because it is significantly different from the previous study, which yielded good results.
"Many things have to go right," he says.
Fein compares the development of medicines to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money is invested to find that one gold vein, and the investment continues until that gold vein is found," he says.
Money is spent on research and development for so long that the drug is successfully commercialized.
Several shareholders have called for CytRx to be tried because they felt it gave a better picture of its success than reality.
The lawsuits accuse the company of hiring a DreamTeam Group that manages investment relationships, which allegedly hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotechnology company for articles published on pages like Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the lawsuits, the articles did not reveal that the companies paid fees to the authors.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed articles "which were contrary to practice".
Several articles on the company were also removed from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to the lawsuits.
"I don't have the time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
He said the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented employees who tend to find employment in biotech centers such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
Analyst magazine's views
The price of CytRx shares rose to $8.08 on January 10 and then fell to less than $3 in April when allegations of advertising shares came to light.
According to Analyst magazine, actions and negative publicity have fallen below the price of shares than their actual value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure there's any easy way to bypass this issue as long as the perception is valid."
In the name of the law, the cameraman in the police series was killed in the middle of filming
The photographer of the Law in Name series, which is based on real events and is also presented in Finland, died Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting.
The cameraman filmed a shooting between a police patrol in Omaha and a person suspected of armed robbery at a fast food restaurant when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly from the injuries he suffered.
Police reported that a person suspected of armed robbery died in the shooting in addition to the cameraman.
One of the first reality TV shows in the Name of the Law series has been shown in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been shown on MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of an outsider will play a crucial role in the appeal court hearing that began today.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa Court of Appeal is now dealing with the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court restored it to the District Court with new evidence.
The purpose of the Court of Appeal is for the sentence to be delivered this year.
Auer was released by the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011.
At that time, the court considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, Attorney General Kalle Kulmala gave the prosecutor's view of the night of the murder and the facts that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
We think the crucial question is whether an outside factor has entered the house that has killed Jukka Lahti in the way and time that Anneli Auer told us.
It is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's story," Kulmala said.
The homicide began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and file for divorce.
At some point, we moved to the kitchen where Lahti held on to Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One took a kitchen knife," Kulmala described Monday the events of the night of the killing.
The prosecutor said several factors prove that there was no external factor present.
For example, there are no sounds from an outsider from an emergency call recording.
Auer's eldest child, the daughter, told me during the interrogation that he saw the perpetrator when the man left the door of the fireplace room.
The release of the Vaasa Court of Appeal in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's account.
Prosecutors say daughter's sighting cannot be true
"The daughter did not see an outsider in the parents' bedroom, even though she visited it twice," Kulmala said.
The prosecutor's new witness is related to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has reported on the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
The woman said the daughter only told the hospital that she only saw Lahti's body when she visited the murder site in the fireplace room.
Auer's defense plans to present the court with lines of investigation, the role of which the police have not sufficiently clarified, according to the defense.
When the Vaasa Court of Appeal acquitted Auer three years ago, the court considered a foreign man's DNA found in halo to be one of the references to an outsider.
The sample later proved to be DNA by a researcher working in a central crime police laboratory.
At that time, a DNA sample of 700 people was taken as mass sampling.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigative lines were excluded," said defence attorney Juha Manner.
One of the new witnesses to the defense is about a possible outsider.
A Ulvilian woman told police about a porillaise who, according to the woman, had confessed to the act.
Police questioned the man in the summer.
The prosecution made the decision that the Poriism had nothing to do with the homicide.
The prosecutor made a request for an investigation into the woman, as the prosecutor suspects the woman had lied in her report.
One of the new witnesses to the defense is a nurse who worked at Satakunta Central Hospital the night of the killing.
The Satakunta District Court sentenced Auer to life in prison for murder last December.
According to the district court's ruling, the possibility of an outsider is fought by, among other things, the stories of Auer's children, the sounds referring to an outsider are missing from the emergency centre recording, and the time required for the events to run.
The verdict came by a vote of 2-1.
A minority judge wrote that in a criminal case, conflicting evidence must be interpreted in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter's account must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions in the story, she had found an outsider leaving the door of the fireplace room.
Auer's two oldest children have been called to be heard by the Court of Appeal.
The daughter was first heard personally last year in the Satakunta District Court.
When he was heard in court, he could no longer remember the events of the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child named his mother a killer in a video interrogation in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the night of the murder behind a closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
As the plaintiff, the boy is not obliged to say anything in the Court of Appeal.
The court hearing will continue today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
Auer's hearing will continue tomorrow if necessary.
Anneli Auer is currently serving more than seven years in prison for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin's participation in the G20 be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the number one enemy.
Putin is scheduled to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is fiercely discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The punkrock activist group Pussy Riot called on Australia over the weekend to ban Putin's participation in the summit, which will involve more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most influential countries.
"We do not think this person has anything to do with the G20," Maria Alyokhina told the public at Sydney's packed opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that it is on the verge of a "perfect war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia", or "new Russia". So is it necessary for us to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said he will "weigh the decision."
Mike Callaghan, director of the G20 unit at the Lowy Institute, said Australians could not decide who will attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Australia may decide who it will allow to enter the country, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just as with New York hosting UN meetings or Washington hosting International Monetary Fund meetings, "it is not the host's job to forbid someone invited to come," Callaghan says.
The previous week, Tony Abbott said he "weighed the decision" after Russia's disapproving actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
As Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on the matter alone.
"However, this is an important issue that I will weigh a lot about, and I believe that other countries will do so in the coming weeks as well," he says.
People attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The event will last two days and will involve a wide range of representatives from the world's largest and fastest developing economies, with a total population of about two-thirds of the world's people, accounting for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few separately invited guests from countries outside the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
Callaghan said Australia was given a questionable task of balancing between different interests under great public pressure.
He believes that the Prime Minister's best way to deal with this is to take advantage of the opportunity to put pressure on Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to take this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand that President Putin make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to report on his actions," Callaghan says.
Clearly, there is an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world expects them to bring these things up.
pro-Russian rebels are preparing weapons for an attack on Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk Airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and Callaghan says this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This is certainly the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly states that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
Opposition leader Bill Shorten is "very reserved" for Putin's arrival in Australia, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Minister and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other states and G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines crash, and in the absence of pity, responsibility and proper cooperation in the event of a plane crash, fully and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are swarming on the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians are very wary of welcoming Putin to Australia.
German business world criticizes 'self-sufficient' Berlin
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become "too confident" and "self-sufficient", as government policy threatens the country's hard-to-reach competitiveness.
Criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government coincides with the signs of a slowdown in Europe's largest economy, which is a source of concern as to whether it will be able to run economic growth in a stagnant euro area.
Criticism of business leaders is the result of political decisions fiercely opposed by the German business sector, including the introduction of a minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-serving workers to 63 years.
"I think the biggest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-sufficiency," says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world's largest chemical manufacturer, based on sales figures.
The EU economy
He thinks, "In general, there is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to spend and unemployment at a relatively low level. So what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but instead focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
Markus Kerber, CEO of the German industrial organization BDI, said: "The situation in Germany is now good.
However, over the next ten years, every developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce (DIHK) has also expressed criticism for recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and even once, slowed consumption is on the rise again.
However, GDP, which fell in the second quarter, has highlighted the vulnerability of export-winning Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2% in the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make quantitative stimulus more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "transfer from public consumption back to public investment", for example by focusing future consumption increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
Kerber believes that Merkel's government will destroy the fruits of her social democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s with strict policies.
Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Businesses, said: "The situation in Germany remains good compared to other countries.
It is thanks to the companies and not so much to the government policy. . . .
An example from neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social assistance and restricting freedom to manage a company is the wrong way to do things.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more bluntly, saying that recent government decisions are a "disaster".
Germany threatens to lose everything it has worked so hard for, only to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment," the banker says.
Bock said the energy reforms of the new coalition of governments failed to solve the fundamental weaknesses of policy that have caused industry costs that undermine competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher at the music festival after security has blocked access to a fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach country music festival in Indio, California, where he reportedly got into a fight with a strict security guard.
Ashton Kutcher reportedly got into a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
A Kutcher fan tried to approach him backstage at the Stagecoach country music festival in California, after which the situation got out of hand, TMZ reports.
Kutcher was in VIP facilities when a young woman approached him to greet and shake hands with him.
When the Star of the Male Half series went to greet the fan, the overzealous security guard intervened and caused the melee.
The actor and security guard drifted into a handcuff, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to hold back Kutcher, TMZ says.
After leaving his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher dates Mila Kunis, who, like Kutcher, is one of the stars of the former '70s show.
Nujakka occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones was virtually removed from the regular cast of the hit series after he released a video calling the series "junk" and urging fans not to watch it.

Angus T. Jones, "Jake", calls the series "junk" and urges people not to look.
Baltic bacteria kill holidaymaker
A bacterium based in a popular German tourist destination from the Caribbean has made six people sick.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other regions of the world, but it is most found in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacterial is most effectively spread in more than 20 degrees in brackish waters.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right," Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS), told The Local.
Bacterial can be found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
LAGuS said the sufferer had been on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He died in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks now, and it is possible that his leg must be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshop with a small wound on his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after finding on the way home that his leg has turned blue.
Doctors noted blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus on the foot.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known of the danger," Sonja Bruehl, the wife of the sick person, told Ostsee Zeitung.
A serious illness and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and his family could have been avoided if information had been better available, for example, a holiday destination could have prepared a bulletin on the matter.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors have been advised to follow the infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official announcement was given.
Cool temperatures have caused the risk of bacterial disease to be lower.
"The test results of [Monday] showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly," Dr. Will says.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the bacterium that causes cholera, is particularly dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response, such as in HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men are at higher risk of developing the disease than women because estrogen has been found to protect against the pathogen.
If the bacterium gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
After the bacteria have been wounded, the probability of dying from the disease is about 25%.
V. vulnificus can also be contracted by eating seafood it pollutes, although Dr. Will says that in these cases it is not about this mode of infection.
Pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus last caused poisoning in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: Breast removed due to cancer suspicion
The 80-year-old singer Vieno Kekkonen is gigging and exercising hard, but has also had to fear for her health.
It is incredible that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is already 80 years old.
He is also amazed at how there can suddenly be so many of those years.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
80 years sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
Vieno Kekkonen spends her birthday with her family.
In late August, he had a birthday party by the Folk Music and Pensioners' Association in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place where my grandfather was born.
I was overwhelmed by the celebration, the birthday hero tells of an occasion where a stage sized for three hundred was full of congratulators to the brim.
A few days later, Muhos gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following at a young age.
And now we're both this age!
Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
During his long career, there are few aspects that Vieno Kekkonen has not seen in public.
There is one thing he has never publicly stated before: in 2006, a second breast was removed from him.
There was an unclear finding on my chest at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
It was not cancer in the end, which I was happy about.
A new breast was performed in the same operation, so it was a pretty big procedure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own chest in a way in vain, as the information about the unclear discovery would have been heavy to bear, and it cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vieno Kekkonen says and points out that for younger people, losing their own chest is certainly harder.

Farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressing in level.
The voices of experts have been drowned in politically purposeful opinions.
Helsingin Sanomat and Yle in particular have been harping on the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea during the summer.
Rapid action to curb emissions has been called for in the same breath.
The average farmer, with the help of a few environmental scientists and their help, seems to be a superior nutrient expert compared to the well-informed suppliers.
The farmer knows that nutrient leaching cannot come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients has been sown in the field as is harvested from there with the crop.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilizers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting of the nutrient balance.
Authorities monitor compliance with the terms.
Nutrients stored in the field have also been washed into water bodies after fertilization restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions here for years as well.
Farmers have the desire and readiness to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that it is impossible to reach zero.
"If we want to have an amount of agricultural production roughly equal to consumption, we just have to accept that this is the case," says Jyrki Aakkula, MTT's Director of Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
The past summer brought extensive blue-green algae deposits to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were quite unanimous that algae gained its growth power from the marine's own phosphorus reserves.
Phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly potatoes from the agriculture of the coastal states of the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The wastewater treatment of growing cities on the shores of the Baltic Sea was rampant until the late 20th century.
The problem also concerned the wastewater in Greater Helsinki and was not seen as a problem except for the uncleanness of one's own beaches.
Beach pollution was prevented by building a wastewater pipe in the open sea in the 1980s.
The quality of the water directed there has certainly improved over the years.
The nutrients that once ended up in the sea will not leave it, even if the agriculture is completely stopped in Finland.
Yet every summer the blue-green algae debate and the accusations made are always directed at today's agriculture.
Public debate marks the farmer as guilty of the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult as it is used to carry out political passions.
The Greens, under the leadership of their chairman, Minister of the Environment Ville Niinistö, are pushing for major changes in agri-environmental standards.
As a springboard, Niinistö has used the summer algae discussion.
In harsh words, Niinistö has accused MTK of its old-fashioned nature and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a limit to political rhetoric.
Most specific water protection projects are based specifically on cooperation between MTK, farmers and environmental management.
Niinistö's offensive genre serves more fishing for urban green sounds than water protection.
I think that's the point.
With good words, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, MTK's mission is to ensure the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has put forward is cuts in other agricultural money.
Repeal of mining tax does not pass: Palmer
Abbott's government's latest attempt to throw a mining tax into the trash looks doomed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party also fears that the government has included a rule in the new initiative that could limit employers' increases in compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in the House of Commons on Monday to rush through the process of repeal in a state of general confusion and in the face of clear indignation by the Labour Party.
It set aside the original repeal initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes to, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described as being primarily related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, it was an initiative to reverse the "failed" mining tax, as well as other decisions such as a low-income pension contribution ($3.6 billion in savings), a earned income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and a bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP), did not approve of the government's transfer.
"The poorly planned initiative to abolish mining tax will not be accepted in the Senate without a low-income pension contribution, a earned income support bonus, and a bonus for school-age children," he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Shadow Finance Minister Chris Bowen accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory guarantee amount for pension contributions, giving the Finance Minister all decision-making power.
"This is unprecedented," he told reporters in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other increases, with the 12% target for the Labour Party's pension contributions guarantee amount moving up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will of course resist by all means," Bowen says.
The bail is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Finance Minister the power to decide on stopping future increases.
Man's body found on Brighton beach
Sussex police searched for the body of an unidentified man before the high tide of two in the afternoon, and police closed an area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist attraction.
Police and coroner are working to determine under what circumstances the body was placed on the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Investigators go through a list of missing persons to determine if missing persons are connected to the body.
Police were not yet able to confirm whether the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
Mexican police say one death by accidental explosion at the border
According to Piedras Negras police, apparently an accidental explosion in a customs building on the Mexican-American border caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other people.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas is the operational director of the local police in the city on the Texas border.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in the Sunday explosion suffered skull damage and five others suffered burns.
Lopez Arenas said the explosion occurred in the morning at the customs officials' overnight facilities.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border guard.
Three Atlantic City casinos close in September
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month
Male customer plays at Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., July 29, 2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City as three casinos hand out their last cards on the table
Three casinos will close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-light metropolis, known for its cash machine kilin, can no longer count on game revenue.
More than 5,000 employees will be unemployed as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press news agency said.
There will be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its light.
The expected closure of three casinos, one of which had only been in operation for two years, is the city's latest disaster after the Atlantic Club center story ended just eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the city's casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed," the New York Times wrote.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, an AP news agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has gained many more competitors as casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania chip much of Atlantic City's once-huge casino earnings.
Even Massachusetts, which has previously opposed gambling, is looking at its own share of the amount of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule difficult to accept
According to Teollisuuden Voima (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by plant supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's third reactor will not be commercially operational until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, Director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that the construction work is already largely complete and the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information obtained from Areva.
Silvennoinen states in a press release that TVO welcomes any initiative to speed up the project.
Areva today submitted TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3 to complete the construction of the third reactor in mid-2016 and commercial operations could begin in 2018.
According to Areva's press release, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the approval of the reactor's automation systems, which was received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluoto 3 was originally scheduled to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about which one is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is being held in the arbitral tribunal, where Areva has claimed compensation of as much as €2.7 billion from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's demands to be unfounded and requires the company to provide approximately EUR 1.8 billion.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm within the 24th International Water Week, urging energy and water actors to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time, ensuring adequate water and energy production for an ever-increasing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed to pump, store, transport and clean water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute that organised Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water actors is urgently needed to find solutions that will enable all the peoples of the world to flourish.
This year's Water Week Water Prize winner Professor John Briscoe described water as a potential basis for growth, needed by both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that "developing countries face major challenges.
They must mobilize these funds.
Briscoe added that "[there is no permanent solution to the water crisis] anywhere."
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a circle.
Representatives will discuss the ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water actors during the week during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, at a ceremony at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday, September 4.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make decisions that make sense for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home in Miami: Cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, a ferry carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell, and 14 people were reported dead.
The same thing has happened to hundreds before, and this was certainly not the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1,000 Central American immigrants die trying to illegally cross the U.S. border.
The first city is ready to die.
Ironically, however, when they arrive in the first city in the country, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place to stay: either a haven, an effort board up, or a place to spend time while waiting for a better occasion.
Few people imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return to their homeland.
The cities favoured by immigrants are home to a disproportionately large number of people born abroad and temporarily staying in the country, and in them death and return to their home country are constantly working.
An estimated 20% of the bodies of those who died in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, a short form of professional slang words human remains) are flown home from Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to Pierson, the industry's largest company, CEO, about 80% of this traffic travels abroad. The company flies bodies to several destinations in Central and South America as well as several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there as well.
Even after death, returning home has its cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the human remains flown back by the airline to its home country in 2013.
Returning bodies to their home country is not cheap: prices can range from five to 100 to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and general health requirements for flying and supplying human remains also vary.
Migrant communities in immigrant-favored cities sometimes organize funeral communities to help with costs, because the restoration of bodies is expensive, the government does not help in the process, and the dead are often young people without insurance.
A few credit institutions and informal health insurance programs have once emerged from such communities as the Italians, Jews, and Greeks who lived in New York City —the first immigrant groups in the United States.
New generations of Mexican, Chinese, Filipino and Bangladeshi immigrants are now doing the same in several of their preferred cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few people who move abroad plan to make the immigrant city their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, foreigners who died without a will are subject to Sharia law, even if the laws governing the inheritance of the deceased homeland are different.
The entire property of the deceased is frozen and then distributed in accordance with the Sharia court's decision.
Aer Lingus, the human-residue network of the airline Aer Lingus, which is central to Dublin (
2013), the scope reflects the multicultural demographics of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The idea of death is rarely present as a person passes through or lives through a city popular with immigrants.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to an immigrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant's way of looking at life, not death.
However, death in an immigrant city abroad means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for the immigrant — decisions about whether you want to be part of a local or global community, the universe or the earth, short-term or eternal.
The Centre Party and the Left Alliance are making an interim issue of inequality
Opposition parties the centre and the left-wing alliance plan to ask the government an intermediate question about the livelihoods of low-income people and the growth of inequality.
The parties want to stimulate debate about people's income problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
Growing inequality is also visible between different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties point out in a statement.
In the government budget next year, cuts and tax increases will target low-income people, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary working people, while food, medicines and housing, among other things, will continue to rise.
In reality, nearly half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in a statement.
The income problems of the working people have also worsened.
The parliamentary groups of the Centre Party and the Left Alliance will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the Finns Party, has already announced that it will leave an interim question about police and internal security resources.
The Parliament's autumn session begins tomorrow Tuesday.
New York City West Indian Day parade to begin soon
Caribbean culture is once again in the spotlight in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there politicians also see each other and are seen.
The annual parade will be held Monday in Brooklyn.
It exudes the celebrations of traditional pre-fast carnivals, and part of it are dancers carrying complex, often feathered outfits.
Brooklyn president Eric Adams is this year's festival champion, but there are also many other political faces to be expected.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and candidate politicians to greet the audience a week before the primary elections.
Despite the celebrations, the parade weekend has also included violence in previous years.
Police have said they will try to keep the event safe through additional measures, including monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Is it even worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, right?
That question is not worth answering.
This metaphor, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but which hints in the direction of a particular answer, tastes both high-flying speeches and a more mundane exchange of words.
The opening words of Ciceron's famous Catilina accusation are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, are you going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same goes for the questions my wife has asked me, "Why shouldn't I warm up a chicken five days old to the kids?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference theme is a finer word for a rhetorical question.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the public is persuaded to accept the question.
The insidious rhetorical question suggests that no sane person could agree on that.
David Williams, author of the 19th-century subject writing guide, described the rhetorical question as "one of the words addressed admirably designed to produce a strong sense of truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they present is the impossibility of disagreeing."
The Art of Bending
Rhetorical questions can be asked in a row if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several rhetorical questions asked in succession, designed to express sadness or indignation, are called epiplexes.
Job, for example, uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What do you gain from oppressing me -- ?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see the same way a person sees it?
There are also chains of rhetorical questions in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
In addition, there is also a so-called hypophora, which is what it is about when you ask a question and answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is a sex monster for all women?
Parru!
True Moses!
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
More examples from my wife: "What is the only food the children have eaten and where could they have become sick?"
This chicken.
What idiot fed it to them?
You.
Curiously, the rhetorical question does not usually seek to persuade, although rhetoric means the art of persuasion.
If you are trying to talk someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been converted or getting angry about someone's stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful when trying to reconcile opinions than when trying to get one to accept one's own opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim "And it's not nice when it's so sunny outside?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of what ties the speaker and the audience better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no dissenting opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached rather than consensus, the speaker can seem, well, smug.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weak point of argumentation.
In the headlines of the magazines, the rhetorical question is all too often clearly the strongest possible argument in a very weak case: "Did aliens build pyramids?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
"Are you thinking what we are?" was a risky campaign slogan by the British Conservative Party in the general election in 2005.
The party lost.
For some, finding such cases has become a hobby, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, raised by British journalist John Rentoul, are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition looking for the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?", sung by pop star Gary Glitter before she was revealed to be a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written a book entitled "You Talkin' to Me?"
Investigator: Federal compromise time may be over
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal government could be some sort of compromise on the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that getting peace in eastern Ukraine requires discussions about the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of those living in the East.
Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is, according to the island, a priority in a certain way over Russia's goals.
Ukraine certainly rightly suspects that Russia would thus seek to influence Ukraine's domestic policy, he says.
If no federal solution is reached, another option could be some kind of frozen conflict from a Russian perspective, where Russia would practically control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari estimates.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has denied the allegations, although pro-Russian rebels, for example, have themselves reported that their forces have fought "loose, voluntary Russian soldiers".
Up's leader: Katainen planned an influential mission
Tiilikainen reminds that the job description is new and still taking shape.
He said the idea was that Katainen would somehow coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment issues.
One of the Commission's priorities for the new period's programme is, of course, the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, financial expertise and role during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to be well placed within the Commission.
It is planned that the task would be portfolio-free, i.e. Katainen would not have its own Directorate-General under his authority.
Instead, Katainen would become a team leader in the area of EU competitiveness and employment, allowing him to have other portfolios related to the sector to be coordinated in addition to the portfolio of the Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Soldiers' Mothers organization, up to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and there are currently over 7,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
Human rights organizations say at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital of the city of Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is crowded with wounded in the war in Ukraine.
The mothers of the soldiers collect their information from the families of the soldiers.
NATO has estimated that there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte on his alcohol consumption: "There's going to be a story after a little drink"
Big brother Jussi and Andte drifted into thinking about the life of the BB house on Monday night.
Jussi, on the basement side, pedaled the exercise bike with Andte, one of the Manor's residents, chatting on Monday night.
The two wondered what their actions looked like to the viewers of the program.
Not until he's seen it, Andte said.
Jussi thinks that most of the time at the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Any celebrations or tasks make up only a fraction of the life of the BB house.
More like waiting and wondering and talking and living.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the manor spent the evening on wet signs on Wednesday and alcohol, in particular, got Andte talking on top.
Jussi asked Andte if the party had made a man's life in the house more meaningful now that he had been able to talk to other residents about them in a little bit.
A little drink to take, and then there's going to be a story, Andte admitted.
Watch Andte's interview on ISTV's video!
Anna Abreu reveals her body ideal in Me Women
Anna Abreu says in Me Women magazine that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she was on a gig break.
Anna, tired of gigging at the time, thought that dieting would provide more energy.
Fred Montana / Splash News
A couple of years ago, Anna dreamed of a body like Victoria's Secret models.
My body ideal was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good and thought I wanted to lose weight," Anna told the paper.
Anna, who presents her trained body with gigs and music videos, says she is not a lust trainer, even though she has been named one.
Viena Kytöjoki
Anna, in Timm's condition, trains at the gym and engages in boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but that I can lift a certain amount of weight in the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to feast.
If I feast, I really feast.
Sometimes I pull unhealthy overs and I don't wonder if there were more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'm disgusted if I do something bad to my body.

Anna says she likes her body.
Corporate profit distribution pleases shareholders but does not increase growth
Are Australian listed company executives today only trying to please a large number by agreeing to shareholders' wishes for a greater distribution of profits and buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to shareholders served by the Board of Directors?
Profit distribution is the most important thing, it was revealed last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buyback programs and by distributing more profit have risen clearly.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the other side of the coin is that capital consumption is decreasing faster than analysts have predicted. This fact causes many to ask whether there is too much emphasis on short-term popularity and whether there is enough focus on growth in the near future and long term.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
More funding is being raised, for example, in the cheap stock market.
From the company's point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Even if the funds raised from the loan market are not taken into account, it is clear that generosity towards shareholders is primarily financed by the fact that the company spends less money on investing.
The net profit of this wave of purchase programs (and the cancellation of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital in the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period a "capital decrease period" during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares small.
As part of the same plan, companies have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programs was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected non-realised capital raising programs was $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to regard capital consumption as a curse word in one of the headlines in its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, informal evidence has been around for months.
Glenn Stevens, the head of the Central Bank of Australia, found it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "battle spirit" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, because slow consumption of capital usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that "reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have fallen by an average of 4% in the previous two years.
Estimates of the amount of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems good from the perspective of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of proof of corporate obedience.
If I got a coin every time the CEO has said that the price of a stock for a short time is not important, I would be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
Of course, this claim is not true.
CEOs follow the prices of shares very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short- and long-term bonus packages of CEOs are defined by the value of the shares, and the position of the directors depends on it.
CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are acquisitions, increased investment in an organization, or profit distribution) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for a medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to the investment market.
Therefore, the current gust of conservatism seems to be agreeing to short-term goals.
Those who estimate cheap stock markets and are in favour of saving capital do not have this concern, but it was all too clear in the reporting period that the weight was on reducing future capital consumption, and the most sparing companies were praised.
Large mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto held number one in reducing capital consumption, but many other companies also did the same — some of the compulsion and some because they feared the shareholders' reaction.
Why do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse strategist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as profits from other, more traditional fixed-profit investment products have decreased as unexpectedly central banks have lowered interest rates worldwide to bring more money to market.
This is how investors are forced into capital markets to look for profits, and they in turn put pressure on companies to share more profit.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain profit distribution.
Investors would rather have the money right away as more and more investors approach retirement age.
Statistics from the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution was largely affected by corporate cost cuts and not by revenue growth.
Cases of leaking celebrity nude photos look like a data spy or breaking into an email account
According to Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos to the internet amazes information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female public figures in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of the people described have reported that their images are fake while others have said it was a long time ago deleted images.
There are a lot of people filmed and it has been said that Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead are among them.
After hacking, the biggest question is how the attack was made.
Were the photos and videos genuine and where were they downloaded from?
The most featured source for images in the news — an shameless and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service — is the most unlikely option.
Large companies like Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house, which are tasked with trying to infiltrate the company's own systems on a regular basis.
"A large-scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
The original publisher also does not claim that the claim is true," points out Rik Ferguson, vice president of the Trend Micro Information Security Research Unit.
A simpler and more likely explanation for hacking these public figures (as well as hackings for less famous people every day) is the leaking of an email address and password, either by guessing or by fishing for information, i.e. by tricking a person into logging in with their information on a genuine-looking site, after which this information is used against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhones to save settings and, above all, to backup images when transferred to a cloud server.
The user's account can be logged in to iCloud by entering this email address and password, after which their photos and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has enabled two factor authentication, i.e. additional protection against intrusion into the account, in which case the owner's mobile phone will be sent a code before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few people use the 2FA feature, either because it is unknown or because it is considered arduous.
Apple is still investigating whether all the data comes from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely the users' accounts were invaded.
The Company has not made a statement at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgot Password" link on Apple's iCloud service by first collecting public figures' email addresses from an address book for another hacked device, for example.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password for multiple services, in which case passwords were hijacked through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's photos claims that the images are genuine, but does not say when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking attempt.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this required creepy effort.
I sympathize with everyone else who was hacked," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from a modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in the cloud because they often have no room for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple's iPhone standard setting is saving images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows phones store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox provide automatic image and data storage service.
"People take and delete photos, but they don't understand that images are being uploaded from an account," Cluley told The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees, "Deleted doesn't always mean deleted," he says.
Pictures and videos can be kept for years.
If someone has access to the user's email address and password, they can redownload all the photos and videos that have been sent by email.
Images from Apple can be uploaded to a Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot allegedly representing videos and images taken from Windows PC that have not been released so far.
Two-step authentication protects against such hacking because it requires anyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to enter the code sent to the original user's device, usually a mobile phone.
Without code, access to the account is blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo offer two-step authentication to the account, but it is not yet known whether those public figures used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they are claimed to be in are not genuine.
A spokesman for Ariana Grande has said that the images that Grande is claimed to be in are "completely fake".
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: "I think the nude pictures taken are WRONG, don't you understand.
Let me cut the roots of the rumors right from the start
Cluley brings up another option.
Since the hack was targeted by public figures, someone who managed their social media accounts or regularly handled their email may have broken into their accounts.
"I would like to know if the actors' agents or some representative have a part to play," he ponders.
However, these public figures do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of a security attack victim or helped configure it, and secretly changed the system so that all data can be recovered.
This was the case in the case of Christopher Chaney of Florida, who was nicknamed "Hollywood hacker", where the hacker distributed images from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to ten years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly invading email accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera, in the name of this stylist, for pictures of the star in low dress, and then posted the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions "were sure to be one of the worst privacy violations you can imagine."
Chaney was also claimed to have been spying on two people online for over ten years.
According to Cluley, "in the case of Chaney, the star email accounts were hacked and changed so that someone sent their data forward even after the password was changed."
Cluley says that the obsessive action of hackers breaking into these accounts "remembers the gathering of butterflies."
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had come across a list of information and login information for these accounts in services such as Dropbox.
Hackers may also have tried to penetrate for a long time
or they had access to information from some email account, such as an address book, and then fished for information from other people.
I don't think it would be a simple iCloud security gap.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped in Syria by terrorists associated with al-Qaeda.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to keep 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, a terrorist group that captured a crossing site in the Golan Heights last week and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday and there is no information about their whereabouts.
In Samoa, ministers attending the UN Small Emerging Island Conference, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon at the summit and has offered Australia's help to save the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN in everything it can, providing assistance to the intelligence service," he told AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We maintain very close contact with all the intelligence network partners and friends -- to ensure we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabola that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, a Filipino peacekeeping group held captive in its army barracks was reported to have escaped in various parts of the same disputed area.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan Heights since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
Cheaters try to steal your money through a coal tax repeal initiative, Australian Competition Authority ACCC warns
Cheaters are taking advantage of the coal tax repeal initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The SCAMwatch unit of the competition authority has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on offers that sound too good for government agencies, offering thousands of dollars in credit.
Cheaters may use figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save on buying commodities after the carbon tax is overturned and offering him up to $7,000, the warning says.
Scammers may sound very convincing because they have figured out the victim's personal information, which they take advantage of in an attempt to get their hands on bank details or in an attempt to get the victim to pay a fee.
They discuss current topics to trick the victim.
Scammers use more than just a carbon tax scam to get to grips with money, their stories are even more advanced, and they take advantage of current issues to build a scam around them.
The plane missing on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and Robin Williams' death have also inspired fraudsters.
ACCC instructs you to contact the company using self-explained contact information instead of the contact information provided by the caller if there is the slightest doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the cancellation of a carbon tax, be on your guard.
If you believe you have been scammed and provided personal information or transferred money to a scammer's account, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true — for example, free money distributed by the government — it probably is.
Economic messages: Lipponen blames EU sanctions on Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the EU's sanctions on Russia in an interview with economic messages.
Russia's focus in politics is to pursue its own interests.
This is not necessarily effective," Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started work as a business liquidator for the Finnish Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) in the Arctic.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that Northern Dimension environmental projects with clear prospects go ice," Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding now hinders cooperation, which Lipponen says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that Finnish companies' interest in cooperation projects in the Arctic Ocean region will continue to be as great as before.
He is currently conducting a study for EK on Finland's Arctic policy and the opportunities for companies in the north.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks far ahead, we talk about decades," he says.
It is rare for the seal to come in shallow water or near the settlement, says nature pedagogue Vesa Heinonen from the lecture centre of the Ostrobothnian Museum.
A seal was seen in Suvilahti, Vaasa, today on Sunday swimming near the beach.
According to Heinonen, the seal has probably come to Suvilahti after food.
It's not a mess.
This means there are fish in the area, Heinonen hints.
He says that the Sundom Bridge, for example, features a ringed seal, especially in spring and autumn, which arrive specifically after the fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa sea area.
The liver country sees the seal on the villas' fronts, he continues.
Norppia lives in the Bothnian Sea and the Archipelago Sea, among other things.
South Australian court says murdered pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga behaved aggressively and violently outside the nightclub
Murdered South Australian pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga.
The court hearing has revealed that pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive towards both his partner and security guard for only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers of the accused of killing Vallelonga asked in the lower court of Adelaide to release their client on bail because it was "clearly" self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case was not serious enough to keep her client, whose identity has not been published, locked up until the trial.
"According to the evidence, the dead person behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
Then began the melee, which resulted in the 40-year-old drunk man -- tearing the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that the prosecutor said that the death was caused by one stroke, which clearly suggests self-defense or defending another.
The 25-year-old man is not charged with manslaughter for the time being.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St and Synagogue Place around 2:25 a.m. on May 4th, with severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries at Adelaide Royal Hospital early the next day, and friends and pizzeria customers were left to mourn One Tree Hill's "local legend".
Prosecutors said there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had told the taxi driver he had "put someone to sleep for a few days."
However, the video footage from the security camera is now proving something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and got his share of hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client's side has both the assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
Prosecutors opposed the release of the man because only one of the three security guards present on the night of the crash had interfered with Vallelonga's behavior.
They said the other security guards did not consider him threatening because "he was short", and he used the big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that a taxi driver who saw the incident clearly would also prove that Vallelonga was hit "strongly" and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - justified as a tradition - Foreign News - Ilta-Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to postpone the start of widely frowned hunting around the world.
The Japanese city of Taiji resumed its annual dolphin hunting season on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
There is a lot of opposition from the yacht that has been met around the world, including the British newspaper Guardian.
In the yacht, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay herd where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected to be transported to dolphinariums and theme parks around the world.
Dolphin meat also ends up as food.
However, local authorities said the start of hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
Knowledge of the practice spread to the world with the 2009 documentary The Cove on the subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, the hunt has been criticized not only by animal conservationists but also by diplomats.
Opponents argue that dolphin meat has a limited market in any case due to its high mercury content.
According to those who defend hunting, including the Japanese government, it is a tradition.
Defenders have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin hunt was already opposed over the weekend by demonstrations in several countries.
Protesters in Tokyo say the hunt is damaging Japan's reputation around the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some NATO member states insecure about deploying new troops in Eastern Europe
Within NATO, views are divided on whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the Ukraine crisis, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military alliance to bring permanent troops to their countries, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective on Russian politics, and it threatens to bring down European security," Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
NATO member states are meeting in the beginning of the week, and the military alliance is due to announce its new contingency plan.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the TAE Agreement on Conventional Weapons, signed in 1990.
In it, NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed how they will deploy armed forces in the Atlantic-Ural Mountains region.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself froze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually withdraw from the agreement.
Due to the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO is considering whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"NATO's resources must exist in all NATO countries that need resources," Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the British Parliament's Security Committee, told the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller the youngest person to fly around the world
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
Guthmiller, 19, just became the youngest person to fly around the world — and even alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young person in South Dakota State flew 30,000 miles, stopping 23 times in 15 different countries on five continents.
On his way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star due to his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "Some spoiled, rich puppy just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun".
Guthmiller had little to say to the authors of such comments.
Of course I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that with my record I will also inspire other people to go out into the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's flight enthusiasm began at a young age, first he asked his parents to eat in the airport cafes.
Later, he insisted on taking flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20-paying, 20-minute introduction, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm would stop there.
Didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon after made a deal with his parents to give him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of getting my own car.
In a trade, I could fly planes.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a pilot's license and two years later leased a single-plane Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT College handled the maintenance of the aircraft himself and made the fuel calculations.
Many hours above also meant that he himself needed additional refueling —
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookie sticks completely during a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both wonderful and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries had no weather radar to help him navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds only reached a little above the plane and which of them reached 45,000 feet and tore the aircraft apart.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The amount of fuel on the plane would not have been higher.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the hardest part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he feels that the takeoff phase is technically challenging due to the large amount of fuel needed for the 16-hour flight.
Despite the risks and even the horror of the high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for computer training through Code.org.
He is a coder himself, and founded his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
It would be great to start the next Apple, but let's see how it goes.
Guthmiller is going to aim high anyway.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchisee is harder than you might think
Lori Joyce was excited as fans lined up in her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores across Canada after Canada's W TV channel began showing The Cupcake Girls reality TV show in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one franchisee was not suitable for the task.
"My franchisee sat in his car and called me to say that 100 potential customers line up outside the store ready to buy a cupcake and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes, as it was a huge missed opportunity for us.
After what happened, Joyce decided to change the process of choosing franchise partners from the start to emphasize the management skills that correspond to the company's culture rather than baking skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has held about a hundred interviews for each of the 11 franchise movements.
We start with six weeks of training, but the employees work in a completely different way in the working environment itself, so the whole process is quite difficult. That is why the training we have emphasizes above all the suitability for the corporate culture.
Finding the right franchisee is vital to the development of any small business.
A strong and honest manager is able to shape and grow the organization, while a poorly suited manager can cause costly damage to the company.
"Before I thought looking for a franchisee was like going on a date, but that's not true at all, there's a lot you can do to get to know someone before getting married," Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a franchise partner, a firm contract is signed, a security deposit is obtained and a new store is built.
Starting a partnership with someone before seeing how a person works is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise parties is similar to a strong marriage, as they share common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that a franchisee should also be careful when choosing a future franchisee before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same idea as relationships: if a date is rude already on a date, imagine what he is like in marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and evaluate the future contractual partner, as well as to pay attention to even the smallest alarm signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchisees like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those who are franchisees must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
New franchisees, on the other hand, must conclude, on the basis of a supposedly successful parent company, what challenges they have had to face and what skills the new franchisee needs when faced with similar difficulties.
Companies that are first franchisees can also ask for the help of a franchise advisor to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time, there is a lot of help available to those who are franchisees and entrepreneurs on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process becomes easier later because franchisees learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchisee can give advice and help with the assessment.
"The first franchise partner's contribution helped Brian (founder and CEO of Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) significantly as he created the company and franchise system," says Erik Church, Chief Operating Officer of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he could not have created alone, so the first franchisee must choose this idea in mind.
Under Church, there are 216 franchisee representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a franchise partner of You Move Me, Toronto.
Chruch's method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
"One of the confidence tests we use is to ask yourself, 'Would I invite this person to me for a weekend barbecue?'" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend much of your workday looking for solutions to big business challenges with them."
Church further points out that O2E Brands is largely a thank you to its franchise structure for its success.
In a business organization, managers often see their own position as short-term and relationship to a lower level of management as very official, while franchise entrepreneurs enter into a partnership with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"There are many more advantages to the Frenchise partnership compared to the traditional corporate structure, but the partnership is also much more intense," he says.
It is a partnership, not a relationship between a vice-president and a local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but when well managed it produces better results.
Railway delays lower grain prices in northern United States
Delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in grain prices in the northern central United States, weeks before a huge crop is expected to put the transport network under new pressure.
Commercial grain silos in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 a bushel - about a dollar less than control prices - primarily because of the cost of securing the capacity of incoming train rails, traders and agricultural organizations say.
IN Raw materials
The problems are most acute on Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway BNSF railways and Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a hearing on service problems on Thursday.
In the northern plains, railways must be used to transport agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in train transport increased as the 2013 heavy harvest was followed by a very cold winter, which caused the trains to slow down and shorten.
Some farmers believe that increased crude oil transport from the North Dakota Bakken oil shale formation has replaced grain transport, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to the head of an international grain trading company, the cost of grain-storing and transferring sellers to ensure the use of the train has risen from zero to as much as $2,000 to $3,000 a year.
Someone has to pay the expenses.
"These costs will be borne by either the farmer or the customer," the head of the grain trading company says.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that North Dakota's soybean harvest will grow by more than a third and spring grain harvest by 16%.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we are trying to start a new crop clean, meaning that enough storage space has been drained for the crop and the grain has been sold and moved.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of the trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's crop smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President for the Transport of Agricultural Products at BNSF, said the company has reduced the sum of prolonged transport (traincars ordered by customers, which have been delivered more than four days) from a peak in early April, 16,500, to about two thousand.
"We've moved almost everything from the old crop we were supposed to move," Miller says, referring to the grain left over from the previous crop.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF grain trains were nine percent lower than in the second quarter of last year, a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that the development is "uneven" but pointed out that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of transportable products, such as grain congestion spikes.
Due to the second sum, the Canadian Pacific railway company's trains with problems are 11% lower compared to the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much low speeds of the early part of the year.
Canadian Pacific has told the Railway Control (Surface Transportation Board) that changes to its train wagon ordering system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 15-20% over the coming harvest season.
"The action plan, which extends to the autumn of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, focuses on continuous improvement of train speed and efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more train cars every week," said a spokesman for the railway company.
Ukraine crisis may solve NATO 'identity crisis'
Leaders, diplomats and experts from major countries have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the end of NATO's mission in Afghanistan also means an end to NATO's importance itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO summit in Cardiff, Wales this week, with 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
There is no shortage of world crises on the policy list of politicians and diplomats, even to the extent that the exit of Afghan forces, which used to be a priority, is no longer the most important thing.
Instead, a 28-state alliance is needed after Russia re-intrudes into Ukraine, a shocking reminder that threatening Europe's independence may not be just part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defense spending and re-engage in defence cooperation.
NATO has to thank Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was somehow looking for its purpose -- and it was experiencing a fairly significant identity crisis," said Heather Conley, director of the European program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new role to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy to defeat the rapidly gaining Islamist State militants in Iraq and Syria.
Officials say the president will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-torn partners to a military response, especially one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to defeat extremist Islamists, after stating directly that "we have no strategy."
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved when discussing Ukraine or the Islamist State.
Additional economic sanctions are planned as the main remedy for the event called the Ukraine Russia attack.
European Union officials discussed the matter over the weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
US officials pointed out that the states Obama hopes for main partners in the Islamist problem are not necessarily members of NATO.
The accumulation of problems could not be foreseen two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, then-leader Robert M. Gates spoke in his last position to say that the organization has almost reached the point of "common military insignificance".
U.S. officials were constantly complaining that other states were unable to meet their funding targets.
NATO members promise to spend 2% of their GDP on defence spending, but only four Member States — Estonia, Greece, Great Britain and the United States — achieved this goal last year.
But now White House officials say they have noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff promising to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
Details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time the company has a genuine desire as member states discover any threats in their actual size.
After Russia invaded Ukraine, the union's "defence promises are more significant and important than at any time since the end of the Cold War," says Charles Kupchan, Director General of the United States National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus among the 28 Member States.
Obama spends much of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation for Russia's concerned neighbours.
The President begins his three-day journey with a day-long visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he meets with leaders from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan, to be published this week, is introduced.
The plan aims to reduce the time NATO needs to react to attacks in border states, officials say.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation signs.
The changes pose a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of kindness to Russia.
Officials say the new plan does not really violate the treaty, but it can also be a purely semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want his name on the public eye during the discussions before the official announcement.
NATO's presence will likely be described as long-term, not permanent," the diplomat said.
Putin has an effective "winter" - does he use it for Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has one ace up his sleeve for Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
As the situation in Ukraine has tightened, the West is planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a trump card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authority, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), Geysar Gurbanov, who appears at Harvard University, writes, according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the country's conflict, Ukrainians freeze in their homes as the gas supply from Russia stops.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will help Putin win the war eventually.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on July 16 due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt due on gas was already $5.3 billion (about €4 billion) by August 1.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one is thinking about it anymore, except Russia," Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to resolve the issue.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
To replenish the stocks, the necessary repairs must be made and preparations must be made for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not back down in front of the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, a Japanese holding company from Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks about humanitarian interference and planning a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will intensify in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless Kiev will pay the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Jatsenjuk said Russia was planning to stop gas supplies to EU countries in winter.
Later, Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said the speeches were false.
He said Russia will do everything possible to deliver gas to EU countries.
Liberal Saudi blogger sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes
A Saudi court has upheld a ten-year prison sentence for Raif Badaw, who founded the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement, in May.
The sentence includes an additional penalty of 1,000 lashes and a fine of one million rials (about 200,000 euros).
The verdict was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that demeans Islam.
The verdict was reported to AFP on Monday by Suad al-Shamari, co-founder of the organization.
Badawi himself has been in custody since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes in July 2013, but the sentence was appealed and referred back to trial.
The verdict was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures' Riku Rantala childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one revolutionary human encounter"
Madventures today published a new book, The World Explanation - The Adventurer's Explanation for Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala for an explanation of the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells of the most significant human encounter of his life.
Author, journalist, Madventures' other party Riku Rantala is a busy man.
A new book has been published today, yesterday was a movie picnic at Kansalaistori and on Wednesday begins the second season of Docventures.
Since morning, he's been running from one place to another.
From Mary's morning TV to take the child to kindergarten and from there to a weekly meeting.
A face-to-face interview must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, there won't be time.
In the midst of all the rush he and Madventures' second half, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write the World Explanation book, which is, according to the book's cover text, an adventurer's manual for everything.
Everything, huh?
Wow, pretty much promised.
The book discusses several themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than another, why we are here, and who we really are.
We used interviews we have done over the years.
The book has both professors and artists as experts.
We actively worked on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've been yawning a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the central message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and big questions are worth considering, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book idis is to be a good travel reading, but it is also intended to get people at home to talk and share ideas.
The conversation can even lead to action, Riku says.

One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We concluded that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the Earth, we are forced to believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The Earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First it should admit that we have a problem, only then can a change occur, Riku philosophizes.
Riku says that some studies show that Western humanity has reached the climax of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, wealth has not increased our happiness.
This suggests that when there is enough money and our basic needs are met, we are happy.
Money does not add to happiness.
We want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
Utilizing our natural resources will not be enough for much longer than this, Riku says.
You also reflect on the differences in cultures in your book.
How is an Indian person different from a Finn?
People don't differ much.
Of course, the starting points for education, health care and hygiene are different.
The biggest difference culturally is that the importance of the community is much bigger in India, for good or for bad.
When the West is prosperous, people live more alone.
Isolated from others and may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we found a suitable balance between community and being alone, we would be pretty close to luck," Riku says.
Riku has met a lot of different people around the world.
What human encounter has been best imprinted on his mind?
It's my childhood, when I was with my family on my first bigger trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there working for the UN.
I was seven years old and two of my smaller siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku is paving the way.
We came home to Finland with a big moving car.
We drove in war-torn Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the side of the road.
A girl my age walked on the road carrying her little brother in her arms.
I sat on the bench of a big Mercedes with a coke cap in my hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of that age will realize the situation.
It was one revolutionary human encounter that I will always remember.

Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Riku "went to the cabbage" that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or do not have the same conditions for life as we do.
Riku realized at the time that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of adulthood to the surface, people encountered in New Guinea surface.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to their advantage in everything, not using much money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
Survival is really hard.
It made me think.
And to think about it, he wants to have his new book readers with Tunna.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, watch and listen to more.
That it would make people act from warm-hearted lovemaking to conversation or even a fistfight, Riku throws.
This is reported by Kauhajoki magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived at the station by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi started, a man in the yard threw an object after the taxi.
The driver got out of the car, as did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the male passenger life-threateningly in the head and hand and left the scene.
The stabber is a 170-175 centimeter-long stocky, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young, blond ponytailed woman near the scene.
They hope he contacts the police.
Police are also asking for clues from all those who may have made observations of events or people involved in the case.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday, August 27, at 7:50 p.m.
"Hi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first "telepathic" message passed through the internet
The science journal PLoS ONE has published an article that says that the international team of researchers has been the first to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system were "hola" and "ciao", i.e. in Spanish and Italian "moi".
In the test arrangement, the electric brain curve of the sender test person was monitored.
The sender was trained using the program to send bits either by hand or foot by thinking about movement.
The imagination of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and moving the hands to number one.
This bit-coded information was sent through the internet to the recipient person.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to observe a flash of light for each bit coded as number one.
The recipient was taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Scientists admit that this is still a field of research in their children's shoes, but believe that computer-aided telepathic communication will be routine for humanity in the near future.
Sanctions - Punkti - Rural Future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States to not react when Russia is at war in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, the action is followed by a reaction, countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only bite in the long run.
Iran was not able to yield to negotiations on its nuclear program until after years.
The South African racial oppression government sat in place for decades, although trade was banned by UN decisions.
Sanctions have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, no top electronics or military technology were allowed to be exported to the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has set barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time the wood was frozen was the raw wood trade.
It is clear that sanctions will not bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU is going to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to stop importing cheese or exporting vodka.
The most harmful thing comes from the restrictions on the financial sector.
They will only be effective in the future.
The Russian state cannot operate in the international loan market.
It has to shorten old loans, but it is difficult to take on a new one.
Although Russia has huge foreign exchange reserves, they cannot last forever either.
Russian companies' access to credit is waning and money is rising.
Own banks are unable to finance everyone.
More money needs to be printed or there will be payment difficulties for businesses.
Bankruptcies are bankrupt in Russia too, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis persists for years, modernization in Russia will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsingin Sanomat.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would return once again to Russia and curl up inward.
An exceptional free wrestling event was held in North Korea
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international free wrestling matches in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki of Japan, who became a lawyer free wrestler, took part in the event, which was organized by Antonio Inoki of Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free wrestling matches, local athletes' taekwondo matches were also seen.
According to Inok, the aim of the event was to bring the contentious states closer together through sport and to promote world peace.
Politicians hoped for an improvement in North Korea-Japan relations.
Japan lifted sanctions it had imposed on North Korea in the summer as a result of Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation into these cases.
North Korea last saw international free wrestling in 1995.
SOK will reduce the number of people in the consumer goods trade organization by about 110.
The negotiations began in June, when the reduction was estimated at a maximum of 130.
The company says that overlapping operations have now been dismantled from its organization and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK says it is seeking clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different industries.
In addition to the economic recession and the decline in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade, which has shaken the trade in consumer goods in particular.
The result of S Group's consumer goods trade has been at a loss for some time.
The joint negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK's operating and grocery trade, i.e. a total of approximately 530 people.
Turun Sanomat: Some self-care drugs behind the counter
According to the newspaper, there are more drugs coming between prescription drugs and medicines that you can get from the shelf yourself, but only after advising a pharmacy employee.
According to the Finnish Pharmacy Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be subject to advice.
After an interview with a pharmacist or pharmacist and when predefined criteria are met, the drug would be available behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Association of Pharmacy at Turun Sanomat.
There are already a few medicines available in Finland without a prescription, but requiring advice.
One such is an emergency contraceptive.
Corruption for more specific reasons
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the low number of bribery cases and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice working group will consider whether the Criminal Code would require sections on the trading and abuse of influence.
The differences in legislation emerged, for example, in the trial of Patria's bribery case in the Slovenian branch in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
Tradeing influence brought a two-year prison sentence to the former Prime Minister in Slovenia, but Finnish law does not know the corresponding crime title.
The cooperation network against corruption has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to a recent survey, bribery is not studied much in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now commissioned a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police University of Applied Sciences on the susceptibility to corruption in various fields.
Messi suffers from groin injury - Sports - Karjalainen
Argentine national football team captain Lionel Messi will miss Wednesday's national match against Germany.
Messi keeps the stands on the side of the groin injury, told his club Barcelona on Monday.
Barcelona sees Messi as a precaution.
Messi injured a groin in a Sunday league game against Villareal.
Barcelona won the match 1-0.
Messi also missed a charity match in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he will get replacements for Asian Champions League battle in Korea
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned from playing in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players into the Asian Champions League witch boiler in the FC Seoul match.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, which also includes two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi so that the team can prepare for the first semi-final match on September 17.
Due to excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole skip Korean travel, but Coach Popovic believes in their tutors.
"Of course this is a loss — they've been three very important players at ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
After all, it's a setback, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in, he's probably worked hard, and I have complete confidence in the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovic, who will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The Socceroos team defender was injured before the season began, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in a return game at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back in his career and he's recovering well," Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes with us to Dubai, which is great news for him because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's already been practicing out a couple of times, which is good.
It'll be a while before he's perfectly fine, but he'll be fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers team has world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also believes that a trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the major changes at the end of last season.
"We know this will certainly help players create ties," Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on and off the field.

Elite burger costs three times the worker's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The economic that has been torn apart by contrasts is reported by the Financial Times.
In North Korea, the informal market is perhaps booming more than ever.
They provide wealthy or thrifty ordinary citizens with a luxury that is not used to being linked to a dictatorship state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a entertainment centre, to which a mere ticket costs up to ten months of the average worker's salary.
The place is home to hamburgers who pay $76.
That's a 3-5 month salary for the country's regular job.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korea's "Western market" originated in the 1990s, when the country suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, although the prices of supplies can be outrageous at worst.
Yet in the capital Pyongyang, many have a mobile phone with an ovh of $200.
Part of the reason may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In his day, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the country's flourishing.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council hopeful about sales
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer for Ormiston House, a building in Belfast that cost taxpayers nearly £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a 19th-century building in the eastern part of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building further, with the safety and maintenance of the building costing the Council about £400 per day.
The building was sold for about £1.25 million.
The building will apparently be used as a private residential building.
The Council purchased a building classified as Class B of historical value for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building is not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was purchased, it was put up for sale again at a price of £2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Unionist party suggested that Ormiston House might be suitable for a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the council and the real estate agent remain silent about the buyer's identity and the selling price.
Ormiston House's weekly safety and repair costs are about £3,000.
The council bought the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
Ormiston House's safety costs by the beginning of this year totalled £885,641 and maintenance costs to £371,379.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was £250,015 and the fees for development and design professionals were £212,466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's business partner William Pirrie.
Shortly after Lord Pirrie's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, who held it until the mid-1970s.
"Inequality is growing": Helsinki plans to reduce school assistants
There is no savings, says JHL.
A radical reduction in the number of school-specific school assistants is being prepared in Helsinki.
The deduction would not apply to the child's personal assistant.
The Helsinki Education Board ended up presenting a total of approximately 2.7 million qualifiers of the resources of school assistants in the spring.
Helsinki has a total of about 600 school assistants.
If the contractions are realized, they will take effect in the middle of the semester from the very beginning of the year.
According to the trade union JHL, the decision increases inequality.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunately easy to reduce assistants for austerity reasons, as the amount of support for learning is not clearly defined by law.
There will certainly be no savings, on the contrary, the workload of the teaching staff will increase.
For schoolchildren, savings bring an even greater risk of falling from learning goals and even teachers' coping is tough," emphasises Päivi Niemi-Laine, JHL's Director of Division.
The City of Helsinki plans inequality schools because with future resources, small schools and students in need of support will no longer receive any assistant resources at all.
The City of Helsinki's goal is to prevent exclusion.
Effective preventive work is done by school assistants.
However, the adjustment measures of the Education Agency are mostly aimed at this group.
All parties will suffer from this in the future.
The final solution to the resources will be made by the Helsinki City Council in the autumn, for which I hope to look far into the future and act in accordance with its goals," says Niemi-Laine.
Israel takes over the country in the West Bank
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement called Gevaot in the settlement of Etzion near Bethlehem.
Israel invaded nearly 400 hectares of land in the West Bank on Sunday in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel's future significant construction in the region, while defying the Palestinian request not to build more settlements and defy the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposes the expansion of West Bank settlements, felt that Sunday's events could be the largest single invasion of the country in the West Bank region for decades and could "dically change the situation in the region."
The Palestinians aim to establish their own state in the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
Israeli officials said the political stimulus to assess the situation in the land came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they hitchhiked in the area.
In July, Israeli officials arrested a Palestinian accused of being the main perpetrator of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the capture of the land suggests that it was intended as a kind of compensation for the population of the settlement and as punishment for the Palestinians.
Near Jewish Gevaot settlement, the land in the Etzion settlement of South Jerusalem has now been officially declared a "land of the state" when it used to be privately owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step for Israel to start designing buildings in the area if it wished.
However, Ahmad Lafi, mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said the country belonged to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news agency WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff released orders early on Sunday announcing that Israel would take over lands containing olive and other tree plantations in Surif and nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people caused the Israeli army to carry out a discipline in the West Bank against Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The subsequent tensions on the Israeli-Gaza border flared up in a 50-day war that ended last week with a ceasefire brought about by Egypt.
The invasion of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli-controlled West Bank and has revealed the Israeli government's conflicting goals, which are hampering the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Lapland crisis municipalities are usually multi-problem
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, according to a welfare study prepared by the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing the tasks of municipalities by one billion euros is not enough.
Common features of crisis municipalities include weak municipal finances, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Asko Suikkanen, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lapland, new crisis municipalities are coming from the western border and Eastern Lapland.
In the survey section of the survey, residents assessed their municipality's situation quite realistically.
Residents of well-performing municipalities in the study were even pessimistic about the outlook.
Weak expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present everyday life and well-being will survive, perhaps even slightly improve.
In this time, you don't dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a home," says Suikkanen.
The team surprised the large differences between municipalities.
For example, expenditure on income support per capita ranges from a couple of tens to well over 100 euros.
The tax revenue received by the municipality per capita ranges from over two thousand euros in Ranua to 4400 euros in Pelkosenniemi.
According to Suikkanen, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is spent, how much state shares are obtained, and what the degree of debt is, differs a lot even in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close borders to Islamist fighters returning to the country
Britain may temporarily prevent Islamist fighters who have left for Iraq and Syria from returning to their homeland.
This is reported by the BBC, referring to government sources.
However, the BBC said British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised and Prime Minister David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily seize passports of potential fighters at the border.
Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist threat to the second highest level on Friday.
Bob Carr rejoices in Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor's immediate release from Libyan prison
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan prison today.
The federal government was delighted with the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
A spokesman for Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "everything is going well" and an international criminal court lawyer will be released to Australian authorities tonight, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today," the spokesman told the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for their help and support," the spokesman said.
Taylor will likely fly to Rome before the trip to his home in The Hague.
Taylor and three of his colleagues in the Criminal Court were arrested in the Libyan city of Zittan on June 7 in their representation of Seif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
Libyan officials said Taylor took papers to Seif that they felt threatened national security.
Senator Carr has gone to great lengths to free Taylor, including traveling to the Libyan capital Tripoli last month to push for his cause.
Taylor couldn't have spoken to her husband or little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with Taylor's parents John and Janelle in Brisbane, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before her little child's third birthday in July.
The other three arrested criminal court lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of a debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal court lawyer was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding."
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of mistakes, but has promised to thoroughly investigate the actions of its team after its members return home.
"After the International Criminal Court concludes its investigation, it will ensure that anyone who has acted wrongly will be properly convicted," the court said in a statement last month.
The International Criminal Court is demanding trial of 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's reign, which ended unexpectedly last year.
Tripoli said his trial should be local and took an initiative on 1 May to announce that he would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in The Hague.
Young newcomer saved Barcelona - ESS.fi
Barcelona took their second win in the early stages of the Spanish Football League, but Villarreal did not fall easily at home.
Blue-reds pushed their heads to Villarreal watchman Sergio Asenjo until the 82nd minute finally succeeded.
The winning goal was scored by a surprising man: 19-year-old striker Sandro Ramirez, who made his first appearance in La Liga, had only come on the field 12 minutes earlier.
A young man who was invited from Barcelona's second team to the representative crew finished close after Asenjo rejected Lionel Messi's company.
Collections to Ferguson police mysteriously ended after $433,000 overrun
Administrators closed two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after sites raised over $400,000 for police officers who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity, open to the general public, two separate pages carrying similar names — "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" — have raised $235,750 and $197,620 for the Phergusonian police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by Brown's family attorney had raised $314,099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by several weeks of unrest and a demonstration mostly against black-populated Ferguson's near-white police force, forcing Wilson to hide while local and federal investigations are trying to decide if he shot Brown for no reason.
Network collection campaigns have created some controversy over Wilson's defense, especially since some visitors to the page had written racist comments in the comment section that have since been removed.
Both pages apparently stopped accepting donations at roughly the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators gave no reason for this.
As a visitor tries to make a donation, he sees a message saying "Donations are no longer accepted!
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
A representative of the GoFundMe website issued a statement to the Los Angeles Times on Sunday that the site has not prevented donations.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organizer decides for themselves when to stop receiving donations," Kelsea Little, a representative of GoFundMe, said in a statement.
Organizers can also continue to receive donations later if they wish.
The "Support Officer Wilson" page, with a return of $197,620, is maintained by the St. Louis Police Charity Group Shield of Hope, a donation recipient approved by GoFundMe.
Three police officers Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, who were registered as official representatives of the Shield of Hope State, did not respond to emails on Sunday asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official spokesperson for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council, located nearby, and a member of the Roorda Missouri House of Representatives.
The Times also failed to immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has raised $235,750. He has not been confirmed as a site-approved recipient of donations.
However, a GoFundMe spokesperson assured The Times in a statement that there is an anonymous benefactor.
Little information has been given about the anonymous benefactor of the collection campaign to donors, unlike those of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
An anonymous Wilson page benefactor wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago that the page is working with the Shield of Hope group to become an officially approved recipient of donations.
Approval has not yet been given.
The benefactor gave visitors who wanted more information a pseudonymous Gmail email address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to a request for more information.
A GoFundMe page spokesperson said in a statement to The Times that the anonymous collection page has been removed from the main site's search results and added that "the campaign in question no longer meets the requirements announced by GoFundMe that a working Facebook account should be used."
GoFundMe's information security policies encourage users to "donate only to GoFundMe users they know personally and trust."
Unfortunately, there is no valid guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
However, according to Representative Little, GoFundMe has "contacted the campaign organizer and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to withhold all funds raised if it is necessary to initiate investigations in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to withhold funds raised by that campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organized campaigns to support Wilson, told page followers over the weekend that lawyers are trying to find "explanation" why GoFundMe donors have been prevented from donating, but the page did not provide any other additional information.
The Facebook page also has an anonymous administrator and these comments have not been confirmed by an independent source.
Arsenal's top striker on the sidelines for the rest of the year - Premier League - Ilta-Sanomat
Olivier Giroud, French striker at the English Premier League Arsenal, is likely to be on the sidelines until the turn of the year.
Giroud's ankle was cut on Wednesday and recovery takes months.
Giroud injured his leg in a Premier League match against Everton this weekend.
The operation went well, but he is on the sidelines until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or early January," Arsenal head coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's best scorer last season with 16 hits, so the loss is substantial.
However, Wenger says he may not acquire a patcher for Giroud again during this transfer window.
Wenger was playing fresh acquisition of Alexis Sanchez at the top Wednesday in the Champions League qualifying final against Besiktas.
Arsenal won 1-0 with Sanchez's goal.

Finns trust the security of online banks
Most Finns rely on the security of online banks, according to Keskisuomalainen.
According to a survey commissioned by the magazine, four out of five consider online banking security to be good.
The age of the respondents is clearly reflected in the answers.
Young people, the least pensioners, believe in the security of online banks.
Tuula Sario, the leading lawyer for the Consumer Association, is not surprised by the views.
People who use a lot of the internet usually rely most on its services.
Those who do not use the services are ignorant and suspicious, he ponders in Central Finland.
Most Finns are customers of an online bank.
Most commonly, it is done on a computer, but the use of mobile devices is becoming more common all the time.
A thousand Finns responded to the survey by Tietoykkönen Oy in August.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
Jens Lapidus and Silta series screenwriter to make a crime series together
Jens Lapidus, one of Sweden's most famous crime writers, and Hans Rosenfeldt, a screenwriter who made the popular Bridge series, are jointly preparing a new TV series.
The filming of the ten-part Advocate series is scheduled to begin next year.
Swedish production company Tre Vänner announced the project in a statement on Monday.
The series was purchased by Swedish TV4.
The third author of the series is Michael Hjort.
Set in Stockholm, Advocaten tells the story of a young lawyer named Frank, who, in one case, finds dark connections between his own family and notorious criminal groups.
Lapidus, a crime writer who has risen to fame with the novel Money, is a defense attorney from his civilian profession.
