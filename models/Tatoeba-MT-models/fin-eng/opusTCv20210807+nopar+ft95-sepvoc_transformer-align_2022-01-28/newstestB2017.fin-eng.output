28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shopping mall
Only a 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his affairs in order."
The body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Franciscoan Frank Galicia, reports the San Francisco Forensic Agency.
San Francisco Police Department says the death is being investigated as a homicide.
Louis Galicia, the victim's brother, told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he became chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said death was a shock to them all.
"We're a small and close team, like a family, and we're sorry for the big one," the representative says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia says Frank first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his affairs in order.
"He found an apartment and had a girlfriend," Louis Galicia told KGO Station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to get into a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went with the flow.
Despite all the injustices that are happening in the world, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day," he says.
Anyone who knows anything about the incident is asked to call San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-4444.
Strike-out junior doctors call for new industrial action
Representatives of British junior doctors (mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new industrial action in the dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC), part of the British Association of Doctors (BMA), is asking its entire government for support for further industrial action from early September.
The JDC said ministers had not solved the problems with the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a July vote.
58% of the members who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, Ellen McCourt, chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, posted a letter to JDC members on Twitter saying the government "sneeds persistently" on issues that McCourt said led to the agreement being rejected.
The letter reads: "In light of this, the JDC government has voted to reject a completely new proposal for a treaty and calls for new formal negotiations to take place on all our concerns.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC government has today submitted a formal request to the BMA government requesting permission for gradual expanding industrial action since early September."
Due to the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, including the first complete work stoppages ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawiana, BMA's director of junior doctors, resigned after the vote, as he did not accept the negotiated terms of contract that BMA had recommended.
Malawina told BMA members at pre-vote meetings that the deal was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the deal would come into effect and apply to doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and bring to an official conclusion an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin accepted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of his St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The two sides did shake hands,
But Putin's smile looked thin and he didn't get much heat even by his own reserved standard.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin — five times, according to a report.
I myself did not keep count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would recover even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant coolness that exudes Putin showed that the Russian head has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the time of the incident was furious.
Putin attacked Ankara with strict words and accused him of stabbing his back.
The insult was even greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to regain true trust.
Public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations by top officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the allegations.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only held so that Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a truce to the harsh are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can have after he was almost deposed last month in a failed coup d'état.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive for reconciliation.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard, especially the charter flight ban, as several million Russian tourists normally travel to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has plummeted by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly sigh with relief as air traffic can eventually continue.
They put their faith in the late season rush to the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," was formulated in an article in the economic magazine Vedemost.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West, as it believes that the West is silently responding to the coup attempt.
Not forgetting the old grudge over Turkey's EU accession negotiations and Putin's intervention, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool relationship and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was self-evident to Moscow, which has its own concern about the change of power.
Thus, by their summit in a flashy seaside palace, Russia and Turkey could convey an image described by an analyst as a "external alliance": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, the two still have major disagreements.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It says a lot that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish president deliberately refused to answer the question of the differences between the two countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the two countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
Given the possibility of a total disaster caused by NATO member state Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, the two heads of state are again even speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the President of RBS Bank, the bank's operations outside Scotland will be reduced so that it will only provide business services, i.e. back office services, in the future.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally related to the bank's global goals.
The bank had to back down from its goals when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time, brand strategists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to enter the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be shortened to RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWest, except for headquarters and stock exchange listing.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, "RBS is becoming an investment brand and the one our staff are employed by because we are now becoming a bank of much more different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in their own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations-rugby, and has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"Now is the right time to move into a bank with different brands, because basically the question is how we can make the bank better for customers," says the bank's CEO.
"It would have been very sneering three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on customer needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettori rode Prediction to win at Newmarket and won his 3,000th win
Dettori sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which meant 3,000th profit for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th win in the British Championship in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone he reached by riding his horse Prediction twice to victory that night on the track of his own locality. Prediction is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in competitions running on a flat track.
He has previously been reached by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple champion jockey Dettori, who previously won in Ghayyar, says, "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket because this is where I ended up 30 years ago.
The competition event is not a large, not a Royal Ascot, but a perfectly ordinary Friday night and an audience of 20,000.
I am relieved and I feel great humility."
Dettori accepts cheers with Prediction after his win
Two jockeys have reached a milestone in obstacle race, and they are champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4,300 times in his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
He is elegant and strong, but his tactical usefulness is what sets him apart from the others.
He is a fantastic representative for racing, his enthusiasm and pruning has brought supporters to the sport for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 races already if he didn't just compete on weekends and only in big races!
Seriously, Frankie's riding career at the British Games has been victorious for almost 30 years, which has been great to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for British racing, but most of all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettori vented his achievement in a distinctive way by flying wildly down his horse's back.
"From flying finish to flying downs, Frankie Dettori has been a model example of British racing for two decades.
There have been ups and downs.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but has also survived a plane crash and been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban ended three years ago, he had initial start-up difficulties, but he showed admirable strength of character, showed his skeptics, and returned to his best.
And he won't be finishing his career for a while now — Dettori has recently said he wants to continue his racing career until he's at least 50."
Putin dismisses Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his head of government Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a member of Putin's trusted inner circle for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
According to a Kremlin statement, President Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but no justification for the dismissal was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to the position.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the Presidential Protocol Department and the Government Office, according to the Kremlin's Russian-language website.
Persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "I am grateful for your trust.
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your actions as head of state, which means making draft laws and monitoring how to implement the instructions you have issued."
Putin told a Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended Persecution as his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As Chief of Administration, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, shown by Russian state television, both said Ivanov would withdraw from the position at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations convince few, especially in the run-up to the parliamentary elections.
Are the fired the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man praised as a potential president suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, in which he says: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and, to some extent, difficult task for four years.
Now I have been the President's Chief of Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).
When Putin served as head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) that replaced the KGB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy chief.
As Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov might become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from being elected for a third term.
However, the mission went to another one close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to president just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds - FBI Investigators star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute on set in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, said in a joint statement.
Gibson, known as Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, had apologized Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
"We had creative differences.
I regret that this happened," he said in a statement.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the series following FBI agents will be released later, according to a statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old Gibson, who previously starred in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since its first season, 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
"I was hoping to see the series until the end, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly: the best fans the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th season of the series will begin in the United States on September 28.
The Mysterious Landing of Fish in the Banffian Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects these 75 fish are windfish that have been sucked by a cyclone on the ground.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the seashore, published footage of the vision at Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
Queensferry Overpass is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and land bridge of the Queensferry transit bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four sections between the "cover fans", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 slanted wires.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Keith Brown, the finance minister, visited the site today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry transit bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in building the bridge, with over 30,000 concrete and steel used to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight, building a bridge section between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge deck is now in place at almost 79%, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete deck casting in Rosyth today, which means the deck is ready to be lifted into place."
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always a significant urine column in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this proportion represents the top of the road and civil engineering sector.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the road deck of the North Tower column, we then had to close the remaining North-side (i.e. terrestrial) gap.
This was done by pulling the northern land bridge 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time highly accurate operation.
Massive because the land bridge is 222 metres long and about 6,000 tonnes in weight and had to be pulled up at a slope angle of about 3%.
And high precision, because the tolerances that the work team had to follow were very small —just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells of three men's miracle rescue
The three men who were caught in water off Anglesey were miraculously saved.
Moelfre RNLI Sea Rescue Station set an alert on Friday at 1:20 p.m. local time after its crew detected an accident in Moelfre Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued its reckless passage without a pilot.
"We saw the boat circling right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who drives the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got out, fortunately, strong winds had carried the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, aged 60, was found exhausted clinging to the buoy and without a life jacket.
They were all picked up in a coastal rescue boat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It's a miracle these three men who are caught up in the water are still alive and perfectly fine.
The boat's engine had an emergency firecracker, but for some reason it had come off from the man who was driving the boat during the fall.
They were really lucky on their way."
Pokémon Go Hunt Brings Health and Happiness
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to stay inside and stare at their screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, only watching TV took time, then video games and most recently smartphones came.
It is great to see that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
With this, of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go fad. Pokémon Go is a game app whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later also made a cartoon series, playing cards and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this stopped shortly before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries was delayed due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users in Pokémon Go passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
How does the game work?
In short, players go out to find pokémon on their smartphones, which are monitored using GPS. When a pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (with the help of a phone screenshot) or "capture".
The fad has caught up with the generation who played the video game when they were younger and has lifted the butts off the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that a "average person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported that the Apple Watch smartwatch from the Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game's launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data on the amount of exercise.
Many public health campaigns that encourage people to get off the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day have fallen on deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Regularly mobile people have a lower chance of developing cancer or depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes, and brings a large number of other benefits.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it makes people out to do something they enjoy.
This is how it achieves three basics that support health — exercise, fresh air, and sun and joy.
During the hunt, it is even possible to make new friends.
As usual, the disapproving spoilers of joy that are part of this phenomenon.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door while playing.
What about it?
The breakthrough is done.
For while smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track your activity earlier, they did not give you a reason to start, as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty will disappear, and use will decrease in due course.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the physical activity of people going on the hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's rack gymnastics multi-match
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
Effortless on the boom.
The jaws fall on the perm.
Brilliant in everything.
And now finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American rack gymnast won the multi-match championship on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic spotlight.
His total score on February 62, 1898 was clearly better than that of silver-based "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States will perform at the boom in the multi-match final of the women's rack gymnastics individual competition on Thursday at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and all-time fifth American woman to win the multi-match championship, thus strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears as his total final point became visible and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement takes the sport to completely new dimensions and puts him in the same class as other superstars in sports, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely superior to his kind for the past three years. He has won 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and punctual programs that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the greatest rack gymnast of all time."
There was one last race left in Brazil, primarily between Bales and himself and the burden of over-exploitations, not so much between Bales and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.

Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of the i for the going-away of Martha Karoly, who coordinated the national team and now retired.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought of anything in advance while on top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program — which includes a volt series known as his trump card — is adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
As a child of his grandparents, adopting and finding Coach Aimee Boorman's mother has become a power figure. Boorman found the girl while she was on a daycare tour of the gymnastics hall where Boorman coached.
He has not lost a single multi-match competition since the summer of 2013, and the winning streak will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina made a small lead with two threads, it was like mirage.
What remained was a boom and a perm, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He regained leadership after receiving 15.433 points from the boom and crowned the result with a 15.933 points from the perm.
Raisman gently hugged him while they were waiting for the final points — which was just a formality — and tears began to appear around Bales' red, white, and blue glittering crop color when the dream he once wrote in his clipbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small rematch for a four-year-old race when he first split third place but then lost bronze to Mustafina in the re-round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, who the Americans call the team "mummy" was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent jet kisses to the public after his permanto program, thus becoming the winner of the losing position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As for Biles, the tweet that this 19-year-old made earlier in the week and spread out now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three music people in the car were victims of serial killers
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating massacre in ten years, with victims sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, a police bulletin released Thursday said.
Officials say that on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the street.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he fired eight shots with a handgun and then escaped in another car.
Police suspect that the cause of the triple killing was probably not a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 found in the possession of another adult victim.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says police are now investigating whether the killing is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in Latin American-populated areas within four months.
"The events have in common that they have occurred in residential areas off homes," Howard told KPHO, a subsidiary of CBS, a television and radio company, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan of the late 1990s, the black BMW of the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Scientists do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are interrelated and that their perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that the trio had often sat in the car listening to music.
Police also issued a statement saying that the shooting against an empty pickup truck was only half an hour before the triple killing, and the shooter is believed to be the same in both cases.
The researchers found shell casings and recovered bullet fragments from the car seat and the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things get better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital minority, due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto's genetic disorder, which she was unaware of while pregnant.
"When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I wouldn't get away with this.
I'm not gonna get away with this.
I'm not committed to this.
What is not true at all - of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and may not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think such a practice would exist at all anymore," says Picciuto.
Edmund walks with the help of a rollator.
Edmund didn't sit up and started crawling until he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invented sign, with which she means "sing me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean ordinary sign language, but also includes signs invented by Edmund himself.
There may be several different diseases behind microcephaly: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zikavirus.
Symptoms and predictions have a great variation.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zikaviruses.
Picciuto recalls the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept saying, 'What will happen to us,
What will happen to us."
And he still doesn't know.
"I haven't asked for a prognosis in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciuto has hope-giving advice for mothers whose children have congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
"Things get better.
Things tend to work out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
Heavy rains and floods cause major rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi states
The governor of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Friday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding, and more rains on the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are flooded over their banks and spread over a wide area as a result of strong heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office for National Safety and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency would receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele says Tangipahoa County alone has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most of South Louisiana.
According to a press release issued by the weather service, there may be another 76-227 mm of water entering the area.
A flood warning was issued in southern Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile region.
Over the weekend, near the Comite River, Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each in Louisiana, are predicted to reach record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses along rivers may be flooded in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He also says that floods downstream in Ascension County pose a threat, as flooded rivers slowly drain into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, which flows in Liverpool, Louisiana, just south of the Mississippi State border, had risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were previously close to Gloster on Friday among those rescued.
Hansford, 62, reports that the Beaver Creek River, normally more than 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
Another stepson living nearby had warned him.
"We got up, and water came in with a constant pass," Hansford says.
"It reached my waist."
The wife had told Hansford that she has never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the region.
Hansford says that he and his family members all have injuries, and he is the only one with swimming skills.
Rescue workers had rescued all three into a large army-style truck and taken them to a fire station at Gloster, where they held shelter on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods will spread rapidly as heavy rain continues, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells of information from an observer near Livingston that it had rained nearly 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says the soil grew strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and street flooding, residents of Tangipahoa County had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of Tangipahoa City Council had told WWL, a subsidiary of the television and radio company CBS, that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has reached both.
County leader Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been captured by the flood.
Protective places have been opened for the evacuated in the cities of Amite and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water starts to retreat," he says.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa County, nearly twenty streets had to be closed due to the flood, and sandbags were offered to the residents to try to prevent water from entering their homes and their businesses.
"For the previous time, we experienced a major flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, a member of the City Board.
"This flood seems similar."
In Mississippi, rains continued to be steady along the Gulf coast, says Rupert Lacy, rescue director at Harrison County.
Lacy says that a handful of houses under the flood were reported on Thursday, but there had been no information so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before, and it's raining all the time."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown with multiple bullets into his body survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already the second 6-year-old to have been shot in the city this week.
Grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents said the boy had several gunshot wounds in his groin, leg, arm, and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"She got many hits, her little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez to the television company.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to be surviving.
He was starting his first grade in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also shot.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, CBS Philadelphia reports.
The television company said the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a critical 29-year-old.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The venue was full of assault gun-type shell casings from various assault weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the sidewalk.
Several armed fighters have been present and have been actively involved in the shooting," Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
Bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and it is heard that police are going through surveillance videos.
Another 6-year-old who was the victim of a shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was hit by an stray bullet while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering, and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
With this name, I call the Olympic team of women's rack gymnastics, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as superior as it is now.
Second, the three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's lineup, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally represents America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the best female rack gymnast has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became the surprise winner of the Games, and all of America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances and surprising and masterful rack gymnastics programs of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in a multi-match of the women's individual competition on Thursday.
Teammate Aly Raisman, on the other hand, won silver.
The views are like this at the top of the sport, but it doesn't look the same in rack gymnastics classes across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), as the next Olympic team of rack gymnastics will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that rack gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private rack gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid for by training costs, facilities, trips, costumes, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnasts and family members), etc.
Most rack gymnastics clubs are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support operations.
The teaching of rack gymnasts takes place in these clubs, and it means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
Simone Bales coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have both coached sports enthusiasts since they started gymnastics.
We need to provide cheaper and better available rack gymnastics education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm Simone, Gabby and Laurie have aroused.
I started my own rack gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My Harlem-based organizations have provided a free or affordable opportunity for rack gymnastics for over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latin American), some of whom have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality rack gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Stand gymnastics develops strength, suppleness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings life-long benefits and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has sparked enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start gymnastics, and that's just great.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won Olympic gold and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start their way into healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes to pay and working conditions by accepting a renewed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but 58% of the 37,000 so-called junior doctors, or specialist doctors, who took part in the vote rejected the proposal.
In July, Health Minister Hunt announced plans to reach an agreement under duress and said the British Public Health System (NHS) was "no one's land" and that any further delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices to improve health care in antisocial times.
Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Medical Committee, issued a statement last night saying: "The junior doctors are still very reserved for the proposed agreement, with particular fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks before the first doctors are transferred to the new contract, so now we need to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctant to discuss attempts and sometimes even without reacting in any way.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt making a promise last month that his door will always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, repeal the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this does not happen, junior doctors are ready for further industrial action."
The previous strike at the end of April postponed nearly 13,000 routine procedures and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support the doctors on strike in the strike guard.
Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute over the changes by concluding a renewed agreement with union staff representing British doctors.
Trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54,000 junior doctors who would be covered by the contract.
NHS employee CEO Daniel Mortimer appealed to junior doctors not to take new strikes.
Mortimer says: "Working actions achieve very little or nothing, but they create pressure on teams and services already at the limit and cause concern, distress and disruption to patients, medical staff and their families.
For the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other parties, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of grievances.
Employees were hopeful that a continued positive commitment to other important topics — such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for those returning from career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, study leave and gender pay gap in the care sector — were a sign of how seriously workers, Health Education England, responsible for health education, and the Ministry of Health want to stick to the agreements with BMA in November, February and May."
A drug costing €2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about €2.40 a day when authorities recommended that it be given to more people and for longer-term use.
Anti-coagulation drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The drug is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be administered to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence), part of the UK Public Health System (NHS), has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, one quarter of whom repeat a heart attack or have a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is fat that accumulates in the walls of blood vessels, which generates plaques.
If plaque ruptures, it can give rise to a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot comes off, it can pass with the blood flow and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is higher in people who have had a heart attack once.
Dikagrelor, manufactured by British AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of plugs.
The NICE draft guideline published today recommends that ticagrelor be administered next 90 mg for 12 months, then reduced to 60 milligrams and given twice a day for another three years.
Carole Longson, professor at the Center for the Implementation of Treatment Methods (NICE), says: "While effective methods of treatment to effectively prevent the progression and onset of symptoms of the disease are available, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack will have a new seizure or stroke — often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on a person's quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in terms of the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guideline does not recommend the use of the treatment method for any longer period of time.
Due to the climate that fosters political correctness, voting fraud in Muslim areas flourished
Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was dismissed from office last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government
The climate of political correctness led to the closure of the eyes from widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, a government report published today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles severely criticized the police, election observers and city councils for closing their eyes to electoral fraud "due to hypersensitivity to ethics and religion."
According to Pickles, known as the former Minister of Regional Government and the current anti-corruption force figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that police should have had permission to form guard chains outside polling stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He suggests that voters should present an ID in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At present, the voter must only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to dip fingers in in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be done for whistleblowers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for journalists to be able to access Government documents and decisions of informal boards and working groups to be improved.
"The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and a culture that favours them more broadly in local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report after the vote scandal in Tower Hamlet, East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should resign due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court held that Rahman "fakely" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and dampened his critics by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to "use as a basis for his campaign the religious duty of every believer Muslim to vote for him."
As many as 300 of the votes were questionable or fraudulently given by the person voting by pretending to be some other person.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was obtained throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-election fraud in which high-ranking members of the Muslim community were reported to have pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring identification at the polling station.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable members of ethnic minority groups, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of older members, especially in communities with Pakistan and Bangladesh backgrounds."
"There was concern that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots from political activists to prevent "voice harvesting".
The report under consideration by Theresa May also requires stricter checks on registration to prevent the use of the voting register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consideration of options requiring voters to present identity documents before voting.
Baptizing fingers in in indelible ink after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibition of the handling of completed mailed votes and mail voice envelopes by political activists.
Police have the right to form guard chains around polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to prosecute under the Representation of the People Act of 1983 on the Extension of Voting Rights.
Prohibition of photography at polling stations.
Only allowing English at polling stations (except Wales).
More effective training to ensure that staff monitor the rule that only one person can enter the voting booth at a time.
Sir Eric severely criticizes the London police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet incident.
"The election court dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representative for their role in corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found guilty without serious suspicion and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective " tick inspections" of the departments responsible for the city council's electoral lists.
"The court's decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by the worrying and covert electoral fraud and its denial by some parties."
Olympic cyclist's resemblance to Duchess Catherine and other doppelgangers go wild at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild this week from French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge is amazing.
But according to discussions on social media, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is by no means the only athlete fighting for the championship who has a resemblance to a known person.
In honor of the Rio Games and all the well-known faces flashing on our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympic representatives whose resemblance to Hollywood celebrities is obvious.

"I don't see the resemblance as big, maybe except for the beard and the mustache," Brady Huffington told the Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm taking this as a compliment."
The 2012 London Games were about the resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris, which is undoubtedly even more highlighted in these games.

CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonalds' analysis instead of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message stunned viewers of CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize since one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost smelling" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to shoot his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle note final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC commentary team to bring color, was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left fast, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the message at 1:57.79, and stayed 1.61 seconds from Taylor Ruck, Canada, which allowed Canadians to swim to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the commentator's tone and language.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
In the final of the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle message, swimming Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with furious Byron MacDonald critical comments, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold back their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
Tweeter Sarah Paradis wrote, "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group. #responsive."
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, quickly regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the swimming performance.
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
CBC eventually had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Commissioner Scott Russel had to offer apologies on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued his apologies to comments from over 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald's speeches.
The TV company also quickly made a public apology.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for their access to the broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on last night's broadcast, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald expressed regret at the broadcast and tried to justify his speeches by saying he didn't mean it was personal.
"I want to apologize for my comment I made last night after the women's message swim," MacDonald said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
Needless to say, I meant nothing derogatory with my words, and I am very sorry."
In Primark, without blocking underwear in the middle of the store, the woman who adapted the store shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to look when she undressed in the middle of Primark to fit her underwear.
He further exacerbated the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to tour and eventually tried four pairs of underwear at a store in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Folkestone's Primark chain shop at Bouverie Place shopping centre, where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two at the same time in the store, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He says of what happened: "People couldn't believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tights and underwear, and put it on.
He did not try to do it discreetly, but did it without shame.
Everyone stared when he took the underwear he tried off and apparently didn't like it because he put it back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding he didn't like anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the looks — and he didn't think about the person who would eventually buy the underwear he had come to."
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent town, continues, "How disgusting to think that someone is taking to their home underpants that someone else has worn and have not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the store staff was trying to remove those items from sales after the woman left — which is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and find that someone else has tried them without being washed since then," adds Davidson.
A spokesman for Primark commented on the matter by saying: "Primark is aware of the situation in its Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale."
How to Defend Yourself Against Armed Attack with Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video found at Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Rhon Mizrach, Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York City, and asked for advice on how to cope with a robber or abuser waving a gun in close range.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or from the back.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun so that it gets between your elbow and upper arms, and strike the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker with a knee in the groin, and when he goes double in pain, slap him in the face with a barrel of a gun and back off by holding the gun directed at him.
The technique is equivalent if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You have to move off the firing line, grab a gun, and twist it so that the attacker cannot trigger.
At the same time, place your weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest with a fist. Turn the gun away from the attacker's grip, back off and keep the gun targeted at the attacker.
Does that sound tricky?
Watch the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, though, that you are the safest to get rid of the robber by handing over your cash — unless you are the Krav Maga Grand Master.
World traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places
The British world traveler put his resistance and pooping reflexes to a hard test by licking Europe's dirtiest and most repulsive places.
Suffolk host and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro banknote, handrail Piccadilly Circus, train toilet flush button and Russian public phone.
Before licking, Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see for himself and show the viewers where he was pushing his tongue.
The experiment was made into a documentary film Ian Wright - On the trail of inner power, and its results surprised.
The idea of licking the toilet flush button on a train can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about strengthening good bacteria in the intestines and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked caused anything but a bad-tasting mouth.
Ian Wright originally became known for his travel program, in which he tested the endurance of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Licking the handrails and toilet flush button at the railway stations undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the documentary, "Since I was a child, I've been quite carefree about my health and put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and mud water."
In the film, he really showed himself to be worthy of his reputation.
The border came only in a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
By comparison, the number in newly washed hands is usually less than 60.
The border came across a Russian public toilet where Wright refused to lick when the luminometer measured 4,000 units as a result — in newly washed hands, the same number is less than 60.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright - On the trail of inner power, where the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom, is made visible.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any toilet.
4000 units, nothing's dirtier than that!
The place is so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced the documentary Ian Wright - On the trail of inner power in collaboration with Valio.
Valio Wright received Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the good bacterial strain and resistance of the intestines.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Category Manager of Valio snack, juice and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time tells of the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time brainstorming something crazy, and eventually we ended up thinking of asking Ian to come along."
Intestinal health has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a broader context rather than just talking about products and tell about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
Intestinal health has become a global trend and the document allows us to provide consumers with additional information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds to this: "Let's say I would have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain items we asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Naturally, licking some items was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows filmed on tape."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84% of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria, especially to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% reported using products with added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Before his eviction, the troublemaker family destroyed a city-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall
The troublemaker family left behind the £50,000 damage to the city-owned rental house after they had been evicted for terrorizing the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after numerous complaints against the couple.
After the couple had been forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company found shocked that the apartment was in renovation condition.
There were gaping openings on the walls, floorboards had been torn off, debris had been applied to the floors and the walls had been smeared with graffiti.
The couple has now moved and are believed to live in a private residence.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says she fears that the apartment may no longer be able to be saved.
He says, "This has been a total nightmare for the people who live here, no one should have to put up with this.
There is much to weigh on, as the property is likely to become known as a not so pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, just like its name."
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment from time to time, and police said the family's tyranny included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of close residents, drug use and caring, and loud shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, who signed the lease, received an antisocial behavior order in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the house under threat of demolition.
Drugs had previously been sold from the house, and floorboards had been torn off.
Neighbors said the family was fighting on the street and police had to be called regularly.
Cornwall Housing Department forcibly evicted the couple this week after giving them 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The relieved neighbors were grateful for the eviction —they said their lives were hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We have lived next door to them for 20 years, and that whole time has been difficult.
The police have been here incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it!
It will be wonderful now that they have finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Director of Forced Implementation at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which police were regularly called.
Garbage and old toys had been thrown into the wild wall of the rented house.
Fitzpatrick adds, "It's a pity the tenant didn't take any responsibility for his own and his family's behavior, as eviction is always the last action Cornwall Housing Agency is considering.
This incident was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to look at in the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and community members who participated in the work and offered to boldly give us information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of our neighbours and send the message that antisocial behavior will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
Dirty mattress found in one bedroom of the house after eviction
Housing workers now need to clean out the piles of waste surrounding the house.
Police raided the apartment in 2014 and found over 70 grams of cannabis, plus scales and other supplies, as well as £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after being found guilty of possession of a Class B drug with the intention of selling it.
He claimed that the money was for the tombstone of his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard to have moved to a private residence in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were stained with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding eviction for tenants who violate the rules of leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall Police say this eviction serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly defy the rules.
"This is a clear message to those who think they can behave however they want without charge, as well as those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and antisocial behavior, and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Army jet that flew low, hit the beach scared tourists in Portugal
Sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Air Force's P-3C Orion aircraft crashed staggeringly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists panicked when a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army aircraft comes almost within touch distance of tourists sunbathing on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers got on their feet, worrying understandably about the thunder of the jet engines, which began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the holidaymakers who filmed the dramatic flyby and posted videos on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who relates: "It passed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on Aveiro's beach were shocked when the plane suddenly became visible and flew staggeringly low.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the aircraft had to fly so low.
The pilot said they had to fly a little lower than normal because smoke from nearby forest fires hindered visibility, but the Air Force said this did not threaten anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused havoc in parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that due to the poor visibility caused by the heavy fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, in which the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Exote's first half result better than expected
The South Karelia Social and Health District (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned in January - June.
Exote's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was realized in all activities.
This year, Eksote is working to shorten the lines of action.
Exote covers the deficit that has arisen in the past with a surplus.
The excess portion of it may be used to shorten queues and buy procedures for patients.
The full-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Directors of Eksote will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Jaegers sworn in military oath in Immola
70 military officers from the Border and Coast Guard School took a military oath on Friday.
The military oath of the Border and Coast Guard School conscripts was held in Immola on Friday.
The tenth Special Border Jaeger Course was held on the garrison sports field.
70 conscripts were sworn in by a military oath.
Special border Jaegers are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people applied to become a special border Jaeger.
250 of them were invited to the entrance exams.
Special border Jaegers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting, held in connection with the Vala event, involved five veterans of the wartime border forces.
The average age of those involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans to attend the event were born in 1918.
A lot of bandits ahead - criminal intelligence helps solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police departments in Finland has been operating an RTA, or criminal intelligence and analysis unit, since the beginning of 2014.
The unit's operation is invisible on the outside.
At the Häme Police Department, the unit consists of a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Chief Officer is in Inspector Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian uniform.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for the rest of the police.
In Häme, it has, among other things, acquired information about asylum seekers.
Latest reform of working methods
The establishment of analysis units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The goal has been to prevent crime, i.e. that the police would less and less leave the place of the whistles until they received an alarm.
The information collected and analyzed by the unit is used to target daily police activities where it is most needed.
With the reform of the police administration, one criminal intelligence centre, less than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit were established in the country.
The PTR Centre, which operates in Vantaa in connection with the National Bureau of Investigation, leads operations nationally.
As the name suggests, people work in PTR units from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTA units, on the other hand, work in areas divided by police departments and are tasked with providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Intelligence extends beyond one's own territory
While an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, it is up to the RTA unit to know what is happening throughout the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the boundaries of one's own institution, because so does crime.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the basic police.
The unit uses registers, alarm task database and observations to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes.
This is called serialization, and is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the author forms a certain image.
The placement can be done either on the basis of the method of the act or on the basis of the person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA unit employees do not go up collars in the city, but their work is not entirely public either.
Both own and criminal methods are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent police crime prevention attempts.
Police publicly state the methods if they anticipate they will pose a threat.
Such a case was, for example, the method of marking empty dwellings reported in early summer, used in housing burglaries.
In it, the authors put a stick, a pin or a piece of tape on the front door of the apartment to see if the residents were really traveling.
Pre-trial investigation material is public to at least the parties involved.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from the mistakes they make.
The most clever order the district court minutes, which may, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with gloves in our hands.
For the case, an interview has been conducted with Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppä from Häme Police, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the Eastern Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyze information to plan practical activities.
This is due to a reduction in labour and funding volumes.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken as early as 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
London schoolgirl killed in Syria
News reports that one in three British schoolchildren who joined ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee says the girl's family heard that Sultana died in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike on Raqqa, an ISIS base in Syria, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, just planning to escape from a war-torn country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and will for people to understand that this is a real risk when entering a war zone - and that will cause people to give up the decision to leave," says Akenjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, along with two other East London schoolgirls, boarded a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed just a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as a Supreme Court judge if elected president.
Republican delegates in the Senate have refused to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the next president would elect a person to fill the seat of the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a teleconference on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "with almost great certainty."
Reid's spokesperson later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't want to "squeeze the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal in Columbia County District.
Reid says the Republicans who block Garland's appointment are presidential candidate Donald Trump's "commanders" and "predepositors."
He said Trump was not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars belong as well to women as to men
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemere and introduces a calendar made in the 1970s style and inspired by Pirelli for 2017.
Instead of celebrity nude models, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity-drinking magazine is different from the old-school Playboy magazines, as he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women."
Apparently, he thinks the same thing about the calendar.
"We have to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where women, just like men, can effortlessly enjoy and be inspired by these images praising the female body," says Shaw in a press release about the calendar.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art."
Those who want to model into a calendar can send their photos online or attend open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can write an angry objection to the comment section under the pseudonym EivaAll LonelyMedium Men, this claim is based on real research data.
According to YouGov research company, behind the new arrival of much-spoken vinyl records is not a millennial generation boom when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead have midlife nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, those in the age group 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
It is also not just the desire of enthusiasts to get records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl record buyers are a little more likely to keep their emotions hidden (56% in 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% in 66%).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me as I walked down the lively Soho Street, wearing a unscrupulous grey jacket. I would gesture livelyly, bend my hands into a cup, and say something traditional, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and jaggedness, as hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over facilities owned by private entrepreneurs before, there are still a handful of specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment as I get very close to the men who visit these shops and try to observe their age and character.
Stuart, 55 from Glasgow, whom I follow from the Sister Ray movement (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (at that time eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-year-old woman) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time exploring the store offerings.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
"I have about 3,000 to 3,000 records."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent a picture to me via email, I didn't follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his disposable income. He is now able to buy records he could not afford when they originally appeared, and buy again things he had had to sell when he was young and broke.
"I got a lot of stuff from the late '60s and early '70s that came out when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy vinyl records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's my vice."
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media hype, and these people have heard of vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"Based on the discussions I had had, people had generally abandoned their collections around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This can explain the boom of vinyl-awakened people of certain ages.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In just a few seconds, you realize in a movement like Phonica that they provide a comforting community for like-minded guys.
According to Wez, some older customers have been particularly upset by the contactless payment system.
The digital world may be overwhelmed by some vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar disk cases means permanence and reminds of the lucky days of youth.
"I think it sometimes fills some gap or material possessions are acquired for some kind of consolation," says Wez.
"This is how I feel as a collector myself, and I believe that so do many others.
It's an easy way to get your mind off the ground."
"We're like social workers!" swoops Wez's co-worker from behind the plate stack.
An ICM poll in April revealed that nearly 50% of those who bought a vinyl album the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
A poll also reported that 41% have a turntable they never use, and 7% of vinyl record buyers don't have their own turntable at all.
At this point in the newscast, I would probably look like a serious face while browsing a stack of bossa nova collections.
The re-emergence of vinyl records is also accompanied by a "pocal phenomenon" observed by Jonny, 42, a salesman of the Sounds of the Universe movement (currently three middle-aged men).
"A customer recently came to the store and said he didn't have a turntable, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he could put it on his shelf," Jonny says.
"The proportion of such customers is not high, but there are.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a turntable yet.
They are younger, not older, largely teenage, who are just starting a hobby."
The customer base is much more varied in Foppi, where I will arrive next. The store has dedicated an entire layer to vinyl records.
Customers include couples in their 70s, tourists taking photographs, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The diversity of customers is gratifying, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of the jazz swinging from the speakers, Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer pop is seeping sex.
None of the clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect gnawing psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fop for a few minutes and watching various records on sale.
He's more like watching than shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect records.
"They cost a lot.
Music is easy to listen to from a computer or otherwise, but the fineness of the liquor is ...," he lets go of the lovely sigh and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jeans shorts, but who instead gather around Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see a father and daughter thinking about buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just an interior element and some so high that they can't even reach them.
They are pure "art vinyl" interior.
But given that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money for the industry and send a few customers on a search trip to Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population group most likely to have more time and money than most also has the group that spends the most money on luxuries such as vinyl records.
Although my research shows that YouGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings loitering at Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old who plays a television host, staring frighteningly and looking at unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest living vertebrate — video report
Scientists say the longest-living vertebrate on Earth is an ice shark.
According to shark researcher Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice shark was aged between 272 and 12 years in the study, a five-metre-long female.
French court rejects application for demolition of jungle camp shops
A French court has rejected an application from the Calais authorities demanding the demolition of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in a jungle camp inhabited by thousands of refugees.
In a court hearing this week, Calais authorities made allegations that the state should be allowed to break up 72 temporary trades established in a refugee camp. Shops sell different goods from tobacco to energy drinks to residents of a refugee camp and offer haircuts. At temporary restaurants, you can buy tea for 50 cents or basic meals for a few euros.
According to Calais prefect authorities, these shops and restaurants must be demolished because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals provided by a state-sponsored organization and other parties are not enough for the ever-growing population of the camp.
They say that temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those who need it.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling 72 temporary traders, but considered Calais' prefect's concerns to be "completely understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp's grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are of far greater importance than just providing food to people who "live in extremely unstable conditions."
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under threat of demolition was the Jungle Book Kids café in the camp, which is non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours, and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of unaccompanied minors, whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition requiring children's coffee shops to be preserved.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that since the sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record 9,000.
Food prices in Finland fall clearly faster than the EU average
Food in Finland is sharply reduced to the pleasure of consumers and the harm of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by nearly five per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries its price fell by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the past three years, the price of food has fallen most in Finland in those EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
Only in the UK has food prices fallen faster than in Finland.
The data are shown in Statistics Finland's writing by Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen, which was published on the Tieto & Trends blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data are from June this year.
In the early 2010s, the price of food rose strongly.
In 2013, prices climbed close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed a turnaround, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
Now the price is weighed down by the Russian bans on food imports, which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of dairy and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," Lehtinen says.
Tightened price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the fall in price.
Large retail chains S Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been reflected in spectacular advertising campaigns.
Finland is still not a haven of affordable food, although the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a salary level similar to that of Finland.
According to Lehtinen, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if control countries had the same VAT rate, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from countries with similar wage levels.
Lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the control countries, only Germans and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of old EU countries in the price of food, VAT must be halved to the average level of EU countries and continue price competition," Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen points out that the calculations he has made at the VAT rate are indicative.
School is no longer quite the same.
A person returning to school may find that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all primary schools.
It is a guideline that all Finnish schools operate.
Schools decide the details themselves, but the plan tells the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the learning of fiction is abandoned, and instead, schools begin to practice coding.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social studies are already being read in the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that a teacher teaches students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how people try to make school more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus), known as ice sharks, does not reach sexual maturity until the age of 150.
It can live another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lasting vertebrate in the modern world.
In the animal kingdom, it is only passed by an Icelandic clam, the oldest known individual of which is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch longer than dogs, they can grow up to more than five metres.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to follow-up, only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have been living for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues from the University of Copenhagen found out.
He defined the ages of adult ice sharks from 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of the fish was revealed by radiocarbon dating of eye lenses.
The average age of the sharks studied proved to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimetre Amazon fins, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have found that ice shark females only reach sexual maturity by more than four metres, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 - sellers will not be deducted
Nearly 300 employees will be laid off from Stockmann, a department store company.
The partner companies in the company that got into trouble ended in early August.
"The negotiations will result in a reduction of approximately 300 jobs, most of which will be implemented as redundancies," Stockmann said in a statement.
It states that the number of sellers in department stores will not be reduced to prevent customer service from suffering.
In addition, approximately 80 employees of the support functions are offered new work as sellers.
Stockmann's co-operation negotiations concerned approximately 3,000 employees.
At the start of these, the reduction need was estimated to be approximately 380 employees.
The reduction in the population aims to achieve annual cost savings of approximately EUR 20 million, which are due to be realised next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann's difficulties in making the department store trade profitable are behind it.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, the department store transaction still makes losses.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Acting CEO of Stockmann, sales in department stores have not achieved the goals set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personnel reductions are necessary to ensure Stockmann Retail's positive operating result in 2018," Veijalainen says in a statement.
The second quarter performance improvement was based on the good success of the clothing chain Lindex in particular.
The chain achieved its best ever second quarter revenue and results.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the entire Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from last year.
Adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is rainiest in the north - temperature less than 20 degrees throughout the country
The low pressure centre on the northern part of Finland keeps the weather rainy on Friday, says HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
Rain showers also occur in the central part of the country, but further south is the pout.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees Celsius throughout the country.
In the rainy areas of the north, you stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan athletics team shaken by doping scandal - coach's rapture strange explanation
Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah was an athlete for the national team in a doping test.
The AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to perform is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan national team leader, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after giving a sample as Rotich in a surprise test.
Doping officials reported to Anzrah authorities.
Soi said Anzrah was sent home because he "made his crimes against Kenya's national team."
He performed as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour," Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, said in a statement to Reuters.
Olympic athletics begin on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run at that time.
It is not yet known if the runner has any consequences as a result of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth last year at the World Cup and is in advance Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, a source inside the Kenyan athletics team claimed that Anzrah only went with an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid of being exposed," the source said.
Where is everybody?
Rio Athletics Stadium rubbers its emptiness
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium, following athletics.
A battle for athletics medals began in Rio on Friday, but the world's top individuals were allowed to present their skills to a confusingly empty stands.
Rio organizers said on Friday that only 58% of the first-day morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging with cheering people.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics have attracted attention even before athletics.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the stands for rugby, canoeing and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medal hopes Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the stands were full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000-person stands were only filled with about 30%.
The bad sales are explained at least by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian race tourists, and many of the Olympic sports are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
Even the first game of the Brazilian football team was not able to pull out the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a spokesperson for the race organizers, said that 82% of the tickets had been sold at the time, a clearly lower figure than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada said.
Of the 8.5 million tickets at the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half as much as in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have varied from about nine euros to over 1,000 euros at the opening.
More than half of the tickets cost less than 16 euros.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this has not yet been allowed because the organizers need money and are trying to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known sports such as golf and rugby.
Rio Stadium had empty seats this morning.
Even the beach volleyball on Copacaba sand has not interested the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London in 2012.
There were enough people in the gallery.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through new means.
Founded last year, the foundation acquires ecologically significant nature areas.
Thereafter, private individuals, companies and entities can redeem holder rights to the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that those who wish to acquire for payment of the holder's right.
The holder receives a veto on his 187 square meter block, which means in practice that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more than one block.
Obtaining a right of control is something concrete that can be left as an inheritance or given as a gift.
You don't have to go and carry banners or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," explains Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the right to control his company.
The person who acquired the right to manage receives accurate location information from their block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website is home to the name information of the holder rights acquirers on the same map where the country block information can be found.
Leviäkangas sees only the risk of its nature conservation acquisition that the Foundation's operations will change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is established as a foundation of general interest, the purpose of which is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would act somehow unethically or commercially, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea behind the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect nature areas so that they can be intact and at peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It mainly finances its activities through the sale of holder rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to acquire land from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Bike thieves torment Turku the worst of the major cities - see situation in your municipality of residence
Bicycle thieves torment Turku most of the major cities in Finland.
This year, more bikes have been stolen in proportion to the population than in the other nine major cities.
Helsingin Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles and parts of them stolen per 1,000 inhabitants in the ten largest cities in January to August this year based on bike theft reported to the police.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti also reached the top.
Police reported that four to five bike thefts per 1,000 inhabitants occurred.
In contrast, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Kouvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, in proportion to the population, there are double the number of thefts compared to others," says Tommi Reen, police inspector at the Police Board.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bikes have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be affected by how much you move around the city on wheels and how many bikes you have at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäinen.
Tommi Reen of the Police Board considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to the cities of study and cycling.
Turku has a close centre, short distances and lots of bikes available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a completely different type of city, where urban centres are far apart and a bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of movement," Reen says.
In all of Finland, the police have been informed of slightly fewer bike thefts in January to August than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, police are aware of just over 20,000 bike thefts annually.
That means 50-60 fillars every day and in Helsinki alone about 4,000 bikes per year.
"They're in big numbers," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, as only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen urges people to report a crime for bike theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to police will be solved.
A typical cleared bike theft is one in which police are immediately informed of the theft and the thief is caught in his blood.
"Cases can also be found in other investigations when, for example, there may be stolen wheels in the apartment in a drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly in connection with the act itself or in connection with a police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bikes are stolen from, for example, the bike racks, courtyards, warehouses and bike cellars of shopping centres, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Like previous years, Jopoja is the most stolen from individual bike models.
The U-lock provides better protection for the bike than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale via the internet, for example.
They remain in the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't come to the attention of the police that stolen bikes go abroad a lot," Reen says.
According to police, buyers of stolen bikes are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, as he may commit a concealment offence or violation.
"The alarm bells should ring if a wheel in good condition is sold at a clear underprice," Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special library official, carries his colorful Nopsa to the shelters of the Kallio Library in Helsinki for the duration of his workday.
He has had five wheels, but none have been stolen, Hirvi says. "It's never been taken, there's been a good monk in that way."
"Maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there may not be a hipster value here," the Helsinki-based Moose ponders.
Siiri Valve, who quickly visited the kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, locked her bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now the bike nodded against the kiosk wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into something solid, like a bike rack.
"There will be a lot of thought about it, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I own," a Helsinki student says of his white bike, whose frame alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such rag-Jopojas."
A bike was stolen from the housing company's courtyard a year ago.
The bike was unlocked, so Valve was waiting to usurp it.
Under 15 years old to be held accountable for their crimes?
Helsinki to try peer-to-peer jury familiar from the United States
Helsinki is experimenting with a so-called peer-to-peer jury to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
Initially, the experiment will apply to people under 15 who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer jury intervenes in the first crime committed by a young person.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer jury will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a sanction.
A week later, the offender may join a peer-to-peer jury to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter written for the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio says the model is not tight.
We have other mediation models that are used in parallel.
"All of them are guided in a more responsible direction by the young person's actions so that not everything would be ruined by the first mistake," Laitio says.
The peer-to-peer jury has been modelled on the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not come before the adult panel but reflects on what has happened with about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service designer Iikka Lovio from Palmu, a service design agency that followed the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully investigated.
The first crimes of children under 15 years of age in particular may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message that keep on the path you choose," Lovio says.
The peer jury is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new ways of working are offered to everyone in need, not just immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican influencers want party to stop funding Trump campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it.
The letter is directed at the Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to the Congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and record disfavor, threaten to bring a landslide to Democrats in this election," the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds immediately to the Congressional elections can prevent Republicans from drowning with a Trump-decorated anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are decreasing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is expected to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is Andrew Weinstein, a Republican who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect its majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump's actions that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for U.S. families with children
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told about the details of her economic policy in the United States on Thursday night.
I am running for president so that the U.S. economy will go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
Clinton's plan focuses on a massive, $275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure - roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be partly financed by tax increases for the rich, partly through private money.
The construction program is a hand-hold for American workers who suffer after factories migrate to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in well-paying jobs after World War II.
We are the builder's people, we must return to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to ease the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders anyway, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax refugee, it has to pay the departure tax," Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he used to support.
"[As president], I am against any trade deal that works against employees or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticize the economic program released by Republican Donald Trump on Monday that it "popular only millionaires like this."
Clinton has previously called Trump's loop loop loophole.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small business owner herself.
He reminded listeners of small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making products himself in America," Clinton said.
Such are Rio's ratings: The races have not glued Finns to the screens, but the mobile app is of interest
Usually, sports competitions appear in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have not yet reached a huge number of spectators.
At one time, the races have glued 12 percent of the population to the screens at best: Tuesday night swimming was followed by 615,000 viewers from Yle Olympic channel TV2 at the same time.
By comparison: the European Athletics Championships one month ago attracted nearly 800,000 viewers to TV2, and the European Football Championships well over another million.
So far, the most interesting Olympic sports have been Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the race opened rack gymnastics, both of which reached the Olympic channel at a time by nearly half a million spectators.
Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that viewers are divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympic Games from Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how many TV viewers choose the Olympics at all.
Even on the TV side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has dedicated an entire channel to.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20,000 viewers to 500,000 all that time, that's a good basis.
The number of spectators is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's race broadcasts come at night in Finland.
Another reason for the lame interest - if anyone thinks it is lame now - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some surprise medal from the early races, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, athletics are just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The number of viewers at the beginning has been close to what was expected, according to Pokkinen.
When athletics begins, ratings explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the games, which became the most downloaded free app in Finland in the first days of the games.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd bet we're going around 200,000 downloads now.
"We won't get the online ratings until later.", Pokkinen says
Rio Arena has not worked as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that feedback has been received and the defects have been fixed.
Rio Arena has been associated with a delay and other minor technical problem in the early stages.
Updated versions of the applications have been obtained, which should correct errors.
The Rio Olympics are more widely visible on Yle's channels and arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be followed from Yle Fem, and Yle Speech broadcasts races on radio every day.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most laborious for Yle ever, but also the last to be followed only by Yle channels.
As of 2018, Olympic sports are visible on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which has a depth of 95.3 metres in Risinselkä.
It may be even deeper.
Technology dive trainer Matti Kannela found a press of about 20 square metres on Ristiselkä, the depth of which the diving computer looked 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Institute tried in vain to strengthen the observation by sonaring.
The method may not find a small recess in 100 metres, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Lake Inari (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres extend to Saimaa, Toisvesi and Pääjärvi.
They have not been studied as closely as the Päijänne.
In particular, the bottom of Lake Inari has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela ponders.
If the deepest lake is defined by medium depth, it is Great Lake Yuka, 23 meters.
Looking at this, Päijänne does not get into the top ten and Suvasvesi is even further from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14:29: Corrected last piece with the deepest lakes in average depth wrong.
Ihalainen on tax pay: Pensioners' taxation continues to become more strained
The taxation of pensioners is still more strained than that of wage earners.
Ihalainen says that the grievances came to light in the run-up to parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to wage earners.
The government proposal does not include this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be followed after the election, he says to Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage and salary earners received income reductions that reduced taxation.
The matter heated opposition representatives in Parliament who grilled then-Minister of Finance Alexander Stubb (co.) on election promises.
Purchasing power is secured, it does not grow
According to Ihalainen, the policy presented by Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) on tax cuts is mainly about securing and not increasing purchasing power, as wages will not be increased next year.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen is pleased with Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo's messages about the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement that has been achieved with difficulty.
He says that sticking to a deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action of the government term.
It has been done by labour market organisations, so it should not be ruined by questioning.
It comes in need because the economy depends so much on domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Infectious to prolonged unemployment in a rune
Ihalainen appeals to the government to address long-term unemployment in the budget session, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that unless growth stops, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish casualties reportedly in Thailand attacks
At least four people died in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish tourists intending to cancel their trip to Thailand due to explosions, but it is worth following the embassy's instructions on caution, Westphalen says.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The Finnish travel season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
The majority of tourists from Thailand come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in Hua Hin in particular for information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contact persons in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be going well, Westphalen says.
No information about the author
Westphalen said the perpetrator was not yet known.
The ambassador believes that the events may be related to the political unrest of Thailand's divided society and last week's referendum on the constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were arrested in the country who expressed their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, on the other hand, there is an ethnic-national conflict surrounding the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
In the past, however, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphalen says.
He says that the city celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very low.
The attacks should affect the day's course so that the authorities are very careful about safety.
Thai police: attacks are not about international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been ruled out, Thai police say.
At least four people have died in Thailand in 24 hours after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, popular with tourists.
Even in a tourist destination popular with Finns, four bombs exploded at night on the holiday island Phuket, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current data indicate that they did not claim any casualties.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the paper.
Two bombs also exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded, according to the newspaper.
According to local authorities, a total of four bombs have exploded at a popular tourist destination in Hua Hin yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double bombings.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and the town of Trang in southern Thailand.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar to many tourists, as it is used to travel to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The perpetrator of the attacks is unknown
Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the military junta that controls Thailand, said the perpetrator of the attacks was not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not incite people to panic any more," he told reporters.
Security Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan said at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks were linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators were meant to destroy tourism in the country because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be attentive and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip due to explosions, but it is worth following the instructions of the Grand Tank about caution, Westphalen says.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
There has been a little more information about last night's attack in Hua Hin.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
At least three people were wounded in the latter attack on Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near a bell tower known as an attraction.
Thai PBS reports that police have isolated an area in Hua Hin where it believes it has found one more bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flowerbed, according to the governor of the province.
A municipal employee died in the attack.
There is at least one wounded.
A police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half hour.
The Bangkok Post said the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
US Biles wins women's four-game
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia with a third 58,665 point performance.
Biles, 18, is still pursuing rack championships at the Rio Games with a perm, jump and boom.
Biles has dominated women's gymnastics to the extent of the past few years.
He has eight personal world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the four-match and permno championships three times in a row and the boom last year and the year before.
In the US team, Biles has won two World Team Championships.
The fainter World Cup medals at Biles have jumps and booms.
Thailand's Finnish entrepreneur: "Isku has no impact on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand and a children's play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, then I don't think there will be anything more amazing about this, estimates Huovila, who has worked as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies that have hit Thailand nearby.
There's always something here.
First there was the tsunami, then the avian influenza, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If these previous ones have not expelled tourists, this one is hardly the case either.
The Huovila company office is located a few hundred meters from the site of the explosion.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called at about 9:00 local time and said it was not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the boardwalk and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work as usual this morning.
They thought the roadblocks had been put on for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the shops on the main street were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
Many people on the beach had not even heard of the attacks.
By half past three days, traffic at Patong had normalized and much of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the attack site.
Later, the car in question was seen in Kruunupyy on Jouxholmintie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for description hiding in a nearby six.
The other man was immediately caught.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and aggravated damage to the motor vehicle.
Police thank those who gave the clues.
Research leader on Russia's leadership changes: Clear step aside
Russia made the highest-ranking leader change in years on Friday when President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov, the head of his regime.
Ivanov's successor is Estonian-born 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is an ex-diplomat and served as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's dismissal may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gathering too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership positions is one way of exercising power.
This is a way of preventing people from building up power independent of the president for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in trouble with other leaders or screwed up.
Station drop for Ivanov
Ivanov, who was part of Putin's inner circle, will take on special tasks in environmental and transport matters.
On the tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today said.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, it is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian rule.
Ivanov has also played a significant role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, for example governors, has been replaced in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin is changing his immediate circle to a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields to withdraw in Syria
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus so we wouldn't target them," said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbiji, which is important to ISIS, last week.
However, it is estimated that dozens of jihadists stayed in the city at the time.
Corrected earlier news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously, we falsely reported that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: Ministry of the Interior's document publicity policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public access to documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, Professor of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that document publicity cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to hand over the list of participants in the Interior Minister's events to Ilta-Sanomat.
The Minister justified the decision by the instructions of the Prime Minister's Office and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting material.
The Ministry's Director of Communications tells the STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show begins in Rio
As in recent years, Bolt has run against time under the prestigious games.
He injured his hind thighs in the early part of the season and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic qualifiers.
This hasn't been a complete preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
I have practiced well and that is the key point," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dress samba dancers and journalists who turned into fans.
Around Poria Bolt, underscores that the Jamaican star has risen in an era where athletics has struggled with doping scandals and slipping interest.
Bolt's previous defeat at the Olympic Games came in Athens in 2004, when he was eliminated in the early 200 metres by 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise slowed down by injuries and a loose training attitude.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred metres, with which he crushed the world record and the self-confidence of competitors in the final period of 9.69.
This is harder
A year later, at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt reached his career with a cap on the clock.
The world records of 9.58 hundred metres and 19.19 in Berlin are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is aiming for a 200-meter world record and 19 seconds below, but no one believes it will be created except Bolt himself.
On 100th, Bolt's biggest challenger is Athens' 2004 100th Olympic champion Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has never lost in the finals of the prestigious games since his reign in Beijing, if he has only made it.
In Daegu in 2011, the 100th World Cup final was not run by Bolt due to the start of the fraud.
Bolt will be 30 in just over a week.
He is an old man in the young men's sport, and the Rio Games are his last Olympic Games.
Bolt has set next year's World Cup in London as the final goal line for his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it," Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Rio revelations: two athletes suspected of doping crime
According to Xinhua, China's state news agency, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Traces of banned substances were found in Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi's doping sample.
Bulgarian runner Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was sent to my home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in Rio in the women's 100 metres butterfly.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the International Court of Appeals for Sport CAS.
Xinhua says that a sample given by Xinyi on Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspicions have also emerged in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian female ester Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample showing signs of the epo hormone.
Kenya, on the other hand, has sent an athletics coach home from Rio for doping crime.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday that the Kenyan coach had pretended to be an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample on his behalf.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race pass of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the situation.
Nothing to stop Phelps - historical gold came in show style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swam in a 200-meter mix with his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same sport of Olympic gold in the fourth consecutive games.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino finished second in a mix before Wang Shun of China.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic dating commentator Helen Skelton laughs in the quick interview with Iltalehti.
The story about Helen Skelton (right) on Monday is one of the most read on Iltalehti's website this week.
Next to commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't stress much if there's a little noise in social media or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is visual media, he emphasizes.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short dress that certainly has at least enough revelation - at least for the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, there are no back steps to be taken.
It's important to look good, and little noises are just a fun thing.
Skelton certainly wants to be startled and perhaps startled, but he insists that he does not want to play the lead role.
This is not about me, he says.
We are here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much how I dress.
Can you imagine that the controversy has reached all the way to Finland?
I can't, but anything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers work and how big sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton grins.
You know what?
It's a stir out of nowhere if it comes from wearing (the host).
I'm a little amused if this has hit someone's radar.
Rio police make two arrests for suspected terror
Rio police announced Thursday that they had arrested two people for suspected terrorism.
Police made arrests in connection with security surveillance of the Games.
Police made five other arrests in the same context and questioned two people before they were released.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, people arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by police as early as July.
The detainees are believed to have links to the ISIS extremist organization.
The detainees had reportedly fomented violence on social media.
Messages that urged violence had been distributed on popular WhatsApp, among other things.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of the Rio Games.
Police blow up suspicious package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of Rio basketball tournament match in an empty hall on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball arena and closed the place to the audience.
Police let the audience in after they controlledly blew up the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police have completed a controlled blast mission.
Police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found there.
The audience got in after the police controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not make it to the stands by the start of the match because police closed the arena for a while due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
Police blew up the package and only let the audience in the hall after that.
The drink woke up the Spanish team that started the race sleepily.
Spain, which started the two races with two losses, won Nigeria by 96-87 points.
In the previous two games, Spain reached silver.
Police completed the controlled blast mission for the third time during the Rio Summer Games.
The last time police had to blow up a suspicious discovery near the road cycling finish site was last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria began their first-round game of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty stands.
Argentine lady dressed Petäjä-Siren - Finn pondered protest
Wind Petäjä-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
Wind Petäjä-Siren went through a lot on Thursday.
The Argentine lady dressed Tuuli Petäjä-Siren in Rio on Thursday at the opening start of the women's surfing day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted to the violation.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away," Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius said.
The athlete considered protest for a long time.
It was not worth doing, then, because it would have been useless under the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water to get a refund," Petäjä-Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last because he didn't want to be in Rio's dirty water.
The Finn was left at number 27 with the crash.
In total, the 2012 London Olympic Silver Medalist is the eighth.
The crash had little effect on the tip.
Friday is an important day when you have to race for departures 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things Science Says Extend Your Age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring additional years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his or her life is extended.
Sometimes things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
These include a tendency to medium-body obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can extend the age.
You don't always have to spend a little bit of money just getting a milk can is enough.
Efforts have been made to determine the secret of long life through a variety of studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the strangest research results.
Science says that all of these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee consumption has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a "decreased risk of death," especially in terms of neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol is again advocated by studies that suggest that moderate consumption - one to three daily doses - may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular flossing can prolong a person's life by up to six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents gum infections.
They, on the other hand, can contribute to the onset of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway examined how laughing affected a person's lifespan.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35 percent more likely to live after the experiment ended.
Sex, when protection from sexually transmitted diseases is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
On top of that, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have more years of life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, exercise brings extra years, there is no denying that.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute passage.
A study by Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to lower mortality rates.
Whether it's an athlete who got into medal positions at the Olympics or an actor who won an Oscar, he's more likely to live further than a regular bun.
Many studies have tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will bring extra years into his life.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that long life is due to a person's social status - which in turn allows for the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviour in people over 65 found that a person shopping daily was likely to be less likely to be older than shopping.
This is because spinning in concrete stores reduces loneliness.
It has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may bring death forward.
So, put the credit card down from your hand - online shopping does not have the same effect.
A drunk driver from Umpihuma derailed into a truck
On Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car cam crash took place in Koske, Southwest Finland.
The accident occurred in Koske, between Koskentie and Sorvastontie on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car that came up had drifted into the lane at the same time, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was left standing in its lane after the collision, but caught fire.
The driver managed to put out the fire himself.
The passenger car derailed into the ditch and from then on over the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 carrying a passenger car was squeezed into her car.
The rescue services removed the injured driver from the car and he was transported to Turku University Central Hospital for treatment.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 per mille.
He is suspected of aggravated drunk driving.
Post sends loose candy to the wrong city
Salon K-Citymarket's range of loose candy had shortcomings because the post office had accidentally delivered some of the load to Seinäjoki.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Perniö, was buying loose candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when a funny sign hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in loose sweets because Posti delivered our loads to Seinäjoki!
We'll get more when Posti can deliver the load!
So unless there's traffic in the lawn mowing, the sign said.
The merchant's foxy sign is related to Posti's expansion of its services last spring to include lawn mowing.
The grass cutting is available to Posti until the end of August.
Haltia felt that the sign was mostly amusing and she decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update stunned me.
Media representatives have also been calling all along, and the attention this has attracted is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia's update had over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a loose candy bag, even though a few laari were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the business of Posti's Business Transport Services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanomat.
The background is that three of the five stages strayed into the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to do part-delivery (Saloon) with three, but we only took five stages today," Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanomat.
This was first reported by the Evening Messages.
Teija Haltia was not indignant about the sign because she found all her own loose candy favourites in the selection.
30 pounds of lightened Lotta Backlund released a picture of her change
The comedian producer has slimmed up tens of pounds since the birth of his child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of life change.
Lotta shared a pair of photos of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on a fitness course and aimed for normal weight.
Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss contract as early as 2009.
He has a holistic lifestyle change and slowly lost some thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund released a pair of photos of his soaring performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before and after pair has garnered several commendable comments from fellow dieters.
You're great, though.
We are on the same journey, motivation hard! one exclaims.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Doing It Now project.
I get a lot of strength and enthusiasm from your pictures when I am on the same journey, the other says.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last few pounds on the Let's Do It Now project.
At that time, he told Iltalehti that he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, which was then 10 pounds away.
During the three-month workout, five pounds eventually fell.
Hope of the family of a woman murdered in Loviisa: Remembering the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and petitions with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoo Veterinary Station has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and also completed his nursing training there.
The veterinary clinic recalls the woman with touching words.
Happy, smart, humorous, and fearless of work.
Dear Friend.
Still, we can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs in its entirety, primarily for the purchase of safety vests.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home yard in Koskenkylä, Loviisa.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehti that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and rooster.
The 27-year-old man suspected of murder did not know the woman and had no connection with each other.
The murderer was tracked down by police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
Börje survived and is recovering.
District Court gives Posti a sentence for violating the Non-Discrimination Act
Posti had no right to withhold the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the temporary worker, the Kanta-Häme District Court estimates in its judgment.
The District Court obliged Posti to pay the employee most of the retained salary and 2,000 euros in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Posti could have withheld only part of the employee's salary, which corresponded to the share of induction in the work throughout the day.
According to the District Court, the employee had been placed at a disadvantage in violation of the Non-Discrimination Act on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had followed the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics PAU on the ban on induction.
During last November's postal strike, PAU made a decision that Posti's employees will not familiarise themselves with temporary workers who violate the strike.
This was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey to return to human rights-respecting path
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights-respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter, the Journalists' Union previously asked Sipila and Soini to express their concern for freedom of speech and the press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and expression.
Putin dismisses head of his regime - replaced by Estonian-born Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin reports.
The grandson of Soviet Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino, will be replaced.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, will be involved in specific environmental and transport tasks, according to a Kremlin statement.
Putin said Ivanov had himself asked to be transferred to other positions and proposed Vaino to replace him, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era to spy on the KGB.
Many considered Ivanov a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin's re-election in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant acquisition banned - not seen in Premier League opening
The world record man for football moves is not seen on the field when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban followed England.
Manchester United's giant acquisition Paul Pogba is on the sidelines as ManU opens his league season on Sunday against Bournemouth, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid the Italian club Juventus 105 million euros for Pogba, according to British media.
However, the English Football Association (FA) keeps him out of the game, as Pogba was banned from playing from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season's Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next seam to play is in the league's second round on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, megalomaniacism is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of comfort have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event starring the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festivalgoers have typically expressed themselves with distinctive dress.
One of the artists on the main stage this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
Flow Festival's event area is stylized with artificial turf and art installations, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to have only a main stage and a beer tent," says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
Flow Festival, held in Suvilahti, Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small corttelifestar to an event for tens of thousands of visitors.
The question behind success is simple: What kind of event would the authors like to go to?
In event productions, it is quite different to think so.
Often the goal is to achieve a level of necessity and act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says Tuomas Kallio, Artistic Director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year as well.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to last year by 5,000 people.
This year, the festival will feature a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because you have to fund something in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, which is controlled in huge fairways.
That's not what we want.
Over the course of 13 years, the ideology of a successful event has been inflated so that there are 130 performers, art installations, and numerous restaurant points and drink bars in the partially artificial grass-decorated area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, the venue this year is a tent of 15,000 people.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little megalomaniac, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this is no longer our thing.
For Kallio, the greatest joy and reward for the work done is that even the big visions are practically possible today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operations were very dependent on the City of Helsinki's support of approximately 20,000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the limited liability company operating Flow was approximately EUR 6 million.
It can be used to produce "creise things" like building that 73-meter-wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves in distinctive dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not consciously profiled itself as particularly fashionable.
We want to stand out first and foremost with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow's values: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists on the main stage is tick legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his own genre, but he is not the most typical performer at the festival combining indierock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time this will be seen at a gig in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's being played on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's done some damn good gigs in recent years.
Thai tourist paradise bombs hidden in flower pots - tourists fled in horror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower pot and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran said.
Since 1989, Edwin Wiek, a protector of wildlife living in Asia, tweeted a eloquent picture of the attacks.
If the tweet doesn't show properly, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran up to me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the largest bar streets, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Thani.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after, two bombs exploded on Phuket Island, which is also popular with Finns.
No one reportedly died.
Meanwhile, another double bomb attack was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet exploded.
Thai officials say that the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organisations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet said police have recently been taking a lot of action by criminal organizations engaged in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new readiness forces will go into battle first in a war situation
In an acute war situation, conscripts are not ordered to take up combat missions until several months after the military oath is taken, according to Keskisuomalainen.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonninen, the Defence Forces training manager interviewed by the newspaper, for example, only those who are in the final stages of their training are eligible for combat in a war situation for 5.5 months.
According to the chief of education, the service is first assigned to the reservists of the emergency forces.
No conscripts or reservists are assigned to a task that has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer, it became apparent that the Defence Forces will start training conscripts in immediate readiness units from next year.
Units can be used in military operations even during military training if necessary.
Pamela Tola received giant compensation for the mold house
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of the two-storey detached house had been 330,000 euros.
However, after trading, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in demolition condition in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss for Tola and Waroma amounted to as much as EUR 198,000.
The couple took the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and court of appeal.
The court ruled on Wednesday.
It upheld the district court's ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 in price reduction.
In addition, the seller has to reimburse the couple's legal and settlement costs for a total of EUR 47,344.
The right moderated the price reduction slightly, because some need for repair of the apartment had already been known to buyers when the housing transaction was being made.
However, according to the Court of Appeal, the obvious building errors were substantially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola was looking for a home in good condition
Tola told the Court of Appeal that the couple had specifically been looking for a home in good condition because they did not want to take up any repairs.
He had the idea that the building was renovated and in good condition and that the issues mentioned in the condition inspection report were not detrimental.
The fitness inspection report mentioned ventilation as risks and grievances and the lack of adequate control of rain and meltwaters running along the rocky surface.
However, the discussions did not indicate that this was an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained in the notion that rainwater from the rock should perhaps be slightly controlled within a few years.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the moisture problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
Inspections in 2012 and 2013 found microbial growth in the building, which, according to witnesses, was due to both rock rainwater and capillary soil moisture.
On the west side of the house, microbial-polluted air could also be reached indoors through the porch, according to the inspector.
Mold or yeast that allows for health risk and exceeds the limits were found in brush samples in the utility room, basement staircase, living room window bay, and basement washroom.
Terraces were built without permits
The court also debated whether the apartment had been expanded in violation of the building permit.
The court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the City of Espoo's decision that changes had been made to the apartment in violation of the permit before the transaction.
The terraces, among other things, had been built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in court.
According to the Court of Appeal, buyers could assume, on the basis of the information they received from the seller before the transaction, that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
The Court of Appeal did not consider that Tola and Waroma had any particular reason to carry out a more extensive inspection than usual.
Buyers have not failed to comply with their duty to report, the Court of Appeal states in its judgment.
Creepy archive discovery: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how a total of 218,500 women have been stored on microfilms in the U.S. National Archives in Maryland, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi brides.
The documents and registration cards come from the Race Agency in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency operated under SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said gynecological studies were conducted on women to investigate the issue.
The breed office investigated women's backgrounds, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family tree.
Women were also to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the breed agency handwritten biographies and good recommendations from loved ones.
The breed agency wanted guarantees that women were "child lovers", "sparate", and "good National Socialists" who knew German well.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides of SS men.
The story does not say what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born out of wedlock and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, the website of the U.S. Holocaust Museum reports.
Instead, Nazi population politics focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for having children.
The German mother's honorary cross was awarded to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "Non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, the museum's website states.
On the sixth of Petäjä-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first departure of Finnjollie Day at the Rio Olympic Games, but remained the tail of the whole group at the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose eighth in the overall situation after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to number 14.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought in RS:X class day departures at 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren were ranked 23rd in the opening start of the day.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are ranked 19th.
Jari Sillanpää's Fairy Talelinna was recorded for a couple of hours a night's sleep: "I was so stiff"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite artists of Finns for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's bartender to the 1995 tango king, the best-selling solo artist in Finland, and the star of dance stages and festivals, Sillanpää is still able to bounce and she is currently in a wild lift.
Jari Sillanpää, a book written by Mari Koppinen about the life of a favorite singer - Paljaana was published today on Thursday.
In the book, Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
Sillanpää's career rose to total rise as he won the tango king's crown in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang bars, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango song for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The Satulinna song became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The bridgehead sang it on tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so stiff!
The bridgehead remembers in the book.
Recording a song that has become a huge hit would not immediately guess that it has been sung in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to demand the perfect and the top of yourself all the time.
Another coincidence surrounding the man's most popular paragraphs, as reported in the book, occurred nearly twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from his then partner and the case eventually ended up with texts from You Earn Gold, which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the song words ordered from Saara Törmäs were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
The bridgehead had imagined himself to be making a record that tells the true story of his own life, but the words in the song about the breakup were not true, but were written based on the news in the 7 Days magazine.
The newspaper's news reported that Jari and his ex-loving divorce were caused by Jari's excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a complete bunny and was not true.
Jari, according to the book, played furiously at the label and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdoms out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters supported the gap and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls on the voting week anticipate the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a couple of individual researchers dared to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme phrase of former US President Bill Clinton's recent election campaign "It's the economy, stupid" flew into the scrap booth in Britain's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Economic Curly Language
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics takes answers from the profession to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not listened to because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists for the loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in employment, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right brit.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
The economists felt that voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly critical of the BBC's equity, which gave as much room to only a couple of percent of economists representing the EU's withdrawal as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic power letter combinations think of the consequences of the difference.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke face to face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt, and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both listened to and understood, they were ignored because economists represent an elite with whom voters do not, in their own opinion, share common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is also an economy
The overwhelming winning argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will congeste your hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each café has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would a British person get medical appointments if they didn't exist?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would real British children get a place to go to school if they were eliminated?
There are foreigners living in each municipality.
How much more room would the natives have if they took off?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their responses did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centre queues and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund prepares for Brexit in cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are carried out by Pertti Vanhanen from Finland.
He said Aberdeen was preparing for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or a camp in favour of an EU withdrawal, began to be prepared for more detail a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a leave.
There was concern that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large liquid assets, but now they could be necessary.
We went on to increase cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily real estate fund, which was affected by the news.
According to Vanhanen, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all open real estate funds in the UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was ten percent or even below.
Real estate funds therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
Funds shut down trade
When the camp that supported the EU's withdrawal won, Europe got confused.
However, the less than two weeks following the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trade.
These together robbed the situation and put the matter in the main headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good due to the cash raised, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to Vanhanen, they did not actually close trading, but changed pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether it is now worth withdrawing the money in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of it canceled the ad.
Since then, it has been quite steady, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks, Vanhanen says.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar turmoil in Aberdeen's continental European funds.
However, there were many surveys.
Unreasonably attention to real estate funds
Vanhanen felt that the closures of real estate fund trading received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds that were affected by the closures control about 4% of British real estate.
Aberdeen's shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 of its London-based properties.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold on to its fund in 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been swirling downwards, but the situation does not look more "loose" for Aberdeen.
The biggest issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even brought new opportunities to some real estate investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar exchange rate is at its weakest in 30 years, and there is also 15% sales in the market compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are many willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought negatives to London real estate market
At 2:00 a.m., things didn't look very much like that yet.
But at four o'clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, who is responsible for real estate investments at the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to see the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
The power word was in it.
I realized that this is going to the side of plan B now, Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He headed to work immediately.
The City of London was already fully alive despite the morning.
The TV screens, which were normally set to be silent at the office, filled the news, and usually the loud people were completely silenced to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell of his breakup.
When the market opened, the display terminals flashed only red.
It was a morning you never thought you would live, Vanhanen says.
Not because, despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of Britain's largest real estate funds, completed two real estate transactions the day after the Brexit vote, or as a Midsummer.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the company had prepared well for the option, and therefore the situation was kind of calm, Vanhanen says.
Brexit vote begins repair movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership went into exchange.
The market began to anticipate drastic declines in the UK real estate market, and especially in London.
London office premises were anticipated to have up to 20% minuses in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began freezing their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the storm has subsided, but uncertainty is still rife in the air.
It does not appear on the face of Vanhanen, who spent his last summer holidays in Helsinki this week.
It is still far too early to say much about what will happen with Brexit.
So much remains open: how the difference will occur and how Scotland will react to the situation, for example.
First information on the development of the London real estate market has already been obtained.
The data of CBRE, a real estate service company, on price developments cover about one third of the market.
According to them, prices for all properties in London fell by 3.3% from June to July.
The London City office buildings accumulated 6.1% of the minus, Vanhanen lists.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have there been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All the equally large drops hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting because Brexit was compared quite quickly to Lehman's fall and the global economic crisis that began in the US real estate market.
Vanhanen feels that the comparison is not quite apt, as this is a domestic crisis in Britain.
The atmosphere is different.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales like that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, Vanhanen says.
Funding is also found normally.
The repair shop could have been ahead anyway.
In fact, he thinks the price correction movement is no wonder - that could have been the case without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of properties in London and other world's number one cities have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City, and especially the offices, are overpriced," Vanhanen says.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, Vanhanen lists.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last category of ownership that is becoming globalized, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment targets abroad.
London is an easy destination as a well-known city.
In addition, prices have been fed by low interest rates, which have forced pension companies, for example, to look for returns on new targets.
On top of this, the loan has been readily available - although according to Vanhanen, the leverage has now been used clearly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price increases levelled off last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten its holdings in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of turn of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He does not dare to judge much in the future, but says that no upswing is expected.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or steady going ahead.
Vanhanen has already seen more stores up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can get through the pits with work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in one market, you are too much of a victim of it.
If you have decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, Vanhanen says.
S Group begins to register shopping data more accurately than before
Soon S Group will know what you are eating, as the trading group said today that it is starting to collect more detailed information about its regular customers' purchases.
So far, after data has been collected on the total amount of receipt, the group will start to collect it from the purchased products in early May.
S Group will follow Kesko here, as the data on goods purchased with plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the customer's consent and is used for marketing under permission.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Taloussanomat.
He said Kesko would not react to the S Group's registration change.
Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups according to food purchases alone.
The classification is updated monthly.
Loyalty customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data is only collected from K Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not disclose their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a loyalty program and there is no such program planned for the time being.
Suomen Lähikauppa has its own 1st Bonus loyalty program, which can be joined by Valintatalot, Siwoi and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product groups, we will remain at the level of the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made in and on what day and the customer receipt total.
We haven't gone to that level like Group K or Group S," says Commercial Director Anu Ora.
He said the loyalty program was to be renewed in the future, but Lähikauppa will tell about it later.
However, Ora does not promise that product information will be registered.
Initially, the experiment
SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive so far.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information has also included occupation, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal data.
People in the same household and their role are also registered.
The S-Front Card Purchase stores the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and payment method.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners is obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodi Terros and ABC chains, data is recorded at the product group level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely," says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Owner and Partner Operations at SOK.
S Group says it will inform its customers of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, the data is stored in bags anyway, whether you like it or not.
The willing person can check their stored data on the S Group's website.
For example, cashiers cannot access the data, emphasises Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-puppy is Customs' latest dog reinforcement - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black Labrador retriever puppy vigorously sniffs five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits resolutely next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog playing it with his favorite toy.
The box that Heila sat next to revealed a jar of shell casings that burst into gunpowder gas.
Gunpowder gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and online store main reasons
Heila is Customs' first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The Paris and Brussels attacks caused measures at Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
Another main reason for training a gun and explosive dog in Customs' duties is mail via Helsinki Airport.
With the increased internet trade, up to 40 million mails pass through the airport each year, including weapons supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made an online store at Helsinki Airport from shopping, passenger plane baggage and air cargo to about 300 finds related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives, and their starting materials.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate checked baggage and mail.
In ports, it will have a big benefit in the future as it can go through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on Heila's performance, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
School in Kirkkonummi
The training of the Heila puppy is coordinated by the Customs Dog School in Kirkkonummi.
Suntio also goes to training with Heila with police and Defence Forces experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
Heila is always trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tulli's six drug dogs and the money and drug dog Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from the litter of ten puppies.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include briskness and hunting instinct, as well as calmness, because the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion's home, is a close co-worker for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
You can't get anywhere without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
Subtle orders go to Heila for a one-time cap.
The cameraman of Ilta-Sanomat loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila returns a cover that looks like a soft toy immediately from the "detach" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which will assess whether the training is sufficient for demanding jobs.
Heila can be seen in work tasks at Helsinki Airport next year if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and iron the dog on top of the work vest, Suntio reminds.
The cost of one working dog is approximately 60,000-70000 euros per year for Customs.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working hours only last from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
The owner of working dogs is a fierce competition at Customs.
Heila was acquired by about 20-30 Customs employees.
Happiness hit Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and surveillance duties at Customs.
Mini-state gets first Olympic medal - people get day off
The Olympic gold medal in Fiji, with a population of less than one million, is so highly valued in the country that the government has designated August 22 as the national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian government confirmed the issue after the championship was decided.
The day off is held the day after the team returns home.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
Fiji rugby team celebrated the championship.
The Guardian reports that the country followed the finals in the capital Suva, where a screen had been erected at the stadium.
Normally, only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage," Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru told the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish buyer fainted after a wild performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt from 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a peculiar and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
Tokola received 175 pounds from the push in Rio and 145 pounds from the rapture.
His combined score was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his push in the last 175 pounds, as well as in the second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose accompanied by wild roaring.
The body trembled under the weights until the jury approved the withdrawal.
The joy of the Finnish buyer was accompanied by the fact that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Estonian striker Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Club, which plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting contract with Estonian nodder Albert Prosa until the end of the season.
We are looking for a top player with power for our team and a small threshold for coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
With over ten player agents, we went through over 50 players from around the world.
Slowly, Prosa began to stand out as a good alternative," RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a statement.
Prosa, 25, arrives at RoPS from Flora from Tallinn, where she scored 51 goals in 109 games.
He has also played for the Estonian national team.
Prosa is scheduled to be with RoPS as early as Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovanieme people will meet the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS was needed for a new attacker when last season's goal king Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Dead Modern Family star shrugs again: teen star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became familiar with the modern Family comedy series as Alex Dunphy, is once again blazing by introducing her voluptuous body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also his butt.
Winter, 18, has recently attracted attention by making her style and behavior much bolder.
The star has posed in her social media photos in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very scarce outfits.
Winter, on the eve of adulthood, has also recently released several pictures of itself celebrating.
If the picture is not visible, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public image so radically.
At this time, Amy Palmer, founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a child star to an adult.
He has been on television for almost his entire life and has grown up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more you show the bare surface, the more publicity and attention you get in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignant some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where she'll be in ten years, when the downhill is already so hard," one woman said on Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and urge him not to care about criticism.
You look great!
No matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, anneals a young woman.
Japanese prefer Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are lured in the Northern Lights: In autumn it is possible to see a fairytale mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract Japanese people to start Northern Lights trips already in early autumn, Visit Finland says in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese Northern Lights tourism are Inari and Levi.
Northern lights are the trump cards of our winter tourism and are strongly associated with heart winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a great demand for winter Northern Lights trips in Lapland, but we are now trying to increase sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the Northern Lights season starts early in autumn and continues well into spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the northern lights, making the vision two times fairytale," says Anne Lind, Acting Marketing Manager at Visit Finland.
The main target group of Visit Finland's Northern Lights campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey conducted by researchers from Aalto University and the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive country image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and this is where the Northern Lights have huge potential, according to Lind.
Overnight stays by Japanese tourists have grown clearly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they stayed more than twice as much in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group, as they spent over 80 million euros in Finland.
On average, Japanese people spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to settle for silver in rugby-7 when Fiji champion team won gold
The impressive success of the UK in the seven-player rugby race was shattered when Fiji won it on Thursday in the finals played at Rio Deodoro Stadium in chapters 43 to 8.
Fiji taught the champions in ball handling, moves, side hallucinations, support game, running lines and raw power, thus winning gold — if it was the first Olympic medal in all its history for the country.
The loss meant silver, which was a slightly more thin comfort for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as an Olympic sport in the first rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The tight win from the Boxes in South Africa in numbers 7 to 5 in the semi-finals earlier that day may have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, Fiji's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-person team had been in full force.
What may bring comfort to the UK is that at least one British will be awarded a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, a former English rugby-7 coach from Wimbledon.
The experience has been quite great for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in Ryan's coaching at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The loss hurts, but the progress is startling.
Fiji started off excellently and presented his tackle skills to the UK as if for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had come across a number of moving buses, and the world champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisau made a dive to the corner.
When it was four minutes on the clock, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal on the right side of the goal kick.
Situation 12-0, and Great Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's stunning tackle prevented the rocky Leone Nakarawa from scoring a third goal, but it didn't slow Fiji down for long.
After seven minutes of playing the game, Jasa Veremalua scored at the right angle, after which the UK was 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored a second goal on the follow-up start, leaving more than a minute left in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then crashed through the UK team's even more powerless tackles and crashed over the finish line.
After the goal kick, the opening period ended 29-0.
It seemed that Fijians were born to play seven-player rugby, while the British are still in the role of an apprentice in the sport.
Which is largely true.
The UK made large-scale changes in halftime and managed to hold back Fijians for a whole four minutes, which compared to the first half was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova scored thanks to an excellent team game for the Fijians.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation by 36 to 10 by scoring the UK at the left corner, but the game had long since been lost to the South Sea archipelagoers, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
Fiji's pure joyous attitude was hard not to admire.
Mata Viliame made the final touch of the Fijian cake by scoring at the last moments.
The whistle rang, the Fijians embraced each other, and the British fell on the field, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had won the Japanese semi-finals by 20 to 5 and the UK had shriveled past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was resolved by the UK goal kick.
Kyle Brown took the South African Boxes to the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling footwork and crashed under the goalposts in the second half.
Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-player rugby team player Anthony Watson, sealed the win and eventually the silver medal.
Coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to row gold
This could not be more emotional than gold in these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning rowed 220 winning bets into history and found an additional purpose for their golden moment in Estacio da Lagoa.
Although the two were in the oars, the third voice of coach Robin Williams echoed in the boat, encouraging them to have their second consecutive Olympic gold medal in the women's duo, making them the first women in the history of British sports to achieve a similar achievement.
Their superiority was undeniable, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, two brilliant athletes connecting on the water surface like swans to age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each rowing gold is a large number of helping hands, each of which has contributed to the two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, who 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and then did not know if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes the way of thinking a little."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the season in early 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if you can even say so now under conditions like this.
"I needed money, so I had to get better quickly.
It served as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
Rowing itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the two's thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal trying to overcome his own unrest.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artillery Regiment, who had a tour of Afghanistan behind him, says, "At the emotional level I've been in ruins this week, which is perhaps a little extreme, but it means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
For the past three years, Helen and Robin's cashiers have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in the last five years.
The two have found an overwhelming rhythm that their competitors have failed to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, as the New Zealand and Danish twos began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very caught up in an instant.
Helen kept saying, "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to get off the route."
"We were very happy to leave, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything amazing.
We didn't reach for the heavens today, we just wanted to make a good row and win the race we did."
The two think for a year before deciding their future.
Glover celebrates his wedding next month with Steve Backshall, known for television nature shows
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"It took me about six months after London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time it took about four minutes to realize.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland to trade Panama leak-wrinkled government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which were claimed by protesters infuriated by the Panama leaks as early as the spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that several Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned due to the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on October 29.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the people's last spring's rage will affect the autumn election result.
In June, the presidential election clearly showed criticality towards those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was nominated outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was ISIS founder
US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest controversy.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that sitting President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organization ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clintonk was involved in the organization's founding.
The Democratic Party was outraged by the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
No one should ever be allowed to be the commander-in-chief of the army who can sink that low," Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the Muslim-favored covering of burkini swimsuits on beaches, according to the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone without a swimsuit that respects good practice and secularism.
The decision also says that swimwear that grandiosely expresses religious affiliations can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating French National Day.
In late July, two men connected to the extremist organization ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
Quality of bathing waters in the Oulu region passed the sieve - In Pyykösjärvi blue-green algae seam
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements set for bathing water.
Only blue-green algae opacity has been observed on the shore of Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Region Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Apart from Meriniemi beach, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters of bathing areas undercut the action limits set in the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health regulations.
The levels of E.coli and enterococcals in the water at Meriniemi beach were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green algae opacity observed at the Pyykösjärvi beach does not yet make the water unswimmable, but under favorable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green algae blooms, forming blue-green algae mass on the water surface in ferries.
The environmental action monitors the situation through increased inspections.
If blue-green algae opacity turns into blue-green algae blooms, this is also announced separately on the bathing area bulletin board.
See the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside
The forest gift deduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal for next year.
A tax deduction is proposed for the Income Tax Act, which would be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the generational change in forest space.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest farm size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the clean capital income of forestry.
The idea of making such a tool to promote generational changes in forest farms is good, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Director of Forests at the Confederation of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Hakkarainen finds something to criticize in the tax change proposal.
The forest gift reduction is proposed to be made from the clean capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income minus all other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen felt that the impact of the tax deduction would be greater if the deduction could be made directly from the sales income of wood.
The VM proposal assumes that by making a reduction in the clean capital income of forestry, it will prevent a loss in the capital income of forestry that would be deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would receive a tax benefit even if no wood was sold.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to perceive it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says, the model only applies to a small number of forest owners.
The tax deduction limit tied to the forest's yield value is 40,000 euros in the proposal.
It is too high for Hakkarainen.
As such, it will cut 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners out of the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of forest ownership, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the space.
In forest policy, the forest gift reduction has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
It is based on the ageing of the forest owner.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
Strong hail surprised motorists at Himanga - two cars derailed into a ditch and collided with each other
There was a special chase in Himanga, Kalajoki, on Friday morning.
According to the rescue services, two cars that drove in a row were derailed into a ditch, after which the one who came in the back collided after what was ahead.

There were two people in the car behind them, both of whom were transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more detailed information about their injuries.
The driver of the car ahead was not injured.
The accident occurred on Highway 8 from Himanga, a few kilometers towards the Kalajoki River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results by researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments to be more effective.
Observations by Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska's research group show that the hardness of a cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue around the cancer to match normal, soft tissue.
In the future, it may be possible to improve the effectiveness of cancer drug treatments by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family home killing continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for another perpetrator as well
The threshing of Muhos' family home killing continues at court for both of the convicted.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home killing at Muhos.
One received 8 years for 4 months for manslaughter and aggravated robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second is 12 years in prison for murder and aggravated robbery as a young person.
The person convicted of manslaughter was also convicted of aggravated endangering road safety as a young person and of transporting the vehicle without justification as a young person.
The district court's verdict was appealed by the prosecutor, plaintiffs and a man who was sentenced to a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man who has been punished with less severe punishment be sentenced to 12 years in prison for murder as a young person.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the District Court, 17-year-old youths killed a man who worked as director of the child welfare unit at the school home in July last year.
The 17-year-old convicted of murder attacked a director sitting on the living room couch from behind, according to the convictions.
The director had gotten off the grip and led the young person to his room, when one of the young people hit him with a vacuum cleaner tube.
The director was also strangled under the leadership, hit and kicked in the head.
According to a mental examination, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
The court said the young people had planned to escape from the family home at least since the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest vertebrate in the world, only increasing at 156
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed as an ice shark, according to a study published in Science magazine.
The ice shark, or holker, that swims around Greenland in the northern Atlantic can live up to 400 years.
The female does not increase until she is 156 years old.
The lifespan of an ice shark is increased by the fact that it grows by only a centimeter per year.
Only one species of clam is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age with radiocarbon dating.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The age of the oldest was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - People's News
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world.
Up to a third of all government tax revenue would not be received if the change to corporate tax advocated by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenue would also decrease, especially with tax breaks that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a really staggering amount left uncollected, $1,000 billion a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump's 33th discount.
The inheritance tax would be waived altogether.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of business and bankrupting small businesses.
The decided environmental standards of the emergencies must be re-established and the regulation of the energy sector dismantled.
Barack Obama's health care reform must be re-examined.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, "suffering" trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems in the United States.
Free trade agreements would be dissociated.
Imports from China would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and from Mexico to a 35% penalty tax.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our creed," Trump said.
Donald Trump's America doesn't need any other world:
American cars will drive the streets, American planes will connect cities, American ships to control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers throughout the country.
Unlike his ways, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by assistants, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - see Trump's program take the United States into a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton announced her own show early Friday in Finnish time.
A wave of attacks from the past - People's News
The sea is fatal, but the actual tidal wave strikes in the middle of Madrid's street bustle - reckoning with the past can begin.
It summarizes the essence of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous directing work Travel Lovers (2013) was a little fun and ronsky satirical comedy, the skin I live in (2011) tops of a Spanish career.
On a level, Julieta (2016) is set somewhere between those two works.
It is a conventionally serene love, relationship, and family drama, centered on the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is simple and is seen as a long flashback.
Life seems to be in its model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of the occasional encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is allowed to be amazed all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a flashback and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moments when she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, becomes the second female lead, a TV acquaintance from the series The Time Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a blunder, but I would say it's pretty clever and literally a one-time wipe.
Almodóvar films often have such characteristic flashiness, down to humor, there is a fair distance in Julieta.
It is a equally heavily played, restrained, place in some places a film with good music and quite sad, with elements for elegance as such.
Instead, the visual saturation typical of the Spanish director is still present and gradually begins to be injected into the eye as a pure form rather than a functional dramatic power.
People in the film are affected by illnesses, deaths, or otherwise just sudden losses, but the surface remains equally Korean.
This is especially true for costumes: in the case of a name person, the outfits change from one scene to another, and the same is true for spectacular earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, that is, the tunings of the scene in question, does not particularly improve from this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and little lifeless.
Almodóvar has written a script based on three short stories by the Nobel Prize-winning Canadian Alice Munro.
The short stories are published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat even-thick literary film.
The ingredients would have been emotionally incomparably more robust drama, that much big things - especially the gnawing guilt - the theme of the film deals with.
Directed and written by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three short stories by Alice Munro.
Starring Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The film premieres on 12 August.
Government tries election gimmick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, saying ministers, so that the Finns Party will not collapse completely.
However, cuts decided in the spring are made with a lot of crap.
There will be no new cuts.
The four billion savings already decided are enough.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (co.) assert under the budget session.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, because the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring spending limits session.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits tied to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of earnings-related unemployment security will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
The municipal elections haunt
Why do ministers stress so much that no further cuts are made on these?
Because next year will be an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the main thermometer of the parliamentary term, not polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal election result, which takes the government parties in different directions, will ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
However, Gallups report that the Government Party of the Finns Party is facing a ruffle defeat, although the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns Party received 752 new delegates, most of whom will be realized next spring by the price of influencing the right-wing government.
The lifeline of three governments of about equal parties depends on the Finns Party's cant to endure.
It has not lasted now, but more than half of those who voted for the party had enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visitation have also come to the surface.
First, the new cuts will not come is obscured by the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, attempts will be made to soften the attack that awaits the Finns Party.
Major cuts in 2018?
In a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The government has set itself the goal of folding debt during this parliamentary term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take in €5.9 billion next year, more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands as early as the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: debt does not fold or even slow down.
The other is to stick to the program.
That means new even tougher cuts in the 2017 budget session.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring, what comes will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
These actions did not break the debt
It is quite clear that with the current measures, debt will not be reversed, no matter how much Juha Sipilä tries to incite a positive mood.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäki at the budget briefing prove it irrefutable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved overly optimistic, i.e. there will be no traction aid from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has hardly risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and prolonged from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs more than EUR 3 billion per year than in 2008.
On the curves presented by Hetemäki, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt stimulus presented by the Left Alliance was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about six billion euros, which will be covered in practice by taking on a whole new debt.
This is the concept of what is responsible for the centre, the Coalition Party and the Finns Party.
Survey: Municipalities want to be left with a lot of tasks
Three out of four believe that the organisation of day care, youth work and physical activity for children is the responsibility of the municipality, according to a study by the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the population also rolls responsibility to an individual municipality for libraries, culture, civic colleges, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
The county, on the other hand, is most clearly responsible for regional planning, specialised medical care, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
None of the tasks under the authority of the municipalities are to be transferred to the state.
Minor drunk driver ran away from police at the end of the chase
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu drove away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie on Friday night at half past one.
A police patrol tried to stop a motorcycle without lights, but the young man set out to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The chase continued to Sonkajanrantatie, from where further to Sorronahontie and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drifted out of the road.
Even after this, the young man ran away, but the faster-footed police ran to the fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 per mille.
He also did not have a driver's license that justified riding a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, among other things, as a gross endangerment of road safety.
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch
A truck in a stone cargo fell into a ditch in Polvijärvi on Kaavintie on Thursday night at 9:15 p.m.
The truck had drifted out of the road in a bend curved to the left and fell on its side into a ditch.
The rescue department lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter personnel and paramedics.
Lifting the vehicle was left to the car owner.
The fallen truck poured hydraulic oil into the road, which the rescue department absorbed into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon in Ilmajoki
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahdenkylä, Ilmajoki, South Ostrobothnia.
Police are looking for a woman who is about 165 centimeters tall, slim and well-bred and has white hair that extends under her jaw.
Observations and clues about the lost movements are asked to call the Ostrobothnian Situation Centre tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of a major accident in the air - see the photo gallery of Parafest's devastation
The downward flow that brought down the tents of the Parafest festivals caused extensive damage.
Arto Pepperi, president of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be financially on its feet, and the event can also be held next year.
Parafest's last performer, Kalle Salonen, performed on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the programme will continue with performances at the City Theatre premises from 1 p.m.
The Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program is organized as planned.
The surge flow is generated in the thunderstorm when rainwater and its weight trigger a descending airflow.
Changes in the state of the water in the thunder cloud bind heat, and thus the descending air mass cools and its pace towards the earth accelerates.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that several downward currents occur in Finland during the summer.
The route of surge currents is difficult to predict.
The crash flow struck the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, which was the venue for Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents fell down, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
There was one child among them who was transported to further care with mild injury.
Air pollution ages Londoners
The study found that Londoners' skin ages faster than usual.
The reason for the skin's aging is air pollution.
The British study is reported by the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed the most toxic fine particles in London without and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than, for example, an elderly person living in rural areas.
Skin ageing fine particles are very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have found that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
A study by Cac found that early aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who travel their commutes walking near congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution with various masks, for example, but regular skin cleansing is recommended as a more practical solution.
Tractor brakes failed... pushed the man standing in front
The man had moved rocks in his yard by tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to visit in front of it, the tractor brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man was not hit by it, but the tractor was able to push the man enough to be transported to the central hospital for further investigation seriously injured.
The tractor did not have time to drain further, as it collided with the stones in front.
Riento with new strength for the upcoming season
League Riento, who plays in the Volleyball Championship, will start the series from a better starting point than in memory in October.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common note is certainly better found than in previous seasons, when the beginnings of the series have been dark for Rienno.
Jani Säisä, who continues as Rienno's head coach, praises the new team as enterprising and united.
Fred Musoni, the middle anti-combat from the foreign trio, begins his second term in Rienno.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who performed for Rwanda's national team, is a 205-cent chipper.
Garchet is a passer, respectively, a Brazilian has a measure of 198 cents.
Through Josba, Kataja and the River Boys to the US national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all floorball World Championships since 2003.
Now there are already sixth races in Tampere, only 2013 missed after Canada was better at North American qualifiers.
I worked in Turku and played with women there when I noticed the announcement.
The US was setting up a floorball national team.
I was interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was a year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, such a sport was not yet played at the SM level as floorball.
The sparkle was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later hockey in Jokipoji in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played floorball SM-series with the university during the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Josba.
Along with playing, he coached the club's A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM-series career culminated in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played 10 seasons in the women's SM series, with a balance of 51+34=85 in 169 games.
The latest SM-season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen named to the national team
Perttu Puska, who raised the Joensuu-based floorball club Josban, and the Eno-based Tatu Väänänen were selected to join the Finnish national team, who will play for the Czech Brno EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
Perttu Puska, who is attacking the Helsinki-based Lot, has played six men's national games before this, where he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 power points.
Swiss Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the femur and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 national matches experience.
Mika Kohonen, a veteran of Seinäjoki Gaming Brothers, was also named to the national team, who was last seen in the Finland shirt at the World Cup last December.
Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti is the head coach of the Finnish Floorball team.
Beach volley artist Essi Hasu's circle closes in Kouvola - SM-gold missing from prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to quit as a beach volley player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals are played in both adult and youth series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the top six pairs in each series ranking are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who was raised by Elimäki YMCA and has been among the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Hasu, who lives in Helsinki today, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
Hopefully as many people as possible will be able to go to the stands this weekend.
I'm sure there's a fine arena coming to the nesting stadium.
I haven't played in the adult leagues very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, Hasu said.
The Kouvola region sparked Hasu's spark for sports and gave good snacks for a great hobby.
There are very memories of childhood in mind.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in Elimäki's YMCA E-girls.
At the top of the mind is too big a jersey, knee pads on the ankles, and amazing ace screams and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small town, the sports club was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were heavily involved - we were coached by the teammate's father and our mother was the club's president for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural species choice to counterbalance indoor volleyball during junior season.
A song has been played at the beach since the 1990s.
At the toilet, the activity has always been active.
I also went to see the juniors' SM tour races myself, thinking that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays with Anniina Parkkinen from Pieksämäki this weekend in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtonen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the two ranked second in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM-gold we still lack in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last one in front of a familiar audience for Hasu.
In early September, new challenges in civilian work await.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
The toe slippers are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Salomon Koli boldly became an agricultural entrepreneur
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk-taking, sweat and vigor.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
Soon two years ago, Koli, along with his younger brother Valtteri Koli, began working as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises the brothers with his own experience.
Starting as a rural entrepreneur meant debt and increasing the size of the farm so that the bread could come into hand from agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I have always loved doing things on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I have put everything on the line.
If you start something, I think you have to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a yard barn, and at first the bank was not enthusiastic about it either.
However, I myself really boldly joined the project and have been fully involved in it, Salomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he did not have faith in producing clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out to be good.
Salomon Koli, who grows meat trucks, aims to invest in an even bigger barn.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the Young Food Producer competition of Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for first time in eight months

The average annual inflation measured by CPI over the past 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 percentage compared to December 2015%) has been -0.2%, with annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 being -0.2%.

Snapchat anime effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that the filter was inspired by anime, but some observers think it's racist.
Snapchat's lens tool allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identity in ways that bring absurdity closer together.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are unvarnished, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All missteps quickly come to the public attention.
Snapchat lenses have received criticism, where it has been accused of favoring blackface makeup or bleached skin tones as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered some of its users a filter this week that turned their eyes crooked, distorted teeth, and made cheeks plump, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts suggest a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday, including online releases The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some vehemently denied the anime parable.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweet about the images was widely distributed, said in an email that the lens was "at least offensive and embarrassing."
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the paralleling of a very tasteless Asian caricature with filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but a one taken to a degrading extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that must avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, there seems to be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's general audience consists of young people who are more diverse in ethnic backgrounds than their older counterparts. This may mean they are likely to expect more discretion.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, these types of things no longer go unnoticed very easily, as they did before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as a product manager and designer on the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article and telephone interview published in Medium, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mostly white and men-only leadership and concluded his writing with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no people of color in their one-sided staff, allowing them to make decisions like this, or they also have colored ones as employees, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinions directly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, citing its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of its staff, but its spokesperson said the company had recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented groups of people and to promote inclusion within the company.
For his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say this is not OK."
Congressional expert group says military officials misrepresented intelligence on ISIS
A Congressional team of experts released a report Thursday that officials from the United States Armed Forces, the Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than the events on the field suggested.
The Republican presidents of the House Armed Services Committee established a working group to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts. Analysts said senior military officials embellished their assessments of American actions against ISIS.
Central Command, in brief Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by Centcom's senior leaders generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the field showed, and were invariably more positive than in the analyses of other entities in the intelligence community," the press release on the report said.
"The events at Centcom are unacceptable — our soldiers are suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level policy makers," said California Republican Representative Ken Calvert.
"The errors in Centcom's management reach the top level of the organization."
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015 by Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain conclusive evidence that reports ordered by Obama's administrators have been falsified, it gives analysts a picture that gives the impression that Centcom leaders have pressured them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements, and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events actually were," the report says.
"For example, a Centcom official publicly issued a statement that a large military assault to retake Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces manipulated the intelligence results obtained to downplay ISIS' threat in Iraq."
Republicans set up a team after learning of analysts' suspicions that intelligence about ISIS was manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Department of Defense Superintendent has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee published their own results, which were partly in line with the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
" Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process of evaluating intelligence on ISIS and Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, a committee's senior Democratic representative.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the release of intelligence results, "injured the morale of analysts" and "considered inadequately differing views."
However, according to Schiff and Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions to a "predestined or political official line."
The Daily Beast news site reported on Tuesday on the preliminary results of a study conducted by Congress.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon's Superintendent, which was initiated as a result of actions by Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, said in a statement that the Department of Defense did not comment on the Congressional report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is ongoing.
However, he says that: "Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a wholesome dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has other aftermath, in addition to seeking to determine whether US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the allegations made last year questioned how much President Obama can trust the Central Command and give honest reviews of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence about ISIS is similar to the disagreements that arose more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that found that President George W. Bush's government, despite protests from many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and spent little time reflecting on what would result from the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against intelligence about ISIS.
According to authorities, last year Hooker's team concluded that despite opposing public statements, air strikes on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's economy by building temporary refineries and thus being able to sell oil on the black market.
However, the result of the study was not passed on outside the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many lawmakers estimated that the testimony given to the Senate was too positive estimates of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel, commander of the Central Command.
US wins fourth duel in women's field hockey and establishes itself for showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a winning 6-1 game against Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's national field hockey team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I'm not one of the people who keeps track of the goals they've scored."
However, he knows this: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and lost zero games and share first place in their group with Britain, which continued its winning streak when they won 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will play each other on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams made it to the final, which determines which of them will be the first of the six teams and which will be the second.
The first place to be placed avoids meeting for a longer period of time with a hard-considered Dutch team who won the second block.
No matter what happens in Saturday's game, the Americans have already raised a stir for their surprising success in these games, four years after it was the last of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and did not grab a field hockey bat for the first time until he was 3 years old (his older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel). He made it to the national team at the age of 16 and was thus the youngest national team player ever.
He missed the 2008 Olympics when he failed to make it to the final list of players.
Then came the 2012 Games, where he and his team saw little success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, after which things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our pace of work in London was not what it is now.
We have made a turnaround."
On Thursday night, Bam opened a goal account in the first half by hitting the ball near the knuckle in.
India had entered the game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, squirmed to the middle field, hit the ball to the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first in the tournament where US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, one hit had sunk into the American goal in each.
Briggs is now living through his success period,
as well as Bam.
"Our investment is good now," says Parnham, but how good, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic hustle and bustle, a trampoline brings Zen
Regardless of the place and time, the Olympics inevitably come across.
The events, competitions and struggles in Rio de Janeiro seem to follow as a heated message constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympic fire itself were a flaming baton that moves from a archer to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast, and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in a cafe queue without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic student, charms with his smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best time to watch and listen, would be popular with sponsors and would appear in good mood TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold on a trampoline.
The Olympic Fire does not illuminate all competitions equally.
Further away from the center, partly in the shade are lesser known sports such as air pistol shooting, archery, badminton and taekwondo.
We will always have a breaststroke, and let us stay in the championship for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favorite, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility for the past 16 years has been so limited that many people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States has participated athletes in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never made the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
In the men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and Canadians have been grabbing the women's side for the medal.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, there is an underdog charm in the trampoline, partly because in an uncivilized ear it sounds more suitable for circus school than for the Olympics.
(I confess in this context that I am not an expert, just a regular fan.)
The sport has its comic potential, which has been used in cartoons in endlessly continuous bouncing scenes of characters. But it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimming jump, that is, species that combine essentially in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "the springboard".
Ambitious masters jump with a huge trampoline that hurles them to a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as threads, folds and volts.
According to the official Olympic program, jumps are judged by performance, difficulty, and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete for the trampoline gymnastics championship, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympic Games is straight ahead.
When reaching for gold, the medals must get further, faster, up and over, sometimes across the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the finish line or output wall, they also have another goal they pursue in televised reports, namely a world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is sublime, admirable, even fanatical — and even enough to make the viewer cry.
But I also find this a little exhausting in just watching the games.
This trampoline provides a respite.
In the trampoline, the direction is upward.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast bounces up weightless like an astronaut, falls down, and easily sinks back up.
Of course, the sport also includes a competition aspect, and it is not easy either, but it does not involve a heated rush to the finish line or jumping far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympic Games can reach.
The women's qualifying matches and finals will take place on Friday afternoon and start at 1:00 p.m. local time and the men's corresponding races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which will start at 2 p.m. local time on both days.
In the middle of Olympiamania bring a peaceful and wonderful moment that in the midst of a general hustle and bustle might go unnoticed.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering and objectifying male athletes to be watched — as the U.S. male gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his panting new fan base.
An entire generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have forcibly dissolved protests demanding political change across Ethiopia.
Witnesses say several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over the past few months, the country has been shaken by anti-government demonstrations that are spreading to increasingly large areas.
Last week alone, thousands of people rushed to the streets demanding a fundamental political change.
Human rights organizations said the government's reaction was relentless.
Witnesses say police fired and killed several unarmed protesters.
The videos of the demonstrations, presumably at the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show how security forces hit young people who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall with sticks.
The UN's leading human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is all the more difficult to move forward," says Rashid Abdi, Research Director of the International Crisis Group for the Horn of Africa project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the West.
The US military and intelligence service are closely supporting Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially Somalia, with few African countries, if anything, receiving so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, with the capital Addis Ababa even having a new urban train.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
Ethiopia is still a long way from a model country for democracy, however, and human rights organisations have been constantly reporting on the government's repressive policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are quickly suppressed.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
"If the people are suppressed and have no choice but to demonstrate, it will erupt," says Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the university in Central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth is demonstrating.
An entire generation protested."
There are many topics of dissatisfaction, from land use to the government coalition's stranglehold of power.
After the widely criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat previously held by the opposition, resulting in their now ruling the entire parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing on the Eritrean border, where the escalated situation claimed hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may seek to exploit mayhem and arm themselves again.
There are many reasons why the embittered mood that has been smoldering beneath the surface for years is erupting right now.
The first is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It has only been the last couple of years that Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheaper smartphones became common and internet availability improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many can access the internet through proxy servers that encrypt their whereabouts.
Many Ethiopian youths reported that this is how they invited people to demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest groups of people in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amharas.
Oromos and amharas are not natural allies.
Amharas from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands have long dominated the country's politics and business and exploited oromas, much of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The largest demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and oromots feel that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by the Tigren tribe, which represents only about 6% of the population and nevertheless controls the army, intelligence service, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest is Meles Zenaw's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see around the corner.
Analysts said he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and using ambassadors who reconciled the relationship between the opposing parties.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles' shoes almost out of ignorance.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigren region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no trust in the security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many fear this to mean more bloodshed.
The last time similar riots were experienced in Ethiopia was in 2005, when thousands protested against elections that the government first screwed up and then stole, according to analysts.
In post-election unrest, many protesters were killed, although there were fewer dead than in the previous months, and the unrest stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for far-sighted infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant advances in the fight against poverty.
But internal resentment against the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from intensifying.
And resentment is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, in the amhara city of Gondar, protesters attacked companies owned by the Tigres, and hate speech against the Tigres is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the United States and other Western allies in a difficult situation.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft monitoring neighboring Somalia, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its allies in an already unstable region to collapse.
"This requires a tight balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was ISIS founder
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back on Friday in the latest dispute against his campaign by claiming that he was not serious about claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton several times this week as the "founders" of the terrorist group ISIS.
Clarification raised new questions for the Republican side about the presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters are also in a awkward situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these turbulent moments and explain comments he may not have intended.
Trump made the claim at an election on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Early Friday morning, Trump tweeted and said his claim was sarcasm.
Trump completely swirled his speech on the tweet from the previous day, when I said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down from his claim.
The latest criticism storm rose as Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy as support figures fell.
Trump and Clinton delivered their economic policy speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump has defended himself with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received widespread criticism when he seemed to urge Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later, he explained his comments by saying, "Of course I was sarcastic."
In this way, Trump stretches the limits of political speech and pulls his words back if necessary.
"I believe it's his way of testing certain messages that evoke a response in his supporters. He looks at how supporters react to messages, and then "clears" in one way or another depending on the reactions," says communications expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
"But I also believe he understands his claims and knows they're round enough to penetrate different sieves."
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has changed his style even more pungently in recent days as his support figures have continued to decline.
A new poll published Friday by NBC, the Wall Street Journal, and Marist reported that Trump's support is significantly lower than Clinton's in North Carolina, Virginia, and Colorado, while in Florida the situation is strictly even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming increasingly watched in the last months of his presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, where they are forced to publicly defend Trump's comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump's most prominent supporters, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani vigorously defended the presidential candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be a justified, political speech," replied Giuliani when asked if Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
"It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which Obama completely mistakenly called the 'lower series team' and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to continue its efforts when it did not manage the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of dwelling on his speeches and of discriminating attitude towards him.
He mocked "unworthy and pathetic" television commentators who are trying to find out about him, but he says they cannot succeed.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and said it would only show even more clearly that he was not fit for president.
Cafe that stopped due to excessive rent increases opens at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly sleazy café in Williamsburg, where only cash was used as a means of payment and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the café was priced out of its streetside seat on Bedford Avenue when the rent became unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, who replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals find this loss of a cafe that has been forced to dodge from middle classing to be lamented.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe there's no CBGB club anymore, Chelsea Hotel has been destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is no longer the same, new ones are also created there.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb café has Wi-Fi and can be paid by credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unpretentious.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb café is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of an old café.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things the same.
Verb orders bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso machine model.
It also re-introduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new and
added new products to the list.
bacon-chicken egg-cheese-sandwichs are available for filling capers and browned onion rings.
There are also dark rice bowls on the list.
You can no longer get beer from the café, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After nine months of holding the café, Rodriguez says he noticed that old regular customers had started to visit Verb as a steady stream.
"Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently visited a cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took walks to Verb, then still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although that Sunday he took a chai tea mix instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a list novelty.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, faithfully visited Verb since 2003.
He always went to the cafe before work and invariably ordered the same.
"I sat in a cafe every day for 15 minutes over seven, like a machine, and there they already made my voibagel with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his standard product, but occasionally he varies from bacon, egg and cheese fillings in his bagel.
Rodriguez says he doesn't hold a grudge that the soap shop took the old place.
The owners of Soap Cherie even offered to make a special soap, which is made using Verb's own cold brewed coffee.
"We may still take the offer," Rodriguez says.
Poles who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also welcomed the café with joy.
One of the new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez now says he is looking for a suitable place for it so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell the coffee cold brewed in the cafe.
The café may also expand into the adjacent building.
However, for many customers, it is enough to get their own old favorites from the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I missed the smell of a cafe."
The dreary food of the Great Depression in a new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office at the White House.
Known as the Culinarian, President Roosevelt was fond of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the foie gras pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
That day, his menu was more modest: devil's eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and for dessert, plum pudding.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity with people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds, "It was also a message to Americans how they should eat."
A couple in Brooklyn Heights both work as a food historian.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells the story of an apartment building in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new joint work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they agreed to meet with the journalist Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened the same year that a major stock market crash occurred, 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When a journalist ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was very suitable for the debate on eating a major depression.
"The dialects were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanutloaf, liverloaf, and beanloaf.
They were made from substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they are enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe is grinning.
"It must have been pressed like lead in the stomach," he says.
Before the Great Depression, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, operated on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to starving Europeans during World War I, and A Square Meal is a chronicle of the ways in which the people survived when abundance suddenly had to be abandoned.
"This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans," says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new inexpensive diet: Ziegelman said that enigmatic dishes such as cereal and stews became the main food, and pot foods were called "a great way to utilize food residues" because chefs could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the most central part of the American meal, became a sparingly used luxury.
Strange mixes were tried, the most important thing being to fill calorie and nutritional values rather than taste or even healthy kitchen reason.
While doing research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman made oven onions filled with peanut butter used as a shortage-time dish.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where
Ziegelman adds, "It was unreal.
Peanut butter and oven onion do not fit together at all.
This was characteristic of many household recipes."
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who was the head of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget keepers and to meet the challenge of making fluffy dishes like carrot cream paget.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical treats.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let me eat cake" attitude.
While publicly praising the simple food of his childhood on an Iowian farm, he himself ate, such as the millionaire and sophisticated gentleman he had become.
"He liked continental European cuisine like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate in a nearly gold-coated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was completely alienated from reality."
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife Eleanor not encouraged him to set an example on his stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, the foods served at the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared."
Many of the foods in the recession period were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continued tradition is still reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food supplies and how science has been applied to cooking.
The couple says that when writing the book, they began to better understand Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as why she couldn't throw away food.
"He was really afraid of having to throw away food," say Coe.
"People even started to feel sick about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once wind hats."
After the main course plates were emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the plum dessert they prepared at home, the same one President Roosevelt ate at his lunch.
"It's called plum foam," says Ziegelman, adding that giving a spectacular name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We reluctantly sank our spoons into a thick brown goo.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe dictated a second time and a third.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget keeper.
Gilead to be fully compensated for attorney fees for patent dispute with Merck with hepatitis C drug
A judge in the United States Regional Court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the legal fees it incurred for a legal dispute over a patent for hepatitis C drug with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
Gilead was acquitted in June of the $200 million in damages it had been ordered to violate two Merck-owned patents for successful drugs called Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni. A U.S. judge found that Merck committed violations, including false oath and other unethical practices.
In an application filed on Thursday, U.S. Regional Court judge Beth Labson Freeman says Gilead was entitled to exemption from the attorneys' fees it incurred in defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can treat more than 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and demanded private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active ingredient in Gilead drugs.
US-backed forces have taken the city of Manbij from ISIS
US-backed forces have taken over the city of Manjib, near the Turkish border, in northern Syria, when the last extremist ISIS fighters left the city, a spokesman for the troops said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) faction now scoured the city to find the last ISIS fighters hidden in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a spokesman for the SDF's Manbij Military Council, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
"The city is now in our full possession, but we are still conducting search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% federal tax
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that her and her husband's income was $10.75 million at the time and the actual federal tax rate they paid 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $5.3 million in speech fees, and Hillary Clinton, who previously served as Secretary of State, announced that she earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton announced 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set a model for financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax records.
According to custom, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax records public, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyer have appealed to a tax board audit and say it's the reason Trump hasn't released his income information.
"The move is yours" tweeted Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax information.
On Thursday, Trump's special attorney Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not let Trump release his tax records until the checks were complete.
Trump critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump's equity, his contributions to charity, business relationships, and many other ties, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken up this issue and posted a video online on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans who are pushing Trump to release their tax records.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in her economic speech in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not public tax returns," Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid little for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist quoted several tax lawyers and auditors on Friday that the situation may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have become a key issue in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning over $1 million a year would pay at least 30% tax.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At a Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, headquartered in Berkshire Hathaway, challenged Trump to a meeting where they would both reveal their tax records.
Buffet says he has also been the subject of a tax government audit and that Trump is not afraid of a tax authority, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign has released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in the city of Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5%.
Clinton's 2015 tax return shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Chili powder-filled firecracker condoms to support elephant protection in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation — elephants are being harassed by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which invented the idea a few years ago, has, together with the American organization Nature Conservancy, launched a campaign to teach volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania how residents can protect their homes and plantes without harming elephants.
Until recently, spears were used to harass elephants.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"After developing the method, we have seen attitudes changed in these villages, as now villagers can be confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without damaging them," Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
First, the intrusive elephant is harassed by pointing a flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, let's throw a chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed in a condom together with the firecracker, after which the condom head is twisted so that only the fuse is left outside.
When the fuse is lit, the condom explodes open and spreads a fine cloud of chili powder into the air.
Usually, one cloud of spice is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last resort is a thrower that shoots a fireworks fireworks known as a Roman candle into the air and generates a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish film director criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code from Arab "call" — RT News
A French, Jewish film director gave birth to a media rage after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention the Israeli area code in its country number list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah documentary on the Holocaust, vented his frustration with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the area code list provided by the hotel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed — as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked him.
The receptionist said that removing Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind the procedure shocked the film director even more.
Lanzmann said the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's area code."
Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, Israel's ambassador to Germany, interviewed by Suddeutsche Zeitung, said the incident was "a great disgrace."
"The case shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And the more shameful it is, given that we are in Germany and it is this particular hotel chain.
No more explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel of simply giving in to the alleged demands of Arabic customers.
"Hävetkä" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel quickly denied the charges, called what happened a mistake, and apologized to Lanzmann.
"The direct order to leave Israel out of the area code list was never given," writes a representative of the Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the area code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets at Brazilian students' demonstration
Students clashed with police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered together to protest against reforms in the government's public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The rioting began when law enforcement officials tried to break up a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their dismay at the government's plans participated in the demonstration.
Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin has made a proposal for a savings measure to close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, temporarily opposing Michel Temer, the president's office.
The student demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were filled with protesters in favor of the dismissed President Dilma Rousseff, while the Senate voted on the impeachment for this.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - RT Business
Since the sanctions were lifted, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagarya.
He said Russian companies' interest in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were lifted.
"Russian companies continue existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further growth in trade is one of the priorities of cooperation between the two countries," says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to $856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to $158 million.
The deal was boosted by the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
"Last year, the Russian mission to abroad in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Iran was also among the first 20 countries to travel to Russia for the first time.
And it is not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia will be broken this year," he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scots Callum Skinner scored when the British won cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner denied fame in the men's team sprint at Rio's velodrome last night when the UK trio defended the 2012 London-deserved championship.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow played the role of anchor, which he inherited from his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy from Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to thank the finish line and win from the pre-popular New Zealand team.
Britain won a surprise four years ago when Hoy won his fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they had only finished sixth at the World Championships in track cycling in London in March, despite Hoy having since left his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff, who specializes in the role of first leader.
Hindes came out at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end his racing career also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a Scottish man who was believed by British coaches and where they saw the potential he has now realized.
Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who won the championship with Hoy four years ago, set an Olympic record in a time trial, but New Zealand was faster in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in a duel.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner maintained.
A big part of the change was changing the strategy so that Hindes drove to slow down the pace at a higher gear, which allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace going.
Hoy followed as a BBC commentator and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on the podium.
Glasgow 23-year-old Skinner says, "I'm flattered by the analogy.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes, along with Kenny and Hoy, admitted to falling on the track deliberately due to a bad start.
Later, he withdrew his word and the British rivals had no appeal.
This time, there were no problems like this in sovereign victory.
Hindes says, "The feeling was like in London, all the flags of Great Britain were flying in the stands.
Our team became united over the past three months.
We have lost so many world championships that winning at the Olympics feels great."
In other words, one race, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the past five months, the five days ahead are successful with velodrome.
As Kenny has shown with his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic gold medals in one Olympics.
This would mean an account accumulation with six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and also born on March 23 (the magical date of British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
The medal achievements would then be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in a sprint that starts today and will be resolved in three days.
28-year-old Kenny of Bolton says, "At the moment I can only rejoice in this.
Team competition is always the best.
You get to enjoy winning with friends.
Winning alone is a little lonely."
Hindes says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the rank of knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in a four-man team take-off.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (at 22:42) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a dispute with the competition officials yesterday before the qualifying when the officials invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women's competition that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald, from Milngavie, reached a world record time of 4:13.260.
The UK team can now be confident that its great track cycling team will take over the middle of the Olympic Games and bring a number of medals to the country.
Since the truly exceptional evidence of full leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas behind it, the least of which is the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April amidst claims of sexism and bullying, and the end of the racing careers of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night of the velodrome show that Great Britain's already legendary reputation for reaching the top at the perfect moment is once again realized.
The future of Portland's smelter at stake due to the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminum smelter in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when a power company supplying electricity to the smelter reported that one of the factory owners is about to terminate the supply contract and it is expected that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision made by the Victorian government earlier this year not to continue the subsidies with which the factory is kept in operation.
Fixed 20 years of support will cease in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is in danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Due to the closures, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the smelter consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's smelter, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's smelter loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures are in line with the speculations that have been going on over the future of the plant for years, first caused by Australia's strong dollar and recently by the price of factory production.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says it expects three other owners of the smelter plant to also terminate their contract.
The majority owner of the factory is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says it expects Portland's production facility to remain operational, which means that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue.
AGL says the contracts are so-called hedging agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice period for the contracts is 12 months, so it will expire in 2017.
"Thus, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in fiscal 2017," says the power plant.
The potential return effects for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million "as a anticipation of termination of contracts".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa ...'s capabilities to keep the smelter in operation or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect from November this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now backed down from the agreement.
Due to the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been cautious about their assessments of both the smelter in the state of Victoria, Portland, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, AGL's Chief Operating Officer, told analysts earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
"If these factories exit the market, it will mean a significant decline in demand (electricity) in the market.
For us as a producer, that wouldn't be good news," says Mikkelsen.
Kardashians reality television star Kendall as September Vogue cover girl
A model belonging to the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of her mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of Vogue in the United States.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising face and performed at Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Week, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at the deck in a room full of my loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was followed by a strange (or perhaps just a Kardashian style?), scripted video featuring all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, Kardashian producer Ryan Seacrest), pretending to have forgotten his sister's cover. The video ends with a classic twist: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is clichéd and is used in almost all of the birthday episodes of the degree programs (Seacrest utters the words, "Did you think we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the cartoon character on children's morning TV), but Kris had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
For the appearance in the September issue of Vogue undoubtedly marks a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have made it to Vogue's cover before (she appeared on Vogue's cover together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling release per year.
A number that resembles a large picture book more than a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site Fashionista calculated that last year's 832-page opus had 615 pages of ads).
The release of the September issue cover star is expected so intensely that in the previous two years the photos of the magazine have leaked to the public even before official announcement.
Previously, September's cover models have included Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been celebrities working on the cover of the model rather than models that are celebrities.
Oscar winner and Dior commercial face Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, and a year later Lady Gaga was honored.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is more part of the model's working celebrities, he is still in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, reality TV stars, or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all about these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Due to its true TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be awkward.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "bitches".
These feelings have re-emerged when news of Jenner's appearance on Vogue's cover became public.
However, the constant beat of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model for Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking around Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
He's the advertising face of Estee Lauder makeup creams.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, whom she filmed for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on reality TV, perhaps just as a way to meet his sister and her children.
Legal aid centres turn away 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people in the country are turned away from legal aid centres each year, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will have on centres already at the limit.
Three of those seeking free legal aid and legal services in Queensland are already turned away from five people — most of them elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, and unjustified evictions and similar injustices without people fighting resources.
Public legal aid services, whose workload is already overloaded, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centers are at risk of losing another 30% of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Center, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Organization of Legal Aid Centers, thousands of people are already being turned out of the centres each year.
If the federal government does not reverse its decision, Farrell said the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centers are constantly underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away when they apply for the necessary services they need," says Farrell.
"People from violent relationships, people under an uncontrollable and crippling debt burden, families getting divorced, workers who are unjustifiably laid off — all of them have problems with legal issues, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Queenland Senator George Brandis to immediately waive these financial cuts so that people can receive the legal aid they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring funding for legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clienteles, and the Board of Directors of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump campaign filed lawsuit over employee threat with gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was filed when no action was expected after its leadership was told that the campaign's North Carolina leader had threatened an employee with a gun while driving in Jeep in February.
The event is described in an action filed Wednesday by former software trainer Vincent Bordini of the state campaign in a state court in Charlotte.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before, in his own words, he realized that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his lawsuit that campaign leader Earl Phillip "brought out a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pressed the barrel into Vincent's kneecap."
According to the lawsuit, after filing a complaint with the local and regional leadership of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Even if the gun is not fired, it will cause damage," Bordini says in his lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused general rage when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that "supporters of another additional clause" — who are considered gun owners and gun enthusiasts — can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets to elect judges.
Trump's campaign staff said the media took his words out of context and Trump did not encourage violence with his words.
Bordini claims compensation from the campaign for indifferent conduct and from Phillip for assault, assault and the mental suffering they cause.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him for a comment.
Despite the efforts, Phillip was not reached.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
There was no immediate response to the call request submitted to Phillip's consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been running a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must use Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity — not just in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the most interesting thing about Heathrow, and like the 2012 London Olympics, we made a huge effort to make our entire nation and all our regions benefit from them.
The Olympics brought tremendous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the areas around the airport.
Like the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be in an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked of it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many instead of few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs and grow the economy by £211 billion, bringing knowledge and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a great working group that has implemented an 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme on time and by staying on budget, which included the T5 terminal — voted the best air terminal of the year for two consecutive years — and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of two of the world's most congested runways.
Now they are ready to produce a third runway, supported by a £16 billion private investment.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that there will also be an expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create knowledge and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and a former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook ad blocker in cat-mouse play
Companies that earn money from online advertising are trying to distract ad blocker software has become cat-mouse play, says one company that produces blocking programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it would block ad blockers, Adblock Plus posted a blog post telling them that users can update their blocking software filters and thus again block social networking ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the ad entry codes on its desktop site so that ad blockers will find it harder to identify which parts of the page are ads.
However, Adblock says it has cleared the new codes.
Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "such a ball-to-ball between the open source ad blocker community and the distracters has been going on since the ad blocker was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repair move again.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern ad blockers have become in the industry.
Worldwide, an estimated 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company plans to invest in misleading ad blockers in its desktop app, as the spokesperson said that mobile ad blockers do not work on Facebook's mobile apps and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop ads is still high enough, which is why Facebook found the investment profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said it would update the user settings advertising tool to allow users to more control how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock's new filters, as it also says they prevent some regular Facebook posts from appearing.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email release.
"Ad-blocking programs are clumsy and ineffective, and that's why we've invested in developing user settings like advertising tools to allow people to control the targeting of ads themselves."
Woman commits suicide by leaving herself under cars on Swiss freeway
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are asking for the help of witnesses on the freeway for an accident that occurred in the first hours of Thursday, in which the woman deliberately dropped under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in the canton of the Vaud near Morges shortly after midnight.
She did her desperate act by lying on a dark road, and was hit by more than one car," Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her quest was clearly to commit suicide, and among the cars that had been hit by a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
Police say many motorists involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. Police ask them or other witnesses to the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in the newspaper Le Tribune de Geneva that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical stage in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the drivers involved in the accident will be charged.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It will remain for the prosecutor to find out," says Hofstetter.
Over the past five years, two similar cases have occurred that prevent motorists from being held responsible.
According to the newspaper, in both cases, the person walked on the freeway in the dark and the court ruled that motorists cannot expect to run into a pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of being charged with manslaughter after he ran into a man lying on an A1 motorway near Paynerne one August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court held that the police — who were responding to the distress call — were in a justified manner and the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Anyone who knows anything about the accident near Morges on Thursday is asked to call the police at 021,644 83 46 or 021,644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
NASA's new climate model estimates suggest that Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to study Venus' past with the same tools and algorithms as climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether conditions in Venus could sometimes have been similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and anhydrous on the surface and its atmosphere is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations by the researchers, Venus' slow rotational speed is explained by its thick atmosphere.
However, based on the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Venus has had a thin atmosphere corresponding to the Earth, and has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine early Venus topography.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to sustain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% fainter.
"In GISS modeling, Venus rotates slowly and its daily side is towards the sun for almost two months at a time," said GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and generates rain that creates a thick layer of cloud. The cloud layer acts like an umbrella and protects the surface largely from the heat of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are even a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its development.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet light burned the vaporized water.
As hydrogen escaped into space, all that remained was a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported on the results of the new Venus climate modeling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy to step down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado's vice president/chief Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the club would immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been doing my job as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the club's hockey operations with vigour, passion and determination," said Roy, 50, in a communication.
"Over the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth needed, and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice president of the club's hockey activities must be in exactly the same line as the organization.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not currently met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach of the year for his first season as Avalanche's head coach from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoffs and has not made it to the next two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 points in the 2015-2016 season and was five points away from Minnesota Wild while playing for another Wild Card spot at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career — two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche ranks.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and suspend strike
The main negotiators say that wage strikes on North Sea oil workers will be interrupted when all parties involved in the dispute participate in a new round of negotiations.
Strikes have been held against Wood Group, a company providing oilfield services, on drilling rigs under the control of Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks to deal with problems with recent aspects.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which they said were the first in over 25 years, in protest of possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut about 9% of tariffs on its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The company's tariff reduction follows a 10% reduction in the prices of contractors working in countries in 20114.
The company says the additional cuts will give it the room for movement necessary to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has cut thousands of workers off its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus working to streamline its operations after its megafusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude oil prices and the economic situation resulting from the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for an entire generation.
He said the North Sea was vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that benefits many and not just a few," says Anderson.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new North Sea projects in 2016, compared to about $7 billion spent on them over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of stars in the Pleiadian cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational rate of stars, which has helped astronomers to compile the most comprehensive list of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian cluster to date.
Based on the new data, astronomers are able to determine why stars in the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how the orbital times are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results to other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the weight and age of the star and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech University's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiadian cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just reaching their adult age.
They are spinning faster than ever.
With the rotational rate peaking, large amounts of star wind are discharged from the growing stars.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotational speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots (which correspond to sunspots).
The latest listed rotational speed data suggests that larger stars rotate slower than smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers — larger ones spin slower than smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiades' "dance" that slow-rotating are typically larger, while the fastest-rotating are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare star properties relative to rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian cluster provides a pillar for theoretical models of rotation of both younger and older stars," says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information about how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and stop their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of Pleiades' rotational speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
