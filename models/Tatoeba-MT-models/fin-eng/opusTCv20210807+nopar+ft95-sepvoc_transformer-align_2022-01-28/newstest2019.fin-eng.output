Eemeli Kouki led Hurricane to home win in opening - Savo Volley wins second win
As many as seven times in a row, Hurricane-Loimaa, who was on the men's volleyball Championship medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raisio's Loimu fell 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, a general player returning to Finland from Romania, was the most powerful in the Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some tunings abroad, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We got it done pretty quickly, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimus, supported Kouk with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team hacker Samuli Kaislasalo, who plays on a match-specific contract, with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with the other side, and it brought additional extra to the game.
Our game is not yet complete, but continuing the medal tube is of course the goal, Kouki said.
The most powerful Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was Savo Volley's most powerful with 18 points when the team knocked down Vantaa Ducks 3-0 next to him.
Our game was volatile, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately we were able to squeeze the win.
I had no conscious different download when I played against my former team," Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in adjacent Volleyball in the 3 Series in the 2000-01 season, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, i.e. the atmosphere on the ceiling all the time.
A good feeling was left in the home opening.
Miro was king, herring played a good game too, Tuovinen said.
Siltala's previous season in the league was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielavesi Sampo with Tuovinen as head coach even then.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most powerful with 14 points.
Michael again Akaa-Volley's star
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league points exchange, has started this season strongly as well.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Akaa-Volley took his season opening win after knocking down Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started off well on its own.
Today was a loss, of course, near, as we were in the fourth round at a loss of 17-21.
We dug up a round win, and the fifth round came at the same time," Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the most powerful Tigers in the finals were the 28-point chipper Edwards Buivids.
The countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much grip on the guy's chipper, Mikkonen said.
Finland in comparison of human capital world number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparing human capital, reports the science magazine Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was number one in the statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Previously, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and Taiwan was found on the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were ranked worst in the comparison.
When measuring human capital, the level of education of the population, access to education, skills and health are examined.
The World Bank has outlined that human capital is linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, local game ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to a great fight, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian watchman Courtois was able to fight back.
Courtois played three seasons at Atletico while he was a Chelsea player.
In the early part of the week, the International Football Association FIFA selected him as the goalkeeper of the year.
At Real, Gareth Bale got the best goal spot, but his shot was past at the end of the opening half of the goal.
Bale was left in exchange after the break due to a thigh injury.
ESPN said the disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the goal cannon Cristiano Ronaldo, who moved to Juventus in the match.
US attacks abortion law now - Powerful documentary explains why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected as President Donald Trump's nominated candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that Kavanaugh's decisive voice will reverse the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Reversing Roe - The United States and abortion rights tell how the current situation has come over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and received various degrees of support from the majority of our country's MPs.
At the beginning of the powerful documentary, gynecologist Colleen McNicholas is found, who has remained the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri due to law extortion.
The clinic's armed guard said he was defending U.S. religious freedom.
News videos remind us of deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a coalition of Lutheran churchmen guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but actually they are not even needed, a photograph of a woman who died of a self-made abortion is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States in about 5,000 years.
The legalization of abortion was particularly defended by the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, California's abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, it was Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, who began to transformately confuse religion with politics to hug voters.
His abortion also swirled his successor George Bush Sr.
And Donald Trump did the same.
The documentary reaches the deepest heart of the matter in its search for the root cause of abortion politicization.
When religious organizations that supported segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as the stick horse.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing this, the U.S. is in a situation where the president, who boasted with his sexual harassment but caught the voices of the religious right with his abortion position, has elected Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment, as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh can gain power based on the horizontal language status to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shoots seven Palestinians, including two children - large protests at border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.
Two children are among the dead, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health: boys aged 12 and 14.
The ministry says 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these bullets were wounded.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made an air strike in the border zone when the protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli forces.
The military says it has started using force so that protesters do not break down the border fence or run to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the border.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters called for Palestinian families to enter the areas from which the Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped with kites and helium balls sent from the Palestinian side have ignited forest areas and farmland in Israel.
Teemu Santa got a penalty kick - couldn't shoot himself
Wigan's slipper Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to the referee Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute Santa was knocked down.
Ward showed a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Championship.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR in style with a pectoral muscle.
The work tasted like Santa again.
After losing the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goal situations and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was fifth in two weeks.
The team continues in the league cup.
There's a five-win streak in the back.
Pedophiles' help service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40,000 people experience interest in children
It is estimated that 2% of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in preteens.
In Finland, this means about 40,000 people.
So far, those who have been sexually interested in children or young people have found it difficult to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Criminal Welfare Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an email flood and appointments were booked very quickly in Sexpo, which offers advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
Sexual preference for children is a disgrace to many.
Most of those who notice pedophile feelings in themselves have not carried out their fantasies and thus did not do anything criminal.
However, preference is usually a permanent quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and discourage them.
They also complicate normal life," says Patricia Thesleff, a sexual therapist at Yle, who is a specialist in the project.
I think work is valuable if even one child is spared sexual violence," Thesleff says.
Korean leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, US President Donald Trump may sound strange in a sudden, but Trump is one of the biggest favorites to receive the award based on betting odds.
Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to nuclear disarmament, at least at the level of speech.
The biggest favorites for Nobel Prize winners in peace are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and promised to seek a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is considerable, as last year the gap was still chilly.
Yet rewarding Kim, who has been threatening for years with nuclear weapons and leading his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and Friday will be the most attention-bearing, or peace prize.
If the award is not given to participants in Korean Peninsula diplomacy, one of the top candidates is Congolese physician Denis Mukwege.
The respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has become the leading expert in his field in the world.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, a gruesome byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has said that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind if he had the Nobel Prize.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself," Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The award I want is a victory for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
However, there are things that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often recognized individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and the multipolar world order - the very kind of international cooperation Trump has seen as his opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been given to three American politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So rewarding Trump would require an ideological turnaround from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in tunnel: Drivers behaved like lemmings and drove in the wrong direction
Traffic chaos in the number one Lohja occurred on September 8.
Due to the announcement, traffic in the tunnel area was cut off in the direction of both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that it was a system failure, the fire department sought to make traffic normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said it could not be opened because there are motorists on the road with a shock and they drive how it hurts," said Pasi Kääriäinen, the firemaster on duty, who was fresh at the time.
At the time, the motorway was even driven in the wrong direction just after waiting.
When the first one starts working against traffic rules, a few others often follow suit, Tapio Heiskanen, Transport Safety's contact manager, is amazed.
According to traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must not stop except for compelling reasons.
Road safety reminds us that in exceptional situations, you cannot start to endanger traffic with hasty solutions.
Alarm vehicles must always be given the most unhindered passage possible.
Driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is especially prohibited, as is making and cancelling a u-turn.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels, where headlights must always be turned on.
Stopping without a compelling reason is also prohibited, as is parking, of course.
There have even been cases recently where the driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for that activity," Heiskanen says in a press release from Liikenneturva.
Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party, even though the ship was caught on the lakebed
The Ilves fans carried by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on board to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught in the lakebed by its bow, says Juho Syrjä, who was the ship's chief at the time of the incident.
M/S Tampere, which was travelling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted off its route late Saturday night and was caught in the bottom of its bow in Vanajavesi, Akaa.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was injured in the Haver.
Ilves fans would have liked to have continued their party on board until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them by fire department ride to the port and bus home," Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended with Ilves' 4-3 win.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's haveri was due to the fact that the water surface in Vanajavesi was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest fairway sign was covered in gulls, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more notable collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had undercut the bridge of the motorway between Tampere and Helsinki.
There was no greater drama involved, according to Syrjä, as the ship's speed was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to Syrjä, being caught in the bottom has not caused any leaks or printings on board and with this prospect the cruises of the ship continue normally.
The diver went to check the condition of the ship on Saturday morning before the ship began to be towed off the shallows.
We will go to the shipyard to check that this did not cause any damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes that the next cruise in M/S Tampere, booked next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season continues until Independence Day, he said.
No use for ambulances
The rescue services received an alert on Saturday night after just half past twelve.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulances.
Matti Willman, the on-call firemaster, said late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult due to darkness and a rather strong wind.
After half past three on the night before Sunday, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Department announced that all those on board had been evacuated and passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump judge candidate accused of harassing and drinking may be left without top office
Brett Kavanaugh, who was presented as a U.S. Supreme Court judge, may well be left without the office he is seeking, says Programme Director Mika Aaltola of the Institute for Foreign Policy.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person for the post.
It has occasionally occurred in the United States before that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court justice has raised a great deal of conflict.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
This is how the president has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain on the Democratic laurel
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a very sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision will likely rain in the Democratic Party's laurel in the upcoming midterm elections.
It would raise the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment will not take place for every presidency, as in the United States, Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at the age of about 70-80.
Even some Republicans hesitated to call
The candidates for the Supreme Court of the United States are normally subject to a background check, Aaltola says.
Although Trump has only set a one-week deadline for further investigation by the FBI, it can still bring up something essential, according to Aaltola.
It might bring.
Rarely is smoke without fire, says Aaltola.
According to Aaltola, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or incompatibility for the post will still be discussed in a lively manner before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate by 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican senators are thought to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be to take the nomination to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
Woman identified Salisbury suspect as military intelligence agent
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she recognizes a Russian man suspected of poisoning Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman said, based on the photos, that it was an Anatoly Tshepiga working at the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia previously reported revealing one of the suspected men from poisoning to Chepeiga.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that men's current identities are covert identities.
The BBC group travelled to the Far East to a village near the Russian-Chinese border, where Tshepiga grew up.
A woman living in the village identified young Tshepigan from the images released by Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from pictures of British police who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov, a man who now calls himself.
Russian men are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded the Order of the Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies the suspect's GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning said in an interview with Russian TV earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Elderly as throwing bags in health and social services reform
A vivid example of what the change limiter for health and social services reform defined by the Sipilä government means in practice has now been obtained.
My birth municipality Vaala's health and social services services are provided by the Oulunkaare Municipal Authority, whose former Regional Director of Attendo has been elected as the Director of Health Services in 2016.
The directors of the joint municipal authority warn the council of a restriction on change.
If health and social services expenditure now rises, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city centre decision-makers were frightened, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in care for the elderly, which would stop institutional care and a small unit for the health centre ward.
Home care would be increased, which means that elderly people living in remote villages are torn from their roots next to the health centre as "home".
Attendo was confident that the municipality would pay the customers for it.
The Vaala left did not swallow bad preparation, but organised a good public event with many relatives, close nurses and also delegates from other parties.
I presented the preparation of the health and social services province with slides, how the municipality of Vaala already manages the elderly most at home in the whole of Northern Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a neighboring councillor, was also involved.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it again put the Oulunkaari drafters on their hind legs.
War manufacturers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
Rapporteurs only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what level of care it will receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until hospice care.
Without a nurse?
You see, the health centre's facility sites are being closed because there is no doctor's night emergency services.
Attendo will also rely on doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
Vaala's example shows how centrist officials run delegates with incomplete information and delegates are injected back against the wall with a change limiter.
This is how the centre party drains Vaala's residents, as who will stay there unsafe to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move out.
Was there one election phrase in the city centre that the whole country is kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens Grand Mosque in Cologne
Thousands of people in the German city of Cologne demonstrated when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine River since morning.
Erdogan you are not welcome, read on the signs of protesters, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit on Thursday, and security measures have been strict.
In Cologne, about 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey in advance.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, police had isolated a large area of the mosque from the environment for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised his visit to Germany as having been successful and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
Merkel stressed, however, that there are deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
The review surrounds the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia State Prime Minister Armin Laschet cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come to a protest against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who cannot take the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan's trip to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish-based.
Three charged in Slovakia with murdering journalist
Three people in Slovakia have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said on Friday that three people are charged with the murder of Kuciak and his fiancée in February, as well as other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied the connections between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
Police have suspected the murders were related to Kuciak's investigation.
The incident and Kuciak's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with Karelian distribution on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Due to the fault of the printing, Sunday's Karelian will also have to be mailed unaddressed.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in sparsely populated areas where distribution into joint boxes has to be carried out from memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday's magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Mailing puts extra newspaper bundles in the province.
The magazines of subscribers to the rest of Finland will not be mailed separately until Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heilala live today in his upcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling of her upcoming space trip, which she booked from Virgin Galactica as early as 2010.
The price was 151,000 euros, which needed a bank loan to pay.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the departure date has been postponed year by year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky test flight that occurred in 2014 and even claimed death, things are on the hook.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or at the latest next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means his trip is about a year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and the weightless space is 5 minutes at 100 km altitude, a Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming website.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his longing for space.
As a child, I read a comic book called Space Travel and saw a Star Trek series on TVs.
Star wars have been seen and that's what the idea was about...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude host
Manchester City continued its lossless passage in the Premier League when it knocked down Brighton 2-0 on Saturday.
The sixth win of the reigning champion team is guaranteed by the goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was allowed to direct his fourth hit of the season at close range to an empty finish when Leroy Sané found him at the back post of Brighton's goal in the 30th minute.
Agüero raised his own goal balance to five when he sawed Brighton defense with Sterling to pieces in the 65th minute of play.
The Argentinean was able to place the final 2-0 figures at the penalty spot easily.
City, which started the season with six wins and one draw, leads the Premier League with a 19-point catch.
Liverpool, however, who have played one less game, are only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round match on Saturday night.
Youth clubs selected new decision-makers in Joensuu
At its meeting, which ended Sunday, the Finnish Youth Clubs selected new decision-makers for their next three-year term 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo was elected as Chairman and Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme as Vice Chairman.
40 ordinary members and 40 deputy members were elected by the Board of Governors, the Finnish Youth Clubs will inform on Sunday.
The Youth Society meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural hobby activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Young Society Meeting in Joensuu makes three promises in its three-year operating goals: We keep the doors open to everyone, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of place of residence and background, and support volunteering and people with their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Society says in a press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "Losts a very important driver"
In an interview with Swiss newspaper Blick, Mersu's British driver was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel at the World Cup points by 40 points.
Just under three weeks ago, Ferrari said that Räikkönen would not continue in the team next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Hamilton does not believe that Räikkönen will hit gloves at the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that Räikkönen has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of Formula One, I played F1 on PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy," Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian race.
From the pole spot to the race starting at 2 p.m., Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas leaves.
The evening paper follows the race moment by moment.
Football A-Young Championships became a full farce: opponent arrived with only 7 players
The top league of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
Before the round that began at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship campaign were clear: FC Lahti Academy is enough for first mode in practice to score a point against Vasa IFK.
To reverse the situation in the final round, Ilves, second in the championship, must win the PK-35 and wish the Bayers a loss.
However, the Lahti championship was confirmed in practice even before the start whistle, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one fewer Vaasans, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
In the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One reason for the stakes' player coverage is that the team has played partly the same players in the A-young SM series, i.e. the P20 series and the men's Two C-block.
Vasa IFK has played in Two against the fall of the entire season.
In the final round of the second round on Saturday, Vasa IFK is forced to win JBK in a away match and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Toivala, Siilinjärvi.
Car ends up on roof in Eno - rescue department says luck was involved
The passenger car drifted out of the road and ended up on its roof at Eno on Juttuvaarantie on Sunday around 9 a.m.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, the rescue services said.
Good luck was with you, the statement said.
Rescue services said the road was wet after the rain.
A police patrol visited the scene of the accident.
Supo expects new ways of intelligence: Equipment procurement and recruitment already done, planning abroad from operations will not be snorted
According to Antti Pelttar, Head of Supo, the Intelligence Act has been prepared for by making equipment purchases and training personnel.
With the entry into force of the intelligence laws, the budget for the reduction would be permanently increased by approximately EUR 10 million.
The premises of the Security Police (supon) on Ratakatu in Helsinki are already preparing a full head for the entry into force of intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, head of Supo's compositional background, tells Western Media that equipment purchases have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams starts with a video of her singing topless campaign for awareness of breast cancer
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is shrugged again.
Now she campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account where she sings only her hands in front of her breasts, reports AFP.
The song is the 1991 Australian hit I Touch Myself by The Divinyls.
In the video, Williams supports the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I voiced The Divinyls' global hit to remind women to regularly do self-acting [breast] checks," Williams writes in his Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in an uncomfortable area, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women regardless of skin color all over the world.
Early perception is the a and o of all things - it fears many lives.
The Divinyls is co-authored by Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was done in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was released early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
There is a controversy in the US Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams became the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men are accepted for much more violent behavior than female players.
Chinese restaurant on mountain trail is not suitable for high-rise combs
The restaurant serves not only traditional Chinese delicacies but also stunning scenery.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It is literally located on the cliff.
You can look at the forest that spreads below if you wish.
The rugged scenery at heights causes restaurant visitors to gasp for their lives in the Longquan Mountains.
Getting to the restaurant requires hiking in the middle of peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on 19 September 2018.
YouTube comments wonder where the restaurant toilet is located.
Hiking to the restaurant requires good bottom condition, the place is told.
Korpela's alley run ends today: This is how it all ends
All good things will end in time.
Today, that is what happens to the domestic country drama Korpela alley run, which has been quite liked.
The third season has gone like hot rocks: last week, 722,000 Finns watched the episode on television.
The top figures themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no continuation of Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen's series.
In the final episode, a big leap forward is taken in the relationship between Charlie and Mirku, and I think Charlie's mother is the first to guess what's to come.
Even between Anssi and Miisa are warm, downright romantic in light of recent events, but then Laiho appears once again.
Police are also sceptical about the man.
But no one can foresee Laiho's fate in advance.
Anita, on the other hand, will hear incredible news.
Kauko's last will is revealed, which brings a woman to the brink of tears.
In a week, Sorjonen will continue on Sunday evenings with the latest episodes.
Korpela alley run today on TV1 at 9:05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here are the facts for and against
The flu season is hot.
Many people wonder if they will stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is worth it to start infecting others, as the disease can be contagious even if your own symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu suddenly strike, sometimes they appear creeping.
In the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms feel small, says Prevention.
So is it worth staying home?
The prevention says that the flu is contagious even when the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus is transmitted as early as the day before the symptoms begin and from then on from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or at work.
You can go back to work when the cough subsides and the fever is no longer there, says Gregory Poland, a professor of medicine.
Training is also worth avoiding.
Too fast a return to the gym slows recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, throw in a handkerchief, and throw snot papers in the trash.
Painful to move anyway?
If you have to leave the home sick, consider wearing a protective mask.
The mask does not keep viruses in check, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then your fingers will not be put in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The sneezes are also limited with the mask.
How, then, can infections be avoided?
The best way is to still wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
In the United States, for example, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finland repeats Miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
Hockey players and misses are often associated.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23,.
The 2018 Miss Finnish Crown has been signed by Alina Voronkova from Pertunmaa.
Beauty now lives in Lahti, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is Ingrian and her father is Russian.
Voronkova was bullied by his father's Russianism at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied for my Russianness.
In Pertunmaa I had no friends at all, Alina says at the publication of the semifinalists of the Miss Finland competition.
After high school, Alina decided to start clean and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon the Miss Beauty found new friends and everyday life went rolling as desired.
At the age of 15, you think you're an adult, but when you think about it afterwards, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurr, who is familiar with the Pelicans ranks.
Since his career as an SM-liiga, ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team at the World Cup for 18-year-olds.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get into the winning trio and with it I had a career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we had to live separately, we have a good confidence and the good thing about the remote relationship is that that the initial spark stays over all the time," Alina grinned in May.
With joy of constant growth, death on our heels
Almost everyone is concerned about the resilience of the Earth.
Yet little is wanted to be given up.
Sustainable alternatives to continuous growth are sought, but even the theory of moderate economy runs into major problems.
The continued growth of the economy has brought a standard of living to ordinary people over a few generations, especially in the northern hemisphere, which could only be dreamed of before.
However, the long-standing crossing of the Earth's carrying capacity and climate change are causing this stone foot of the market economy to waver threateningly.
Two men were stabbed on the night before Sunday in Kannelmäki at Sitratori at four o'clock in the morning.
Born in 1986, the man was seriously injured in the stabbing and the second, born in 1968, was less severely injured.
The older of the men has already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person whose potential contribution to the stabbing is being investigated.
Police are also looking for another suspect related to the events.
Events are investigated as attempted killing and aggravated assault.
IFK Mariehamn's important point - Inter coach regretted mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt handicap goal against Inter brought the team an important point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the handicap of the 1-1 finish match in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through the right side and happily lifted the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
On the guest draw, the Mariehamns reached two points at the Turku Ball Club, which is the location of the series hair.
An important goal and a valuable point, summarized Mariehamn head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said the team did not, however, engage in the kind of battle he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes during the opening period, but fortunately the goal of the Turks brought us more strongly into the game.
Home team Inter head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but scoring again caused pain.
One defense mistake took our full point pot, Allen lamented.
We were the best again!

Lehtärä showed his underpower expertise, the slot is not yet certain
Jori Lehträ's strong underpower play emerged when his NHL club, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their last practice game before the season began.
Philadelphia won Boston 4-1, and Lehtärä fed Michael Raffl twice to score.
In recent days, Lehtärä has been on display due to drug suspicions.
MTV said on Wednesday that Lehtärä is one of 23 suspects in drug abuse, where some are suspected of drug use and some are suspected of selling, for example.
Lehtärä has denied committing the crime.
The club and player have discussed the subject, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Sam Carchidi, a Philadelphia Inquirer editor who closely follows the Flyers, estimated after the match that Lehtärä is part of the group of six attackers, five of whom will be placed on the NHL team.
In the practice match, Lehtärä was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehtärä fought the puck for himself underpower, pulled the defender on him, and fed Raffl, who was waiting in front of the goal, into the open position.
For the second time, the two's collaboration brought the goal at the end of the match.
The Flyers will begin the NHL season on October 4 with a away game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defender Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching management to decide whether to join the NHL group.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of this.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I believe I am ready for the NHL," Vaakanainen said in an interview released on Boston's Twitter account.
Libra woman, who learned hockey in the river boys, played against Philadelphia for 19.31 minutes.
With the Boston goal, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and rejected 20 times.
Flies-backed defender Vili Saarijärvi scored 1-0 goals for Detroit when the team knocked down Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary's ranks, Ilves was raised, defenseman Juuso Välimäki got a pass point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
Oilers rested Jesse Puljujärvi and goalkeeper Mikko Kosk, among others.
Aleksander Barkov of Florida played for over 20 minutes and scored in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara pitched his team's consolation goal halfway through the final round when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the goal of the lost, Joonas Korpisalo rejected 23/27 pucks.
Already over 180,000 responses to the time survey
Citizens have actively responded to the survey on the decision on Finland's coming time.
The question of whether Finland should apply winter or summer time permanently in the future has already garnered over 180,000 responses.
The survey opened in Otakantaa.fi can be answered for less than a couple of weeks.
Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in the same time period as the other Nordic countries, the Baltic countries, Central Europe or Western Russia.
Fresh picture shows change: World's strongest man lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the strongest man in the world, is undergoing a striking transformation.
Eddie Hall, a British man, hunted the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and with determination.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and weighed 200 pounds at its highest, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted that he was doing damage to his body.
The human body is not created to be this size, Hall said.
The British hunted the victory of the world's strongest man race at all costs and a family man promised to end his career if he gets the title.
Hall didn't want his children to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was no longer seen in the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram where he poses in a much slimmer condition than his active career.
Hall writes that his current weight is 169.5 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now trains five times a week aerobically.
The program includes boxing, cycling and swimming.
Hall also does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, HafȘór Júlíus Björnsson, also known from the Game of Thrones TV series, weighed into the strongest man in the world.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was number one in 2000.
Restaurant ship M/S Tampere crashed aground in Pyhäjärvi - "Supported to catch with rock"
The inland waterway ship M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday night in Akaa, Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue services received an alert for a water traffic accident on Friday night after 6:30 p.m.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has been rocked, and is firmly attached to its bow with a rock, said Matti Willman, the fire master on duty.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
The rescue services said personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland off the ship.
Now they are being moved by bus to Tampere, Chief Jari Nieminen told STT after 1:00 a.m.
Ambulances were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship that had travelled from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusensalmi.
Police are investigating the cause of the events.
Matti Willman, the on-call firemaster, said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and a rather strong wind.
Rescue services say the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship is not leaking.
After the evacuation operation, the divers will begin to check what the situation is at the bottom.
Built in 1957, M/S Tampere is now a restaurant-ship inland waterway vessel with a maximum number of 180 passengers.
There is also a meeting room for private use on board.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has been restored in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
Boxer Robert Helenius' tonight's match against Erkan Teper is overshadowed by a money dispute.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on a challenge application submitted by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and LLM Jussi Kokkila, in which Helenius and his late payment interest are charged for a total of over €80,000 in unpaid manager fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15 April 2014 to 30 January 2015.
We've been trying to compromise, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done," Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a response to Iltalehti explaining the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required amount.
According to Vastine, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Helenius and promised to be able to arrange matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius was only obliged to pay percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in professional athletes' management activities.
Salary work has never been agreed upon and it would have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
No written agreement was ever made on the cooperation.
According to Vastine, Helenius would have liked to have agreed on a distribution of income in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not produce the draft until late 2014.
He said the proposal was poor on his own behalf and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius never fought when dealing with Kokkila and Helminen.
One year after the end of the collaboration, Helenius had been assigned an "unindividual but extensive" bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been filed.
Helenius considers Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent activities to be cowardly, the counterpart states.
Helenius today encounters the heavyweight challenger list of the Boxing Federation IBF in the seventh Erkan Teper Stuttgart.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-term radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 of incurable liver cancer.
The host's death notice was published in the Helsingin Sanomat on Sunday.
The announcement reports that Päll died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on her Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened by the knowledge of the acquaintance's fate.
He left Facebook earlier as if he were saying goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Päll a multi-talented expert who became a great journalist.
He recalls that Päll was a liked person with fast hoxots and funny stuff.
I got to know Erki as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy when I was 12 and started there as a warehouse man.
We met with Erki at the time.
He was then a spokesperson for Finnyly and in various positions," Ile Vainio recalls.
As I proceeded to make records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I saw what a big fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly on the skin of his interviewees.
He was a man of heart and a good journalist.
For many, he became familiar as a respected radio host of Yle, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me many times.
He was good at talking, Vainio praises.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to journalist work at Fazer label Toivo Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
Päll's biggest passion, however, was radio work, in which he had an original style.
He has been doing radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar to numerous listeners in Yle's ether.
Pälli retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the annual period ending in May of the union showed a profit of approximately EUR 450,000.
The union describes its economic situation as an experienced "full-turn", although the economy is certainly burdened by "significant debt in the balance sheet".
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as quickly as possible last autumn, taking adjustment measures.
Careful planning and financial management of operations has become instilled throughout our organization," Kulmala says in a statement.
We have also been very successful in partner procurement and, in addition, the return on the World Cups was maximum during the past competition season.
However, in the future, cost management must continue to be accurate, and at the same time we must constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital backyard in the town of Palu on the Indonesian island of Sulawes.
Only one building separates them from an area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also being treated outdoors due to aftershocks.
One of the people who moved around the hospital area was the 52-year-old Barhuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the yard of the Army Hospital, Dwi Haris lay in Palu, who has suffered injuries to his back and arm.
He was at a local hotel with his wife and daughter when the quake began.
The family was invited to the Return Wedding Party.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe," Haris told AP, according to British media.
Small shops are looted
At the Palu Evacuation Center, 35-year-old mother of a small baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tight.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are looted everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many residents of Palu have slept outdoors or in temporary bamboo huts.
Even if the house is somewhat upright, any aftershocks could destroy it once and for all and bury the residents under them.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there are possibly about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala Prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
The newspaper said the prisoners became enraged and set fire to the prison after guards told them not to leave to find their relatives affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
Palu Airport has been reopened mainly for relief flights.
Among the first ones, an army C-130 transport plane landed on the field, bringing relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Palu Airport are only allowed to a limited extent.
Pilots are forced to land at the airport without air traffic control assistance, as the air traffic control tower was severely damaged by an earthquake.
Rain sweeps at night over Finland
A long rainy area spreads across the country on Sunday night from the west direction, says the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
Rain comes mostly as water, but sleet or snow is expected in central and northern Lapland.
The cheap frosts of the previous night are not repeating, because under the cloud cover temperatures remain higher.
A cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty effectively under control.
In the west, you can visit the frost side for a while, said the on-call meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will give way to the east during the morning.
There are pouts or semi-clouds in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures move all the way to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The starting week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Wind and surfing warnings are in place in the sea areas.
There are no actual autumn storms to be expected for the next few days, but otherwise there will be variable weather for a typical autumn.
Autumn is really starting to push on, Ilkka said.
Miss Finland final not seen on TV
From IL-TV you can follow the glamour and sparkle of the red carpet of the Miss Finland competition.
Entertainment journalists in Iltalehti are broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from Billnäs Ironworks.
The broadcast starts at about 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned from a group of ten finalists on Saturday.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnäs Ironworks in Raseborg.
Before the final starts, you will be able to follow the atmosphere on the spot on the live broadcast of IL-TV.
Live broadcast starts at about 6:30 p.m. and continues for about an hour.
This year, a special number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland Jonna Ziprus of 1998.
Other jury representatives include welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, Jouni's Trade CEO Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Seiskan news producer Katja Lintunen.
We were hoping he'd go to college before he went to the Miss Games.
The Russian Dimitri father and Ingrian mother Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov, parents of the fresh Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, proudly followed her daughter's first moments with a crown on.
They applauded the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finale.
It's a wonderful atmosphere!
We believed in Erika all the time, but half an hour before the result, we started to get nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is Ingrian and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived in Finland throughout her childhood.
Svetlana says that Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than Miss's career when she was a kid.
Alina was often told that when she is so pretty that she should start as a miss.
But he announced that he wanted to be a radio host.
Only later did Alina get excited about beauty pageants.
The parents' wish was that Alina would be able to go to college before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
This was the case, and eventually Alina still wanted to do her bachelor's degree before the Miss Games.
We asked him last year why he wasn't participating, but he wanted to finish that cand.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a wholesome example for young people and adults as well.
He does a lot of sports and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on display, it shows.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is ice hockey for a living in Japan, and she couldn't get to Finland to encourage her love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between the young people lasts for Miss Year.
Yes, that is the intention!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It has been such a long break to visit because of the missikirs.
I miss you already, even though you've been sending messages.
Young man killed in hit-and-run in Lahti, police arrested three people
Police say three people have been arrested as a result of the incident.
Häme police on Saturday did not comment on the course of the events or the possible intent of the overrun, citing the incompleteness of the investigation.
Police also did not comment on whether the captured persons and the man who died in the hit-and-run knew each other before.
Further information on the case will be available at the beginning of next week at the earliest.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book popped into mind: lack of drawing skills did not slow down
The organic fool once left my husband's phrase, in which he suggested it as a person for the story I developed, says Sari Piippo, an Espoo comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU translator in Brussels in economic and legal matters until after her fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I have enjoyed being a housewife very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me what you would do when even the smallest child was already starting to be big.
Then in 2014 a comic book came into the picture.
Piippo says he had never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Donald Duck, Tint and Asterix since he was a child.
I had last drawn as a child, but when these organic nonsense manuscripts began to emerge then, the situation changed.
I did some dozens of manuscripts in the drawer at first.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a skilled sketch artist, but I couldn't lure her into it until the summer of 2016 when I bribed Viivi with a record plate.
His enthusiasm lasted a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughs Piippo, who tells him that the record was a great encourager for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, says Piippo about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
The scripts pop into my mind all the time, but I don't usually do it at once.
One three-screen strip takes up to several hours.
I may make a screen at a time and be happy to play with the colors.
Getting started with drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest sport.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates Scott Adams' Dilbert, among others, from contemporary newspaper comics.
The characters in the organic nonsense are a carrot-bodied mother who has a salad hair bush who has been into the L-theme.
Other people include Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the world of organic nonsense, man is what he eats.
The ideas in the series come from one's own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a forced bun even though the Organic Hump stuffs the matter sometimes.
Piippo says he reads his series with his husband and children.
It's such a great feeling to watch a comic book you've drawn and say this is what I've done today.
And there are plenty of challenges for the housewife!
The organic nonsense series can be read online at organichomppa.cartoonblogs.com

Indonesia earthquake: Air traffic controller sacrificed himself - did not leave a cracking tower until he got hundreds of passengers to safety
The 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become the hero of the earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung was left alone in the air traffic control tower until he could safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people from an island shaken by an earthquake.
The young man was on duty in air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city of Palu when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat before being able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway into the air.
This allowed him to save hundreds of lives," the Indonesian aviation administration told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control tower trembled and cracked.
Eventually, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg was broken and he suffered severe visceral injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, a spokesman for the aviation administration told The Jakarta Post.
The quake continued to intensify after the flight entered the air, and its intensity was eventually measured at 7.5 magnitudes.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian aviation administration has respected Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn ponders Europe's end in trade war: "We need to watch the following tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
Director General Olli Rehn said in Yle's first morning that while the tightening tension has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn is reflected in the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is so far a good talent.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be at the feet of a trade war.
I'll have to watch the next tweet and then evaluate.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington, but he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the Western world as a whole.
The market reacted violently yesterday to the Italian government's clearly deficit budget on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit will be over 2.4% of the national product.
Rehn finds the situation in Italy worrying.
5% of the country's loan stock is problem credit and more than 10% is unorganized credit.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country seems to again exceed its commitment to its European partners.
It may not be worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if Italy would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another thing that is trying Europe is Britain's withdrawal from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be at peace.
A conflicting difference would have much more negative effects.
Rehn started as the Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), will withdraw from office in just over a year.
The debate over his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen's name has flashed in speeches.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are included, Rehn said and added that he won't comment further than this.
HS's super popular Black Box performances continue again next week - last tickets to Helsinki are on sale
The popular Black Box performances organised by Helsingin Sanomat will continue again in the week that begins.
Other performances will be seen at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On October 23, the Black Box will visit Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There are still some tickets for sale at the National Theatre.
Tampere's performance is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
Journalists and photographers on stage during the evening will tell the true story they have long prepared, which has not been published before in any HS instrument.
There is something else that no one has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the globe and a talking story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet with HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has been organizing live journalism nights for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the beginning.
More than 15,000 people have already visited the stands.
The black box was awarded the Bonnier Awards as Journalist Act of the Year.
The award winners praised a new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to come close to their readers.
The 2019 Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March and April.
The performance also visits Tampere and Turku.
The presentation seen at the time has different content than the nights this autumn.
Missing mushroomist found thanks to "prejudiced experiment"
The drone expertise of the Finnish police is among the top in the world: "We are being asked about trainings"
According to the principal of the Police University College, the police can use the drone in addition to searching for missing persons, for example in criminal scene investigations and intelligence missions.
Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom inhibitor in Raahe on Tuesday with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the principal of the Police University of Applied Sciences, tweeted the incident, mentioning, among other things, that "through unprejudiced experimentation and effective education, we are also among the top in the world here."
Drone is a fairly new thing and even newer in police duties.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has been evident, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported at international events.
There is a lot of interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There would be a lot of visitors to see the drone activities of the Finnish police.
We are asked for training.
Further generalization
Himberg reminds us that finding someone who has disappeared in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost was found with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg said more were to be trained.
Already, drones are used a lot in police duties, and their use will become more common and increasing in the future.
I would venture to say that, Himberg says.
In addition to searching for missing people, police can use drones for example in accident or crime scene investigations and certain types of intelligence missions.
For example, you already have to check an area a little further away, where there may be fears that violence will be encountered there.
Drone can then be used for pre-intelligence.
Karelian Rugby reaches number one divar
Rugby in Karelia celebrated the 2nd Division victory in Kuopio on Saturday.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match with a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second period and whispered to the guests of the south 26-12.
The 2nd Division Championship also knew of Karelian Rugby's historic rise to Division 1.
Previously, the club has played in number one, but at that time Finnish rugby series operations were divided into two levels, the SM series and the multi-block 1 division.
The club is going to take the show spot, but that's quite a job next winter.
The current caster of less than twenty players must be raised to 25.
Division 1 also knows the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so fundraising must also be in line with that.
Kotkaniemi starts season in Montreal, confirms head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of Montreal Canadiens, who plays in the NHL, confirmed on the club's Twitter account that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise in the first round of Kotkaniemi, 18, with number three at the summer draft.
The attacker joined Montreal's training strength in late summer and has presented strong excerpts in the September training matches.
In his first training match, Kotkaniemi managed to score.
Head coach Julien praised the Finnish for taking big developments after arriving at the rookie camp.
The NHL regular season will begin next night against Thursday in Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
There has been a lot of talk this week about leadership in Finland.
In an interview with HS, Nokia Chairman of the Board Risto Siilasmaa told about his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia studies have also talked about the inability of managers to act as a team; fear and speechlessness, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agility of the company's rise phase disappeared.
During the week, the Nordic Business Forum, a giant business event, was also held in Helsinki, Finland, and drew the cream of Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, 12 business stars emerged on stage.
There was enough talk of good leadership.
Leadership legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must dare to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that the decisions are made by those who are mentally most tied to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of stores known for its wide range of organics, said that the manager must know how to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that purpose cannot be merely making a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, who wrote a success book about introverts, said that the most successful leaders are proven to be humble.
They act calmly, quietly and purposefully.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodara, a professor of finance, pointed out that the qualities of a good leader must coincide with the stage of the company's life cycle.
In the early stages of the company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that has grown into a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were listened to by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum - mainly Finnish leaders.
They were at risk of information.
It takes a lot from a good leader.
That is why leadership so often goes wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other behind the scenes in a comradely manner.
However, they hardly wondered if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy for the outsider to judge.
Sara Chafak arrives on a red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss Finals in a stunning black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland showy dress also had a laced bay.
A little bit of jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
I spend most of my time there," Chafak said.
Chafak says he's going to L.A. for auditions.
He has done advertising descriptions, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
However, he says that work must be done even harder, as there is easily always a replacement for the model's work.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives €30,000 live art award in Kuopio
Artist Sonya Lindfors won the €30,000 Cultural Prize on Saturday in Kuopio.
Lindfors, who is awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to its immediate surroundings.
His work allows others to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments where they have previously been lacking, the jury described the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, the nominees for the award were a group of international artists.
The award is given annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
Danish police find Volvo wanted in major operation: 'We can't tell you where'
The extensive search by the Danish police has paid off.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed at the bridges of the Sound and Great Belt.
All land and ferry services from Själlanni Island were closed to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark.
Police were looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the Copenhagen Police Media Centre shift manager.
A searched car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet," Henrik Storm of Copenhagen police said in a statement.
Storm said the black Volvo sought has no direct connection to the threat, police say.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Bladet reported on a police briefing on Saturday.
Jørgen Bergen Skov, the head of investigation, was silent about the operation.
He didn't want to tell me what crime title was being used to investigate the matter.
Skov said it was a "serious crime."
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been sought in the operation.
Police are not telling us if they have already been caught.
The newspaper said the ferry traffic restrictions had been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
The STT says that police say the general public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia's name has caused decades of discord - now the people vote on it in contentious elections
Macedonia, in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
Under the Macedonian and Greek Governments Agreement, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far vetoed Macedonia's efforts to become a member of NATO and the EU.
Greece says the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the referendum does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's membership of the EU and NATO by adopting the agreement.
The vote began slowly at least at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired nurse who voted at the school, hoped for support for the deal.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means a change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contexts.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is also exciting whether the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes votes would give a mandate to change the constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required for the amendment of the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament also still has to approve the agreement.
Voting stations close at 8 p.m. Finnish time.
A handsome victory!
Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met late Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn measured his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, located next to Stuttgart.
The main game of the evening was the IBF Association's heavyweight Intercontinental title match.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to take a stand on Saturday in tougher positions of considerable financial importance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth period, when he knocked Teper out with his hard left hand blow.
Teper could no longer get off the floor.
"Nordic Nightmare" hurt his opponent in the third period, when blood began to bleed from the German nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight as early as December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
It then became apparent that the German had been scorched twice in a doping test.
Helenius has taken in 28 games from his professional career and suffered two losses.
Teper, who left for the match as a clear favorite, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton team order to win - breakup Vettel already 50 points
The Formula One championship title approached its confirmation again, as Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes won the Russian GP and stretched his World Cup point lead to Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to 50 points (306-256).
There are only five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the pole position of the race, drove second.
Bottas, who won his career in Sochi last year, held the top spot near the middle of the race, but Mercedes told Botta to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel drove third, Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen fourth.
Red Bull's Max Verstappen, which started from the last line of departure, was fifth.
The two assaulted a lawyer in Joensuu - caught a block away
Two men assaulted and kicked a 31-year-old juuka man in Joensuu at Siltakatu 12 on Saturday after 6 p.m.
Police also said the men usurped the victim's phone.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man in haywater and a 39-year-old man in Ilomantsi, shortly after the event.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police say.
The victim received bruises that did not require a visit to the doctor.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, will leave his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Musk has agreed with the US authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his tweets that he would have secured funding to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange.
The US Securities Commission (SEC) has accused Musk of securities fraud.
Musk will continue to be Tesla's CEO, but the company will also have to pay a fine of €20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada fights time to reach peace with NAFTA US
Time threatens to end in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on Nafta.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the negotiators of the countries have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on trade negotiations to the fullest.
At President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement with each other, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico want to enforce the treaty before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that plans are to sign the contract at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
Because of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday to allow sufficient time for the United States Congress to assess it.
Neighbor thinks candles were blazing into fire in Kaakkuri, fire department alerted to the scene
Candles burned in an apartment in Kaakkuri, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen rescue services units were alerted to the site due to a possible apartment building fire.
It was discovered that the candles burned in the sauna of the apartment apartment had looked like a fire to the house across the street, which was why the matter had been reported to the emergency services.
There was no fire at the target.
Police arrested 11 people after Honka-HJK match - brawl at the field and metro station
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday after the Honka-HJK match of the men's football league in Espoo, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen of the West Uusimaa Police Department confirmed to the STT.
The basis for the arrest was protection against crime and disorder.
Those caught were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The captures were previously reported by the Evening Messages.
The match ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large number of spectators rushed to the field from a stand reserved for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and fist fighting between team supporters.
Among other things, horse police officers were needed to end the situation.
In addition to the field, there was a brawl in the nearby metro station area, where some of the captures also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw from the pictures was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the brawl on the field.
According to Värtinen, no criminal reports have been filed as a result of the events.
Table stone basked the butterfly with its SE-time in the World Cup, Laukkanen also swims to the finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Tablestone have gone to the finals on the closing day of the World Swimming Cup 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
The races are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Table Stone has been stalling Finland's record in a 50-metre butterfly swim, where he was second in the initial batches at 22.82.
Earlier in September, Table Stone swam in Helsinki during the SE period of the trip on 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen, representing Cetus from Espoo, was the 24th in butterfly swimming at 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the early rounds of 50 metres breaststroke in 30.48 and advanced to the finals.
In the early rounds of the two hundred metres, Laukkanen was 15th in 2.14.25.
Students play a rare treat: an ancient tragedy - reduced Oresteia affects its visuals
Ancient tragedies are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre has most recently seen the ancient tragedy, the Sophocles Philoctetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre Academy brought to the tour beginning at the National Theatre the only play trilogy of ancient, Aiskhylos Oresteia, which remained whole.
In the Lavat open! projects that began in 2015, the Theatre Academy's acting students work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia premiered in Berlin in April.
Roiha's adaptation of Oresteia summarises the story of the end of the blood vendetta of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law to an hour and twenty minutes, especially by intensifying choir sections.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuura's fine translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and the presentation revealing the pages of the theatre space emphasize reduced and bright stage thinking.
It focuses alternately on the dynamics between the performers who break out of the choir, who play the title roles, and the choir.
The performance uses double and triple lists of name roles.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the Trojan War, and Kassandra, for example, are also shown on stage, contrary to what was customary in the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the performance does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, is created before the eyes of the viewer, who is constantly aware of his ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to bring out a rhythmic group of master's stage acting students as a close group, downright one organism.
Especially actors who bend into very expressive, sculptural group formations in choir sections get their rights on the bare, only adorned with a white curtain, stage.
Impressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues to Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures first hydrogen truck
The novelty is beginning to show in Europe, especially thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyindai and H2 Energy in Switzerland.
According to a cooperation agreement published at the Hanover IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai will supply a thousand-car batch novelty model for use by the Swiss company and its partners.
By launching a fuel cell-powered truck, Hyundai continues on the road indicated by the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a hydrogen car manufacturer.
With this first project in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refueling network," Hyundai Motor's Executive Vice President In Cheol Lee said at the announcement of the agreement.
The fists fluttered several times in Kajaani
A man in his early thirties assaulted three men at a restaurant in and off Kajaani city centre on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in his being removed from the scene.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.
Police arrested the abuser.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another police officer in the leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The matter is investigated as three assaults and violent opposition to an official.
In the centre of Kajaani, there was also another assault incident on Saturday morning.
Two men assaulted the victim.
First, a Kayan man, about 20 years old, hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and the man who had hit him before still kicked the victim.
Outsiders pulled the abusers away from the victim and police called.
However, the perpetrators already had time to leave before the police arrived.
Police ask witnesses of the event to contact Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by email at investigation.kainuu@police.fi.
Long-term radio host Erkki Pälli has died.
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Yes, this is going on now.
The doctor has said that, I live one day at a time, he commented on his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The safety of the aunts and uncles of the store must be guaranteed
I first got paid for a newspaper article in 1984.
When you get a story on these rings, it's usually a big news story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27 September) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was amazed and even a little angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a working environment expert at the Service Trade Union (PAM).
He says crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers claim otherwise.
Police are only clearly aware of cases that have been considered serious and many real violent situations remain unreported.
"Companies are, of course, obliged to record their near-miss situation on the basis of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data is not collected anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end up in the statistics.
In violent situations, there has always been a problem that they do not always cause physical injuries.
Despite this, psychological traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the situation of violence and the threatening situation of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access.
Too many people are afraid in their workplace, even though the actual act does not happen.
Some neighborhoods are restless.
The store has acquired guards.
Even when the store opening hours were released, the media's visible nonsense was quite great about its effects on seller safety.
"At the time, quite a few employers provided guard services for at least nighttime hours and to prevent working alone," Kähärä comments.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
When the security situation remained well under control, the impression arose that security would be unnecessary.
Now, many places are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive guard services.
Mild assault is a plaintiff crime, and it is quite understandable that the seller who was assaulted does not want to make a request for an investigation into a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same law, which was passed in 2011, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecutor if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time a store aunt or uncle is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor accused.
When the court put a few abusers in prison, and the sentence from the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society where the grocery store must be open almost day and night in small localities must guarantee the safety of the employees of the store.
Heidi Sohlberg signed for Miss before live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro is then married"
Miss's coronation is not seen on TV this year, but is shown on Viafree.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet are hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the host trio told the invited guests and media representatives who arrived about the passage of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a loud round of applause.
Now all the women scream!
Look at this man host of ours, Sohlberg annealed his colleagues as the audience cheered.
The front-end races are followed by many of the previous years' Miss Finland.
Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi, among others, sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg comforted, looking at the Saros.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the newly divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
Sieppi spoke of her divorce for the first time in the Evening Messages weekend paper.
Missikaunotar said she did not want to open the reasons for the divorce more closely in public, as it is between her and Scrooge Salminen.
He said he was not in a hurry for a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I am focusing on my own stuff and especially I am starting to live my own life alone," Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage status came up later when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The plot trio laughed at the screw-up.
Iiro was married, wasn't he?
Janni Hussi signed for the screw-up.
The Ostrobothnian man tortured his tied cohabiting partner by cutting, burning and feeding strong sauce
The Ostrobothnian District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for numerous crimes against his cohabiting partner.
The means of committing the crime included a belt, cable and cable ties.
The court sentenced the items in question to the state to be lost.
Rank's charge was against a suspect in aggravated rape.
However, this charge was dismissed by the district court.
Kokkolalainen was attributed to four assaults, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty and two acts of damage.
The crimes occurred between 26 March last and 24 May.
At the end of the last few acts, the man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
On Thursday of the past week, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa Prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two aggravated deprivation of liberty and aggravated rape on May 22.
However, these charges were dismissed by the court as unproven.
The case was heard in court behind closed doors.
However, the district judge gave a public description of the verdict.
According to the district judge, the accused had targeted his spouse with violence, threat and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, smoked tobacco, fed a strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
By judgment, the court ordered the state to lose criminal equipment: belt and cable, cable ties, bathrobe belt, knife and vesur.
Four Witnesses
According to the District Court, the parties continued to live together between the actions.
It can be read in the resolution that a large part of the most outrageous acts occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
For his victim, a 34-year-old must pay a total of 5,800 euros for pain, aches, suffering and temporary harm.
I don't think he has that money, because the convicted person already has debts in debt collection.
The prison sentence is not the man's first.
The evening paper does not give the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
A recent district sentence is not legally valid when writing this.
Europe in four-point lead to Ryder Cup solution
European golf professionals held their lead in a traditional hole game match against the United States on Saturday.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup, which will be played near Paris, with 10-6 points, while twelve doubles will still be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball games that started Saturday, and in the four-player game of the afternoon, the wins were leveled out 2-2.
The leading stars in Europe were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had reached the same level.
On Sunday, the two seek more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cups, and no Americans have ever achieved such a thing as three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters' violent harassment in Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
The football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning its supporters' disruptive behaviour at a FC Honka match in Tapiola on Saturday.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the statement said.
After the match ended, about 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to be trying to pick a fight with Honga supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers could not calm the situation down, but police officers and horse police were needed.
HJK said in a statement that the team's players and staff members are shocked by what happened.
The events after the match do not match the values of our traditional 111-year-old club.
"We are making a sharp statement about any activity that endangers the safety of match events," the statement said.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers identify factors that threaten safety and eliminate side effects.
Supporter culture is part of football and important to HJK.
We support positive, joyful and supportive activities in football stands in every way.
"Violence is not part of it," the statement said.
Filipino inventor flies drone car - thus avoiding traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He is now part of a world-growing group that vows to have invented a flying car - or at least its own version of it.
As competitors, he has such factors as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its device.
According to reports from the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
Six years ago, he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight - he slipped his device at altitudes of over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will evoke positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago," Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Labour action to begin tomorrow will be reflected in children's day care and social and health services
The overtime and shift change bans that will begin in the public and welfare sectors tomorrow will be visible especially in social and health services and child day care, says Päivi Niemi-Laine, Chairman of JHL.
The effects will be extensive and will certainly be visible in such a way that there are not enough staff present.
Everyone has to think about how to pick up their child.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened," Niemi-Laine told STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was also visible at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift change due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that staff have not been hired, but that employees have been left working over or switched shifts.
This is not yet a industrial action.
It is the norm, in terms of occupational safety and health, for every employee to take care of regular working hours and only do them.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to reduce the protection against the dismissal of small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, Director of Labour Market for Municipal Employers, will not pre-evaluate the effects of overtime and shift change bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations that can be made.
The area is so impossibly broad, social and health care and technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary very much by industry, region and employer," Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week we already had experience with similar three-day activities by the Association of Local and Basic Nurses Super and the Trade Union for Social Affairs and Health Tehy, among others.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL overtime and shift change ban applies to workers in the municipalities, church, state and private social and health care sectors, among others.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
The industrial action will affect nearly 100,000 JHL members at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may take a long time.
The union is also prepared for other industrial action if the preparation of the Termination Act continues.
The government should now admit that here we run to the wall and hard.
Jalonen believes that both the trade union movement and the government must come along.
That's what's special about this, that the hard ones are already in the barrel, even though the show hasn't been given yet," Jalonen updates.
The Great Coral Reef is created by children and adults - the fitness circles of the performance study the gestures of a rays and a seahorse
The Great Coral Reef of the Other Spaces collective premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, the Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish together with the audience.
However, this time a clearer-limited presentation will also be built, which will refresh and crystallize the observations made in the initial exercises.
There is also a lot of fairytale magic in theatre play for child participants.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
The Great Coral Reef is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children do in cooperation.
It provides adults with information and observations on the way children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and common games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
Indeed, the Great Coral Reef is somewhat similar to a saddle ballet, fitness circuit, and nature-related information shock, but once and for all it tunes around visits to other, non-human states.
The Great Coral Reef begins with exploring the movement tracks of corals and organisms and fish living on the coral reef.
In six different fitness districts, gestures of the ray and seahorse are learned, among other things.
Finally, a performance of less than an hour is made, with music, lights, and shiny paints and costumes helping to explore the life of the coral reef.
The Great Coral Reef is both diving people who observe the life of the coral reef and corals that are being looked at.
There are also organisms that look at corals.
The looks and observations shown in many directions make the performance dense and life-scarrying.
Whether the landscape of an organism, the organism looking at the landscape, and the other organism or landscape looking at the organism - and all this at the same time.
For children, it doesn't seem difficult.
In other spaces, the group strives to reach the limit of thinking and action, which, when the group is made up of both children and adults, is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration on behalf of endangered corals will be held at Sitratori.
Destruction beyond human understanding should not be allowed to harden, although it could be difficult to understand the significance of one's own practice of compassion in the face of prospects of destruction.
In other spaces, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears up space.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood
Today's children and young people are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking younger and younger.
I think children should be children throughout their childhood, not messing up their lives because of substance abuse and sex, because others say they do.
I was overwhelmed when my friend told me that he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade over the weekend at the "boyfriend".
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that you can't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I wish that children today could live a decent childhood and would not have to grow up too early due to the group pressure created by friends.
I constantly see younger girls on Instagram who are wearing makeup in their pictures and revealing their clothes on.
Snapchat is used to take and send photos that reveal in the evenings.
It's even harder to guess what age they're.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-olds and even parents.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I am glad that there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I was a child for many years and didn't have to think about what others thought of me.
Yle: Authorities told the state leadership that the incident Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, interviewed by Yle, the Security Police and Defence Forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helme's investigation is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime," Yle said.
The information from the sources that appeared anonymous was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva (kok), Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered financial crime.
They were quite strict that they were not speculating that there was anything else here," Kanerva said in an interview with Yle.
According to Yle's data, no evidence of a link to national security has been found so far in the material seized, but the investigation is just beginning.
We cannot yet know what may be revealed, one of Yle's interviewees says.
The extensive house searches that began a week ago in the Turku archipelago and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is a mere economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti compiled a story that goes through claims both for and against.
Video: Dream goal saved Liverpool from losing series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League start came to an end, but it was still a more satisfied team for a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to a 1-0 guest win.
At that time, Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how last season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the Premier League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool started more strongly and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to rule alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great league cup away win on Anfield Road below Wednesday.
Then Eden Hazard got off the bench to solve the match with a great individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first balled in a small space with the triangular game Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drifted a little to the edge of the penalty area, but bombed the perfect left foot bet in the back corner.
Pool brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and could only get his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt a loss position lightly unfair, because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger cleaned Mo Salah's direction from the finish line.
In the second episode, Chelsea-veskari Kepa also got into action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's bet and pushed the ball from the base of the pole to the corner kick.
At the other end, Alisson, on the other hand, reset Hazard's drive through with his throw.
The best place for guests came in the 72nd minute James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the Brass star's push was directed at national teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership.
It also didn't last another 89 minutes when exchangeman Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an irresistible bet in the upper corner in honor of it.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to an end with a 1-1 draw, but it's still at the league tip - along with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also firmly involved in the championship battle with two points behind the top.
In the clock transfer discussion, the poteros are deep
I remember a few decades ago when a magazine asked different Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Widow's answer was the only one that was remembered: the Nen terminal.
Some people have a nen terminal in their last name and some don't.
You can create dividing lines anywhere, and here was one serving.
Finland has achieved in the EU that annual clock movements are being abandoned.
Very many people agree that clock moving twice a year has been a fool's job and has caused a wide range of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide what time you will end up at: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to express their opinions on the otakantaa.fi page.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday, October 12.
There is a heated debate at coffee tables and social media, and everyone has something to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of morning light on people's well-being and summer time are defended by the influence of evening light on people's desire for outdoor activities and, consequently, well-being.
Both positions have their strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythmizes a person's day and gives alertness.
On the other hand, if you don't particularly suffer from waking up in the dark, the lightness increases people's movement outside and gives you better opportunities for autumn yard work, for example.
The amount of additional light after a normal working day has already been calculated for its class.
I'd rather take both, but bad for our location in the north of the earth, there's nothing we can do.
Winters are too dark and summers are too bright for many anyway.
Typical of the debate on the subject is that one's own vision is being pursued and another's view is being very strongly opposed.
The opposing party's arguments are hardly listened to, because the most important thing is how it feels to itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on it, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's a waste of gunpowder.
The subject is terribly easy for debate, because it does not require much dedication and there is enough mutual feeling to justify it.
Similar issues are usually disputed more sharply and equally fruitlessly.
It is a shame if the wrong option is chosen, but I think it will adapt to that as well.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life feels narrow.
Josba fought a narrow away win
Josba's first guest game in the floorball Divar produced a full three serial points against Nurmo Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a journey home with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
Nurmo still led with paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plot 6-5 winning goals.
Both teams were left behind for crucial minutes in the level.
Josba's most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepower anyway when Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of her goal.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
Next up will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
200th anniversary of Eno Church on Sunday
The 200th anniversary of Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the church of the speeding hazard a week ago was a shock.
The church of Eno was also guarded the two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place for celebration.
Even if no one wants to, Eno Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Parish Union.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite the municipal and other connections of all the world.
Family Mass begins at Eno Church at 10 a.m. today.
Then we move to the parish house by the Karelian banquet table.
Throughout the day, there are all kinds of things on the show, both indoors and outdoors.
For example, you can explore the church building with the guidance of retired Ari Räsänen, who has been the parishmaster for 37 years.
The Church's birth festival also marks the end of one era.
The already decommissioned parish house, built in 1982, keeps its doors open for the last time today.
Now we are in evasive spaces at the former municipal hall, says Markku Koistinen from Kappa.
The parish house was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has been standing in place healthy for 200 years.
Elon Musk to step down as Tesla government president - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
Tesla, an electric car manufacturer, and Elon Musk, the company's CEO, have settled their lawsuits with the SEC, the authority that oversees the US securities market.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud, and Musk was at risk of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Musk, on the other hand, is forced to step down from the position of Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company is forced to hire an external board chairman.
Musk is also under tighter supervision.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent leaders and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders," said Steven Peikin, Director of the SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
TV temporarily increased Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk was guilty of securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with the company's other management or potential financiers.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it would demand that Musk be fined and banned from operating in the management of listed companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock went into a strong decline.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia quake and tsunami
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the tsunami that followed has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster agency AFP.
The death toll is expected to continue to increase, as the damage is ongoing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could reach thousands.
Friday's earthquake sparked a tsunami that hit the town of Palu on Sulawes Island.
Immediately after the quake, a warning was issued about the tsunami, which was quickly withdrawn.
Officials say almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, Palu.
Rescue officials are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the quake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Calls for help from the ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodon, who arrived in the affected area today, urged soldiers to continue the rescue work tirelessly day and night.
One of the centers of the rescue work is the Palu hotel, which is still believed to have 50-60 people in its ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said that one person could be excavated from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which was popular with business travelers, at night.
We also heard people's requests for help, he said.
Syaug said heavy clearing equipment would be needed for the quake and tsunami area quickly.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed in a Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into troublemakers' hands in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact information was leaked due to shortcomings in the app's encryption.
The troublemakers had access to ministers' phone numbers, among other things.
This was an application used at the British Conservative Party convention in government.
For example, Brexit was driven by Environment, Food and Rural Minister Michael Gove and former Secretary of State Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of encryption in the app, the public had access to the profiles of politicians who were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The audience had access to profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
Your profile will be able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to change Boris Johnson's profile photo to a porn photo and title insult for a moment.
Michael Goven's profile picture was changed to media mogul Rupert Murdoch's photo.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log in to other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the loginer can view the contact information of the profile person and, for example, send messages in his name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
A Conservative party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority (ICO) is supporting the leak.
The application was prepared by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, there are a large number of applaudable Poles in the audience of The Wall Finland quiz
Accurate-eyed viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland quiz show.
The US format The Wall, which spread rapidly worldwide, landed in Finland version on Four last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen has been filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The possibilities for filming in the Polish studio were exceptional, as the large 12-metre-high game wall of the format required space from the farm.
During the start period, a studio audience of the program was highlighted on social media, which was guessed Polish.
On Twitter, there was a debate about whether Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finnish.
The head of the four domestic programs, Unne Sormunen, illustrates the matter to Iltalehti.
He says that the studio audience has close, other Finnish expatriates living in Poland and only Polish spectators.
The audience consists of international clappers in Finnish production, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes shot in the same production space in other countries.
There are also such groups in Finland, so-called professional audiences, who visit the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen says.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so difficult to understand, even if you do not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green wall-falling balls are easy to distinguish.
However, for foreign-language speakers, interpreters are present in the studio to do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneous interpretation as studio director all the time events.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells what kind of flap there, for example, is thrown and what situation is going on," Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with how David Hasselhoff was recently operating in domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's filming in Finland a few years ago.
He was always replaced by simultaneous interpretation and knew everything that was said on the set in Finnish, Sormunen sums up.
Typhoon sulking in southern Japan moves towards main islands - authorities warn of landslides and floods
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and there are no known deaths so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters, and electricity has been cut off from more than 300,000 households.
More than 1,000 flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are stagnant in some places due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka around noon Finnish time.
Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also strong winds and rains.
Train services have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
Weather scientists say Trami will torment Japan until Monday.
The sky of the Aces was darkened even more
The early season of the Aces has been bad.
The sky was darkened to almost pitch black when the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) on Saturday at their home ground to Vaasan Sport.
The Pori people now have five consecutive losses, and there are a total of two points for six rounds.
No Ace defender or two lower chains player has scored yet.
Pressures are also growing all the time.
The audience was already out of the hall when there was almost half of the game left.
Six games are just played, and of course there is no reason to give up here.
Of course, we have to be worried, because that's how weakly we played.
Especially the second round performance was shamefully bad, Jarno Kärki, who made the power 1+2 for Äss, said.
The sport naturally tasted like a win.
The team had a game below on Friday, so it would have thought it would be visible in the making.
Maybe it did, but Aces couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to increase
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders about the audience of the event in the grand hall stands.
Somehow you thought that maybe not this much people would come this year, Hyvärinen ponders in the morning.
In autumn 2017, the Finnish Traktorikynnö SM-competitions were held simultaneously with Bread Day, so perhaps there would be expectations that the audience could even slightly decrease from the previous year.
However, it was different; the corridors were already blocked by ten, sellers reported that the products had run out, news porridge was sold for nearly 500 servings, and even in the number of cars Hyvärinen heard there was an increase.
The estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the afternoon.
The five hours of the morning and afternoon accommodated a particularly large number of programs for families with children, which I think attracted them to a record number of places.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
Sellers also curve to Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred presenters, sellers of crafts, pastries and harvest products, had arrived at the breadkeeper.
The mother of Bread Day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience from the hall stands.
At the beginning of the day of the bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, the beautiful bread of Teija Kiviniemi won the public vote.
11 different shapes of bread arrived at the children's bread competition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in a martto pie shop.
7 x the most beautiful lamp - here you can recognize a good lamp
Bring the space back to life, create the right mood for the interior, and read the book without fatigue.
Good lighting is worth investing in.
We gathered three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokiniemi, Sales and Marketing Director at Innolux.
Do your eyes a favor
The importance of lighting is growing the more years behind it.
Sufficient light can help with the problems that come to many with age as the accuracy of vision decreases and more people suffer from glare.
As we get older, the need for light also increases.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
It is therefore worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the characteristics of the lamp for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but does not dazzle, Jokiniemi hints.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful interior can only be displayed with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of the moment can afford to choose.
The popularity has a gestureless, Scandinavian and Japanese-connecting Japanese style.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70s, with its strong colours, different shades of metal or ice cream colors, has also risen to boom.
Authenticity fascinates in the same way as in other interiors of the home.
Materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Express Your Personality
On the other hand, more is being invested in the home now than before, and the interior has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a customized, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products, the origin and designer of which are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
It is not necessarily the latest trend lamp that is purchased at home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain timeless, jewelry-like and elegant classics hold out year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to a Canadian attacker after three games
The roads of Koo Koo and striker Brendan O'Donnell separate.
The Canadian attacker played a total of three League games without power points in the orange black, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell moved to KooKoo in August with a one-year contract, which included a trial period lasting until the end of September.
Last season, a 26-year-old striker played in the KHL in the ranks of Kunlund Red Star and and in the KHL farm in the VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
O'Donnell's new club is not yet known.
The player wants to lead by example in recycling - goods go out into the world in recycling boxes, plastic changed to paper
The game's specialty store Pelimies now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the brick-and-mortar store customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from the online store are packaged in packaging from importers, for example.
All packages that come to us go for reuse.
We may use the boxes a dozen times, as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used," Ville Puurula of Oulu's Gaming Man says.
As a soft material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled material.
Bubble plastic is avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are also supposed to move to recycled material in envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
Recycling is not an extra effort, according to Puurula.
It's not a big problem to start recycling.
It also has financial savings when, for example, cardboard packaging is reused.
Recycling is a natural fit for the operations of the Player, as in addition to new products, the key product range of the store includes, among other things, the games and equipment used.
Buying every fashion conscious one: One and the same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothing works from season to season in a costume like a costume.
They create a good gardenerob with their versatility, as it is easy to assemble different outfits around high-quality classics at a low cost.
In the autumn, the most used classics in the wardrobe are high-quality knitwear.
This category also includes black polo.
Black knit made of natural material with polo collars cannot have an error purchase.
The garment can be combined with straight pants, tulle skirts and jeans, and you can create both a restrained outfit and a snotty style around it.
The polo knit is suitable for both the youthfully modern dresser and the classically sophisticated style artist.
This is how you create style.
The autumn trend look is created from golden brown and wide-legged corduroy pants, black polo knitwear and gray ankle boots.
The classic polo knit, along with other classics, the blue-green Scots screen skirt and burgundy loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated ensemble.
Bring edge to the black polo knit by combining it with casually trendy clothing: denim skirt, high boots and thick tights.
Young and elegant!
Russian intelligence sabotage has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign intelligence SVR or military intelligence GRU has abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, sabotage was specialized in so-called DRG groups.
The name comes from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaya gruppa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The KGB agents in the West prepare detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says Vasili Mitroh, archivist who defected west of the KGB (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books in the late 1990s and early 2000s
The sites included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipeline connections.
In Germany, the KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for the DRG groups for covert operations by the Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and road workers.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they wore local Ukrainian police riot gear, established checkpoints from the peninsula to roads leading to Ukraine, and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
Cold War agents hid supply kits with mines, explosives, detonators and means of communication for sabotage groups.
As recently as 1998, a KGB cache was found in Switzerland, with a trap minet exploded when it was sprayed with a water cannon by authorities.
Police reached four drunk drivers in the province at night
Police caught four drunk drivers across North Karelia on the night between Friday and Saturday.
In Joensuu, an 18-year-old man from Kontiolahti blew 1.57 per mille.
He drove two passengers at the beginning of Kajaanintie at half past four in the night.
On the Kuorevaarantie in Polvijärvi, the car derailed at four oja at night, and a 19-year-old local man in the car alone blew 1.54 per mil, according to police.
There were no serious injuries to him in the exit.
In the centre of Outokumpu, a 20-year-old foreign-seat man who drove a passenger car blew 1.33 per mil into an alcometer.
Police suspect those male drivers of aggravated drunk driving and the driver of Polvijärvi, in addition, of endangering road safety.
On Saturday morning, a 36-year-old man carrying a local van at the intersection of Öllöläntie and Hoikantie in Tuupovaara blew 0.52 per mil.
He is suspected of drunk driving.
Police are requesting observations of the stabbing at Turku railway station after midnight.
Police said the man was beaten in the parking lot in front of the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was recorded on a surveillance camera.
Dark hair suspects dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets left immediately after stabbing in a dark station wagon towards the Ratapihankatu bus station.
One suspect took a bicycle off Humalistonkatu in the direction of the city centre.
Pedestrian killed after being hit by bus in Pori
In Pori, a pedestrian died early Saturday morning after a bus crashed into him.
The accident occurred after 4 a.m. on Raumantie at Nituma.
The bus driver is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events that led to the accident.
HPK keeps Riska in line for the rest of the season, Lehtinen's probationary period ended
Mika Toivola, HPK Sports Director at Hämeenlinna, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in starting, underpower gaming and defending the fourth field.
Filip Riska, who played in early autumn, will continue in the HPK in Hämeenlinna for the rest of the season.
The success of experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the club management.
Philip has been an important piece for us in the beginnings, underpower gaming and the defensive role of field four.
Although there is still room for improvement, it is good for the young team to hold on to the player who has experienced it," Mika Toivola, HPK's sports director, said in a statement.
According to Toivola, the value of Riska rises when playing ice hockey League solution games.
Riska, a central attacker from Pietarsaari, has played league hockey in JYP, Luko and Sport before.
Oskari Lehtinen, the winger, was left without a contract after the probationary period.
True story on TV today: Climber left to die twice
Beck Weathers, an American, wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
Tonight's film is made based on them.
Everest is now premiered on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 guidance is about a survival battle that has been handled grainily.
Tragedy has been made into movies and documentaries before.
Real events are also being discussed in this case.
22 years ago, the highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced leaders of expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life could have been saved by eye surgery carried out before leaving for Nepal.
As a result of that and the air pressure, he lost sight, which was why the conquest of the peak had to be missed.
Rob Hall kept going and never came back.
Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he got lost and couldn't find his way back to camp.
When the man was sought, he was found in such bad condition that survival was not entrusted.
Weathers was left to die.
But miraculously, he still got back on his feet and found the others.
Weathers, who was badly frozen, was thought to be still dying and once again left to his own devices.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of being given help.
Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200-year-old Eno Church.
Eno's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today on church hill.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and a celebration of the whole family was prepared for Sunday to celebrate the anniversary.
The celebrations began at 10 a.m. on Eno Church Hill at the family fair, after which there have been offerings from the Karelian banquet table at Eno Parish House.
The church was full.
517 people participated in the family fair.
Eno's vicar Armi Rautavuori was glad that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, Rautavuori (pictured) says.
Many have been touched by the fire of the church of the fastening danger, and it was not ignored at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
Eno Church is now the oldest in the Evangelical Lutheran parishes of Joensuu after the destruction of Kiihtelysvaara Church in a fire.
The wood church of Kiihtelysvaara was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a devotion was held in the risk of acceleration, which silenced and recalled the church destroyed by the fire.
Photos and videos: Medican flashed power in Greece - Sea disappeared and street turned into river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm rolled from lunch to Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, is named Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete regions.
The photos taken from the area show plenty of flooding across Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kiato in the Corinthian region instead of the street due to flooding.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong wind caused strong seafaring.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens instructs people on their Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy calls for monitoring of weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medicane, brings heavy rains and even a flood hazard.
According to a 2011 study published on CNN, medicans occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically around September and October, as sea temperatures are still high.
The storm that is now blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey north and towards Europe.
Concerns in Greece have also been caused by refugee camps on islands such as Lesbos.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
The storm also leaves areas destroyed by wildfires around Athens in the summer.
A medican also raged in Greece last November.
No one should go to sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently on vacation on the Greek islands threatened by autumn storm
Trips to the sea are cancelled and even when walking, you should be careful not to fly branches or other bulk on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed by guides to over 3,500 Finns on holiday in Greece via Sun Trips over the weekend.
Instructions are needed, as even the hurricane storm Zorbas is predicted to beat up the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speed can rise in gusts to up to 45 metres per second.
The weather's wretchedness is enhanced by heavy rains.
Everyone who has travelled to Greece via Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland and has reported their phone number has been warned of strong winds by SMS, according to tour operators.
Still sun and heat in the air
According to Inka Ikonen, a solar communications expert, the worst has been avoided in resorts by the early evening on Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we are monitoring the situation all the time.
Safety ahead.
Tui media stopper Antonia Schroderus says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are in constant contact with our staff at the destination.
At least it was still peaceful in Crete, he told me on Saturday early evening.
The aid currently has a total of over 1,500 Finnish passengers on the most popular Greek islands, namely Rhodes and Crete.
In addition, a few hundred passengers vacation in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kos Island is expected to reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had also scoffed the sun and the temperature climbed to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of Sun Trips.
Zorbas is estimated to become the next Turkish nuisance, though slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui, for example," Schroderus says.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss have identical evening dresses in the Miss Finals - this is how they react to the situation
Media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in a generous evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me a great dress for tonight.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by host Shirly Karvinen.
The two also noticed their similar outfits and took the situation with a laugh.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat he was in a hurry to prepare, and he had to put himself on a plane.
Hussi is a backstage and red carpet host in the Miss Finals, and she talks to the front-row stars who arrive.
Huss has a recent move behind him, as he moved from Kamppi to Jätkäsaari on Friday
I'm going to stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi vacationed alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was just at the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress broke out, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful," Hussi says.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention - garnered curious looks from pensioners
The host and the 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final on the red carpet that she had enough to do with radio plots and Love Island Finland photography.
There has been enough haste even to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the finals directly from Finnair's flight.
I made and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
Changing the evening dress at home, Karvinen laughs.
Garfield says he pulled his makeup out in the midst of pensioners.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow passengers.
I had a big mirror and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was amusing, at least to others.
Garfield flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his job as a host of Love Island Finland.
He also describes his experience as being stopping so far.
Karvinen says he went to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's really raw in some way.
They are people's true emotions, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles in the program.
How do I put on overgenerational boots?
Three Perfect Example Costumes
Classic clothing is a piece of clothing that works from season to season in a costume like a costume.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes even more modern individuals can be included.
A few years ago, overgenerational boots, which became hit shoes for the fall and winter season, have not gone anywhere.
As its name suggests, boots over the knee are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
The impressive boots share the opinions of the users, but the bold model is worth a try, well - boldly.
Overgenerational boots are actually suitable for any kind of outfit.
Whether it's a jeans, lace, tulle or tricot, the simple leather or fake leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in both party looks and everyday outfits.
Black over-generational boots are well suited for gentle outfits.
They suitably balance the femininity of a pink, flowery plexer skirt and a tender, plush knitwear.
Fresh but autumny stylish everyday outfit for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-spirited outfit is created from a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-generational boots, spectacular earrings and rivet little bag.
Although overgenerational boots have a certain sophistication, they also fit perfectly into a casual everyday outfit along with a t-shirt, long shorts and a trendy cap.
Wonderfully easy and yet so elegant!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and pick up passengers, the City of Espoo reports.
Otaniemi robot cars will play the role of a bus simulator, as next spring the area is scheduled to start traffic by robot bus.
The project develops and pilots year-round robotic vehicle traffic and tests the technical functionality of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how robotic cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment," says Johanna Nyberg, Traffic Management Manager.
For the first time, robotic cars run completely automatically among other traffic without special traffic arrangements.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of the auxiliary passenger on board.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether the driveway is free.
If not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or snowflake are detected, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robotic cars run throughout the autumn three days a week: on Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30, on Wednesdays from 10-15 am and on Thursdays from 10-15 pm.
Robotic cars stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
Robot car stops are identified by stop markings.
The most secure ride is from stop number 1 in Otakaari.
The bassist of Mokoma fell off stage in the middle of the show and was injured
Mokoma band informs about the surprising situation on their Facebook page at the Tampere Pakkahuone gig.
The Mokoma band's gig at Tampere Pakkahuone took a dramatic turn on Saturday when band bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off stage in the middle of the performance.
The situation occurred when the band was pulling the last song of the evening.
The Hämäläinen wrist was broken.
The band will inform you on their Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santtu tripped off the stage at Pakkahuone yesterday in the last song and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a quick recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour's gigs are done by backup occupation, the website says.
Mokoma fans are concerned about the photo update, where the bassist-Santtu is lying with a plaster in his hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, there was a lot of concern about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones heal fortunately over time.
Cheers and a quick recovery to Santtu and a good tour for the rest of the band plus a replacement!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great gig, but you promise to leave out such a strong drama about the end of gigs in the future? writes a fan.
Police oversee hunting in North Karelia and Savo
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish Game Centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, the police department's wilderness contact persons reported on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the supervision was on the legality and licensing of hunting.
Each hunter was checked with a hunting card and a hunting permit required on state lands.
In addition, the possession permits for hunting weapons and the permitted number of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in chicken birding were checked.
Police said 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, lacking the required hunting permit.
Twelve daily fines were imposed on the hunter for unauthorised fishing.
In addition, 133 vehicle drivers were blown by police, and two of them are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in a fine procedure, police times.
In conclusion, hunters follow the permission of hunting very well.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter stated that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (co.) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees coming to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from refugee camps in Turkey to Finland this year.
Selection trips are usually made a couple of times a year, and representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police are involved.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) first selects particularly vulnerable people.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly distressed position in refugee camps, for example single-parent families, disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group coming to Finland than there are in the quota, because in practice some people are not arriving for various reasons.
Mykkänen will also meet with NGOs on the Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman Soylu and the Syrian border on his trip.
Ilkka Salmi, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved.
Talk about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but no agreement has since been reached in the government to raise it.
The Coalition Party has supported a quota increase, but the project has last fallen into blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed to gradually increase the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen's visit during this government term is the first one that the Minister of the Interior will make on the ground to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The previous interior ministers Petteri Orpo (co.) and Paula Risikko (co.) had time to move on to their new duties before the visits were arranged.
Finland receives €10,000 in support from the EU for every particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go get beat up - you don't know if you're crying or laughing anymore
Last Saturday, Karjalainen reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article gave the impression that the bill, in principle, prohibits the keeping of all animals not specifically permitted by ministerial regulations in relation to farm animals, pets or otherwise business.
So everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals mentioned separately in the regulation.
If the bill ends up in law, it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good practice.
Now, in principle, a ban on any activity that is not specifically authorised by law or regulation is being enacted.
The change causes nothing new to be tried, for example, in business or to do anything else until a law or regulation that accepts it has been passed.
The government's activities in the drafting of the law in general have been weak.
If we go down the road now that, in principle, everything in Finland is forbidden, which is not allowed separately, you no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I have no doubt that the Animal Welfare Act requires an update.
But a law project along these lines is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a 'everything is prohibited, which is not specifically permitted by law or regulation' procedure.
Hopefully there will be some sensible minister who will interrupt the progress of such a legal project.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be charged in case of storm
The Zorba storm that blew in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen and farmers on Saturday, especially on the west coast of the country, about the Greek storm, writes CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency officials on Saturday evening urged citizens to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure the functionality of the internet connection so that people can receive current situation updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi said.
People have been urged to stay at home and away from the windows, and to move garden furniture away from the wind, for example.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and wind is expected to blow 28-33 metres per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to the areas of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete in southern Greece.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and travel agencies organising trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the storm Zorba.
The Embassy of Finland in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather reports and instructions from local authorities.
Not long ago, when I contacted you, there was a strong wind and it rained.
People were calm, communications manager Laura Aaltonen from Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By the evening, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had also not received messages from Finns in need.
In Greece, ships did not operate in several ports on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
Boat trips to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, reported from travel agencies to STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected to air and shipping.
Finnair was announced on Saturday that the weather situation will be actively monitored.
Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reason for Mercedes' superiority over Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen was able to admit that Mercedes, the worst competitor, was too hard a piece in the Russian GP's qualifying.
However, there is no reason to sink into panic in Ferrari camp, an experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in qualifying all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourth driven and clearly left behind by their teammate Sebastian Vettel from the Mercedes speed said.
Ferrari was already having a hard time in the previous race in Singapore.
The rapper was asked what the sudden fall from Mercedes' ride was.
They seem to be going faster than we do - that's how simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go at the same speed as them.
But I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is a constant guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
The times saw a rare treat for Sauber in the upcoming stable of Räikkönen.
Charles Leclerc, the replacement for Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time trial.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth starting position is the best in over three years.
And although as many as five drivers did not drive completely in the second driving session, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for the future?
Yes, if you compare where they were in the early part of the season, then the step forward has been big.
There will be a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius knocked out Erka Teper: "Robbe is back"
Robert Helenius and Erka Teper's match at Stuttgart evening proceeded on a steady note.
The German was a more proactive party in the ring, but he couldn't get a proper hit.
Clearly, Helenius controls the match with his tough series, which found their way well.
The Finn was also in clearly better physical condition than Teper.
The solution eventually came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked out Teper on his left straight.
The hit was so hard that the veteran who fought in front of the home audience didn't even try to get out of the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius ventilated quite moderately.
In a ring interview, he initially praised the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he changed his language to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was delighted immediately after the match.
It was a really big win for Helenius' career.
There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup game," Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
The loss, on the other hand, might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's crossed my mind.
It won't be any younger here, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
Indonesia disaster victims could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president urges us to prepare for a clear rise in the death toll.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could reach thousands.
Difficult conditions
Rescuers are looking for trapped and also dead in the most affected areas of Sulawes Island: the port city of Palu and its neighboring municipality Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Pilus, there is no clarity about Donggala's situation yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the oppressed buildings that rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
Rescuers say they heard the screams of people trapped in the ruins, but the lack of clearance equipment has delayed the start of rescue work.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered military rescue and clearance work.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications connections are cut off in many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland finalist's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäs Ruukki is currently choosing a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, a question was asked to each miscifinalist.
The finalists pulled the question of a glass bowl on stage.
Especially the hesitant response of finalist number six Emilia Anttikoski, 23, caused sweet but benevolent laughs in the audience present.
The question asked to Anttikoski had come through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what the latest book has been read by a misfinalist.
Anttikoski thought about his answer for a good time before starting with hesitation.
Thanks for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The latest book I have read is..., Anttikoski said, thinking.
The reflection break caused a laugh in the audience until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I have read books at school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I have read is economics someone," Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud round of applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Previously, on the Miss Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention, as she did not want to pose in underwear because of her principle.
Miss Finland of 2018 will be crowned at 9 p.m. when the crown is abandoned last year's Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
Sike's apple pear cake takes the tongue with it
This recipe is for you who have good, sour apples from behind, as the domestic apple is shockingly priced in the store.
A pear may have to be bought, although quite a few people already have that pear tree growing.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you don't want to buy pear.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake is also invested in its pear.
Peel the apples and pear and remove the seed pods.
Slice.
You can melt in a saucepan.
Beat the eggs and sugar into foam, then add corn flour and molten butter to the foam.
Combine corn starch, or maizena, and baking powder and add them to the dough as well.
Add almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line the bread casserole with baking paper, sprinkle 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the pan and apply pear slices over the sugar.
Spoon half the dough over the pear slices and apple blocks over the dough.
Spoon the end of the dough on top of the apple blocks.
Cook in the oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautiful brown.
Let cool in the pan and then undo the serving platter.
Cut the cake only properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crumbs because the dough contains almond and corn flour without gluten.
Ruka will host an international criminal literature event in January
An international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime literature will be held at Kuusamo Ruka in January for the first time.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers, as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include Swedish detective literature star Jens Lapidus and Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson behind the Erik Axel Sund writer name and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to Swedish names, the event also features writer guests from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival organizers, the northern location, nature, dark season and Kuusamo's unique environment provide a framework for a unique written experience.
Status symbols don't attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analyzed the issue, have outlined two species of "coolness" of slightly different traits: the generally attractive coolness and the partly opposite dissident-coolness.
Charmingly cool people, according to researchers, had many features that were considered socially desirable: outgoing, friendly, harmonious, and competent.
Dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and edge.
They were thirsty for experience and cared little about outsider reviews.
Both types were combined with good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The role of Kovis in the long run is not cool: high status in teens may not lead to success later in life.
This is what a 2014 U.S. study published in Child Development reports.
Young people who dated early partyed, sought out groups of good-looking people, and sought the popularity of others had an increased risk of using drugs and committing crimes as young adults.
In their relationships, they did less than their once more unobtrusive peers.
High-status cars, marker bags, or watches don't make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more prepared to make friends with people wearing a regular supermarket shirt than with those wearing a branded shirt - despite the fact that most people chose to wear a brand shirt in the event of getting to know each other.
If you are in the Greek holiday islands, beware!
There's a hurricane hitting there - weather warning screaming red
During the weekend, as much water can rain in southern Greece as in Finland over an average of six months.
Zorbas hurricane strikes Greece over the weekend.
Be prepared for it if you are staying in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades or Crete region.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
According to the ambassador, the Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the areas.
The approaching storm is also reported on the Foreca blog of the weather service.
It says the storm's toughest gusts are up to 45 meters per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm, which beat Finland early in the week, blew well over 31 metres per second.
However, according to the blog, the main concern of storm Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than 300 millimeters of water can come in southern Greece.
It accounts for about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa, the weather service, has shared a video of the storm developing on its Facebook page.
Storm Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the men drooling Love Island Finland Anku?
Appears in confusing Youtube videos
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beauty Anku, drooled by several men, also appears as a craft aunt in strange YouTube videos released in 2010.
In the videos, Anku advises craftsmen to, among other things, make an octopus from an old paper roll.
The duck also shows in its sympathetic style how to craft a hedgehog from tights, which grows into the right spikes.
Now let's make Easter grasses grow, but let's do it a little surprisingly, Anku hints and presents sawdust, tights and ravine seeds, which he makes a hedgehog out of.
You can watch videos below or on Anku's Youtube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shook and burst adrenaline in Sochi - will he be Hamilton's helper on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas shook for a little more tens of minutes after his Russian GP pole position run while he was in front of the media.
A fine tour left Mercedes' number one star Lewis Hamilton behind and was certainly a mentally important criticism for the Finnish driver who gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he dropped out of the round of decisions.
It feels good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas explained.
I have only been on the pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good laps again.
It is not easy to pass on Sochi's track, so the output plays a particularly big role.
And of course Bottas was allowed to answer the curious whether he would be driving tomorrow for a win or if Hamilton, who was approaching the World Cup title, was in front of him.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas piled.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' leadership at Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas supplemented.
Hamilton was genuinely delighted with Bottas' success after the drive, and the taste was good for Mercedes' stable boss Toto Wolff as well.
Lewis had the intention of winning Valtteri, but he failed in seven bends.
Valtteri knows he has to rip everything out of himself to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline burst out of his ears," Wolff said.
To the question of whether the team will let Bottas and Hamilton drive fairly, Wolff replied dodgingly.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race leaves.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars ended unusually.
Hardly ever before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
Now it was done by Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburgen, who were driven around Turku and Salo, because Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee ensured the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him with the Finnish Championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä, who competes at Honda Civic, started the Turku competition with moderation because the starting points were clear: the ranking in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the two had to give handicaps when some of the additional lights failed with another special test.
It was a time blind to a third clip.
In a situation like that, it's not a good idea to get drunk.
On Saturday, only the second Jussi Tepo in the series was followed, Kinnunen said.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey to withdraw troops
Syria's foreign minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "almost over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a Syria meeting was planned for October, with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey participating in her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court judge drama on TV
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a professor who accuses her of harassment, got an exceptionally large number of people around the screens.
In the United States, a full-power Supreme Court judge's nomination drama brought at least 20 million people to their televisions on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and California professor Blasey Ford, who accuses him of harassment, were in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell his story.
Initial results show that the hearings were followed by a total of 20.4 million viewers on six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to them, several million more were followed by online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the live streams and CNN reported that it had set its record for the year with 8.2 million live broadcast starts.
CNN's figure rises to over $10 million, including those who followed the broadcast via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million startups.
Digital startups are channels' own, TV viewer figures come from research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will release the final readings on Monday, but they are dizzy anyway.
Few reach 20 million
In the United States, more than 20 million ratings are usually only available for sports matches, as well as the major Oscars and Grammys in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and also presidential debates in 2016.
The most annual watchable program in the United States, the American Football League NFL Final Game, is certainly a long way to go to the Super Bowl.
This year, the Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and the inauguration by over 30 million people.
A top-notch issue
The Supreme Court's appointment is an extremely significant case in the United States, as the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor to him.
The second place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year that he would retire.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues he was a so-called scale language, the voice of which could determine the position of a nine-person court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minority rights and, for example, in 2015, ruled that same-sex people were granted the right to marry throughout the federal government.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His election to the Supreme Court may lock the court in for decades of conservative superiority.
Children have the right to receive their information to parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the situation of the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even look at the health information or recipes of infants.
A temporary correction was made to the situation in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing amount of time to correct.
Now the repair is expected - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a through-call thing.
After that, the layman's understanding is about pressing a button: now that the wire is held, it is opened.
Of course, a child can show their information to their parents if they have bank codes or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do?
The ID card is paid, and the 10-year-old does not even get bank IDs.
In practice, therefore, no one can see the information of a grade four in primary school except by asking for it printed.
It is not so much a question of parental law as of the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents can be involved.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations where not all things can be freely talked about.
Often they are related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply relevant human right.
In the United States, the FBI began to serve off allegations of harassment against Kavanaugh
According to U.S. media, the FBI is investigating allegations of harassment by at least two women.
One of the women was heard by the Senate Legal Committee earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
US President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to settle the allegations at the request of the Senate Justice Committee.
The report must not last more than a week.
The Washington Post says it is a more limited report than criminal investigation and may not become public.
Man threatens to kill police officers at police station in Kajaani
The captured brawler continued to bulge even at the chamber.
Police say they put the man in police prison to "crush".
Police were threatened by a suspected assaulter on the night against Saturday in Kajaani.
The authorities report a case that began when a man over 30 years of age fiercely challenged a dispute at a downtown restaurant.
The man first assaulted another client within the nutrition store.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by knocking him down.
When the third party intervened, the man still hit him.
The triple abuse led to the police being called.
The patrol caught the man and took Kajaani to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they sent the man to a police prison to "crush".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition to the official.
Aid agencies prepare to start work at Sulawes, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent"
UNICEF and other international aid organisations are ready to help on the Indonesian island of Sulawes, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF's Head of Information for Finland.
Local authorities are in charge of rescue work, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF always has full emergency response capability, says Haru.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue efforts are underway in the city of Palu, Sulawes, but the situation is less clear in the Donggala area a little further north.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Assistance is difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawes are often lightweight, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors are found, they will need shelter - at first, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people can most often be offered water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported at first, for example, in trucks.
In crisis situations, many children are separated from their parents.
Searching for family members and family reunification is one part of UNICEF's mission field.
Food aid is organised by the World Food Programme (WFP), which is part of the UN.
In the initial phase, previously raised funds will be used for emergency aid.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already begun a fundraising to help the victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends Tesla as chairman of the board of directors with $20 million fines for tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies that manufacture space rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the U.S. Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends his position as chairman of the board of directors of the electric car company Tesla and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk resigns as part of a contract he entered into with the U.S. Securities Market Supervisory Authority.
By agreeing Musk avoids fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud due to tweets he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he is preparing to withdraw the electric car company Tesla from the stock exchange, which caused the company's stock price to rise rapidly.
The deal states that Musk will not be allowed to serve as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
Tesla must also appoint a new "independent member" to its board and take two "independent leaders" to its management team.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk is still allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal $20 million fines, Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million to the financial supervisor.
Tweets misled investors
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private limited liability company.
Billionaire tweets say the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla's stock price rose by more than ten percent in a day after tweets, but later fell.
The SEC said Musk's claims had no basis at all.
The supervisor said he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He had also not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the rest of the management team or the company's board of directors.
On Friday this week, the rate dropped by 14% when the SEC reported a fraud charge.
The news agreement is expected to strengthen the company's course again.
The last sentence is not the reason
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical failure.
The clock of the Tower of Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point at 12 o'clock.
It's like a mediocre horror movie: even when there's an exorcism from the church crypt and the organ would ring on its own.
This is not the case, of course, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it has broken.
It has been visited by a repairman, but some parts have broken and a new part is expected to do so," says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the point already mentioned in the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account mentions that the last sentence is not the reason for the clock to stop.
Jamsen says the church bells don't ring because of the fault.
