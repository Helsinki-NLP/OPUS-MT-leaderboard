Welsh Representative Council members fear looking like fools
Some members of the Representative Council are confused by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, i.e. Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The controversy began with a plan to change the name of the Representative Council to the Welsh Parliament.
Regardless of the party position, members of the Representative Council are concerned that the change may make them ridiculed.
According to a Labour spokesman, the group is concerned that the name "crimes with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the majority of the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a representative of the Conservative Party, his group is "open-minded" about the name change, but points out that there is a short verbal leap from the word MWP to the word stupid.
In Welsh, the letter w is pronounced in this context in a similar way to the English u letter of Yorkshire.
The Representative Council Commission, which is currently drafting a legislative amendment to the name change, stated: "The final decision on the titles describing the members of the Representative Council will of course belong to the members themselves."
The Welsh Administration Act 2017 gives the Representative Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion poll on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a representative council as a Parliament in Wales enjoys broad support.
The Commission favoured Welsh parliamentarians or the abbreviation WMP as the title of members of the Representative Council, but the MWP option received the most support in a public opinion poll.
Members of the Representative Council apparently propose alternative titles, but lack of consensus can cause a headache for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to have a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments contains other changes to the activities of the Representative Council, such as rules on the loss of mandate and the form of the Committee system.
In the legislative process, members of the Representative Council can give their final vote on what title they should be called.
Macedonians go to ballot box in referendum on changing country name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum aims to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long reiterated that the North Neighbor's name is in practice a territorial requirement for its belonging territory, and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martins' clocks slow down as Harlem churches live through difficult times
"The elderly people I've talked to say that there used to be a bar or church in every corner of the street," says Adams.
"There is neither today."
He said losing bars is understandable.
He said that "People's dealings have changed."
"Bars are no longer the living rooms shared by the neighborhood, where people meet regularly."
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the sale of property will not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they will have returned to square one."
He added that churches can be replaced by residential houses and apartments that are not inhabited by people who would support the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"The more people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus will hasten the day these churches close their doors once and for all, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a decade later.
The original White Methodist Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black congregation acquired the building.
St Martins was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th Street merchants on Harlem's central shopping street for their opposed hiring or promotion of black people.
The fire that broke out in 1939 severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners were planning to rebuild, they introduced a tower clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martins, proudly called the tower clock game "poor clocks."
An expert who played the tower watch game in July called it another name: "cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first tower bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell game for Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martins did not replace him.
In St. Martins, a complex skewer has developed in recent months, partly involving architects and contractors hired by church lay leaders and by the Episcopal diocese.
Sakasti - a governing body of lay leaders in the parish - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would "try to roll the costs" to the sacristy, even though the sacristy had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of lack of transparency in the diocese.
Shark harms 13-year-old lobster diver in California
Authorities say the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him as the boy dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before 7:00 a.m.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and a group of others paddled to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought at first that the boy was just excited to catch the lobster, but then realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!'
When Hammel gets to the boy, he says he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
"I yelled at everyone to leave the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The species of attacked shark is unknown.
Lifeguard captain Larry Giles said at a media event that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches in Ponto Beach, Casablad, to Swam, Ecinitas, for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams in department store-style beauty departments serving expert advisors.
This is a major movement for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow, despite the weakening of sales of fashion and household goods. Larger beauty departments will be tried in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be expanded to other stores next year.
Beauty products are placed because supermarkets tend to fill shelf space previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury's says its beauty product range will double to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and get their own brand-specific areas like Boots stores.
Supermarket will also re-launch its Boutique makeup selection. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan friendly, as young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop perfume chain is experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the shift of grocery purchases to small one-time purchases in local stores force supermarkets to come up with new lures for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look even more like department stores as the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habitat stores. The company says this promoted food sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to share the proceeds of pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows a acquisition in which Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, which owns its pharmacy business, Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of luxurious skin care products to four stores with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty departments to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in special training employees who are willing to advise customers.
Our range of brands meets all needs and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us a convincing beauty shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Peter Jones "enraged" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million contract
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "in rage" when TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from £11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The two companies have been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute. She now plans to focus on her new giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "enraged" at last Tuesday's tense meeting at Jones' business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinhamshire. The TV star girl had admitted that her new £1.5 million contract would not leave enough time for their home supplies and accessories brand Truly.
The company has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand and was guessed to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was Holly's clearly most important project.
It was his long-term plan, which was to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His departure decision has left everyone in amazement.
No one could believe Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlow's headquarters have a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold."
This Morning host is one of Britain's most reliable stars, and experts say his departure can cause millions in losses to the company due to product investments, which include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to household items, not to mention delaying the release.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for about ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones took over as president in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being baked into M&S' new brand ambassador and replaces Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source near Jones said the night before, "We won't comment on his business."
Tough talk and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comment, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his positiveness towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said he was pretending to be the voice of a "news anchor."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had praised the first July meeting as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Nuclear weapons negotiations have been stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "equivalent reaction" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
He said the United States would instead continue its sanctions, which are intended to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have such an excellent relationship."
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. Missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been helped to freedom, and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual style when he talked about his relationships with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out into this crowded hall 10,000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing directly at the audience in front of us.
Indonesia tsunami and quake destroy island, hundreds of dead
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told they were not needed.
The national emergency required for international aid was not declared, although about 10% of Lombok's residents had been left homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children forms the Return traveling group, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities would assess Palu's situation to see if international organizations were allowed to participate in the relief work.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the regular earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The burn likely lost lives due to the missing tsunami warning siren, although the warning was in place.
Travelling between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging even in the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship assigned to Lombok to help the earthquake victims is en route to Return, but it will take at least three days before it reaches a new accident area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure the center of his election campaign, and he has spewed money to improve roads and railways.
However, either the administration has been plagued by a funding gap, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Either pressure is also increased by tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority of the country has adopted a more conservative form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with machetes, bow guns and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons, which has led to the deaths of more than 1,000 people and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sank a late handicap against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League on Saturday after painting for 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was in a losing position.
He moved the ball to the left before he scooped the shot towards the back post.
The shot floated high over the penalty area towards the top right corner.
Eventually, the ball fell over the throwing Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as much up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch, and I fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match in half 1-0 after Eden Hazard of Belgium painted in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip gave the heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in the situation before spinning away near the midfield and spun Liverpool into the field half.
Kovacic played a fast wall feed on the midfield.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a great pass through.
Hazard escaped from defense and passed Liverpool with Alisson Becker's left foot shot in the back corner.
Liverpool will face Naples on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832 dead
Indonesia's disaster agency reported early Sunday that the number of earthquake and tsunami deaths rose to 832 victims.
Bureau spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings when a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Friday and raised waves up to six metres high.
Fragments of collapsed buildings spread widely to the city of Palu, a population of 380,000.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding woman stabbed to death
A woman's body found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning launched a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking people in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police. They may have information vital to the investigation".
A female police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people who may know the woman have come to the scene of the crime and have asked about where she was found.
As the investigation continues, police say they are trying to inform the victim of what happened.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but police had told him that no one would be allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it could take hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was heard telling the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A tearful woman appeared at the scene.
He repeated that "it's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two huts in the isolated area, and an additional third outside.
There were several police officers in the isolated area who were monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone who knows something is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or call Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 anonymously using ID 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue too became part of the history rewriting plot
The evicting of the statue would be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical Puritan supporters destroyed English cultural and religious memorabilia like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "typerity" and "rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate over the removal of statues would make a target of Oliver Cromwell's statue off Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not command or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
False Cromwell might suffer the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent description of Cromwell embodies 19th-century opinions and is a historical proof of a figure that many still consider worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more so in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a defender of parliament against the external pressure that, of course, was caused by the monarchy in this case.
Whether this is an accurate description of the subject is a subject of constant historical debate.
At least, it is certain that the mid-17th century controversy has shaped the later development of our nation, while Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that distribution.
In addition, his achievements as a state administrator deserve praise and remembrance."
Killer pig sulked Chinese farmer to death
Local media reports that the pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
Only the body of a man identified by his surname "Yuan" was found near the pig farm in Liupanshui Market in Guizhou province. The man's artery was broken and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
The pigherder is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunna Province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs in the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed the door to the nearby pig farm was open.
In the pig, he said he saw a big boar with his mouth in his blood.
According to the news, a forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound boar was sulking to death by a farmer.
Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named "Wu" said that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that it would not harm others when police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs are known to have attacked humans before, although it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kg wedged a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
An Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012. After the event, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can serve as a "trigger".
"They're just playful.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be properly respected," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring widespread heavy rains to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is predicted to weaken as she moves over cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had a windspeed of 38 meters per second, a first-class hurricane, at five o'clock on Sunday morning, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, low pressure is forming over the Pacific, heading east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives on the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push deep tropical moisture north towards the southwestern United States.
Rosa brings up to 250 millimeters of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching low pressure, will form large rainy areas southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of 25-100 millimeters causes dangerous heavy rain floods and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity causes 50-75 mm of rainfall per hour in certain fallout areas, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 50-100 millimeters of rain are expected in certain areas southwest, and especially in Arizona.
Heavy rain floods are possible and conditions can deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
When tropical rain threatens, it is strongly recommended to avoid going into the wilderness on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers and thunderstorms cause local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low pressure area brings local heavy rains to the coastal areas of southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 10 millimeters are possible, causing small waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the area.
Fragmented tropical rain showers begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday until rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and last throughout Wednesday.
In October, strong fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the United States as the Arctic cools down, but with the tropics remaining quite warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations at short distances.
In the central United States, an excellent example of large temperature differences is seen on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, as well as Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines of Iowa.
The lingering heat of the summer will try to intensify and expand again in the next few days.
From the beginning of October, it is expected to be widely warm in the central and eastern United States, with temperatures close to +26 degrees Celsius from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can climb to +26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast shows that there is a good chance of higher than average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh hear
More than 20 million watched a broadcast broadcast broadcast on Tuesday by six television channels, in which Supreme Court justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, gave her fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued as television companies suspended their broadcast at a last-minute turn, according to which the FBI conducts a week-long investigation into the allegations under an agreement organized by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100% sure that the intoxicated Kavanaugh groped him and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, on the other hand, gave an emotional testimony saying he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
There were probably more viewers than the 20.4 million that Nielsen announced on Friday.
The company lowered viewers' average on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Other channels that sent the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring viewers who watch in offices.
Something about the proportions tells us that the reading corresponds to the number of spectators at an American football playoff match or Oscars.
Of all television companies, the highest number of viewers was on Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment. The channel had an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during the hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
Friday's drama was centered on Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed how the protesters' screams escorted him to the elevator on the way to the Justice Committee hearing on Friday, and moderate Republican backup had previously announced he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed me straight how he stood down for minutes with his eyes flying.
"I stand right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe he will tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Flake said his office issued a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to tell after hearing the committee.
Hours later, cable and broadcast networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs began voting to take Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate in the coming week, as the Democrats in the minority have called for.
Flake was convinced to be part of his friend, Democrat Chris Coons, based on his conversations.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of politicising Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her EU withdrawal plans of politics that threatens Britain's future and national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
Next to May's interview, another interview was published on the front page of the newspaper, in which his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson is invited by a proposal that Britain and the EU perpetuate each other's import duties, "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of LSU player's death
Police have arrested a person on suspicion of shooting 20-year-old Wayde Sims who played basketball at LSU.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and the Baton Rouge Police Department says he is charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of Sims and Simpson's showdown, in which police report that Sims lost his glasses.
Police found their glasses at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, WAFB reports.
Police say Simpson admitted to shooting Wayde during interrogations.
According to Advocate magazine, his bail was US$350,000.
A coroner of the municipality of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency thanks the Louisiana State Police Strike Team, the State Police Crime Laboratory, Southern University Police and residents of the area for assisting the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement agencies for their "newsness and justice."
Sims was 20.
The two-metre striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his Wayne father also played basketball at the LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a match last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "terrified" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen," Wayde said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexiko.
On Saturday, the Mexican Disaster Prevention Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as crater operations accelerated and 183 gas and ash eruptions were registered during the day.
The center registers grains and vibrations several times.
Social media released images in residential areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City covered a thin layer of ash with car windshields.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 72 kilometers southwest of the capital since Mexico was shaken by a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona in a confrontation between independence protesters and riot police. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote to split opinions.
Police held back a group of masked independence supporters who threw eggs and powder paint at the police, which formed dark clouds of dust normally on streets filled with tourists.
During the day, more skirmishes broke out as police used their batons to curb the melee.
The clashes between the independenceists and the Unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter "may Spain live".
The local press reports that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries in the demonstrations.
Tension is still on the surface of the independence-friendly region a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declares illegal but is celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by a clear majority, although participation was low with opponents boycotting the vote.
Catalan officials said nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Independent groups stayed outdoors on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the national police.
However, the demonstration was held, but it had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in a separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives."
I saw my parents crying with joy to vote, but now we're stuck in place," he says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory achieved in last December's regional elections, the pace of parties supporting Catalan independence has waned this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or in custody awaiting trial for their involvement in the holding of a referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a pro-police demonstration on her phone, says politicians on both sides fueled the dispute.
"The situation is getting tougher all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in custody since last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European parliamentary elections.
"Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the erosion and repression of democratic values that we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
Men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car was reported to have repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The events proceeded at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, a crossbow could be fired at the car.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston secured victory
Series riser Livingston stunned the Rangers and only caused Steven Gerrard another defeat in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was eventually enough to win as Gary Holt's team rose to split second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew were left without the first guest win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday it will face serial director Hearts, who is eight points ahead.
The Rangers will meet in between in the Rapid Vienna Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continued his lossless streak in the series for six games. Head coach Holt has not lost once since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost seats against a visitor who suffered from lack of blade
Holt's team should have led long before their goal after causing the Rangers serious difficulties with their directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish went wide, and next Alan Lithgow was able to slide in front of the goal to Craig Halkett's but directed the ball past.
The hosts favorably handed over ball control to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate from special situations.
An important goal came just like this.
The Rangers caused Livingston a free kick, from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played a place for Menga to move the ball to the middle of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but found the home team's defenses were holding, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not able to try much.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow directed the ball past one more of Livingston's special situations.
The concentrations that were raining in the Livingston penalty area were constantly cleaned up, and two situations were called for a penalty kick in vain - Halkett's tackled exchange man Glenn Middleton and the ball that hit his hand.
"A great performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent down to every player, continuing through the upswings.
The team's playing style and crew have not changed much since it reached the highest level.However, Holt must be recognized for the way he has strengthened the team since he arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing in leading an excellently organized defense, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked ideas.
The team has performed really well under Gerrard from time to time, but now stayed far from his standards.
The last pass was exhausted, and they only managed to open the home team defense once, and this should serve as a wake-up call for the Rangers, the middle caste of the league table.
Erdogan received varying reception in Cologne
The smile was delicate and the sky blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is intended to correct relations between NATO allies.
There have been disagreements about human rights and freedom of the press, as well as Turkey's EU efforts.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000-headed supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, justifying the issue on security grounds, but a lot of supporters gathered nearby to see the president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also brought their voices to the members, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Competing demonstrations reflect a division of opinions, some of which the German Turk greets him as a hero as others slander him as a autocracy.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred at about 10 a.m. local time in the southwestern part of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which has busy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the nursing staff came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist died in a traffic escape accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident site.
City police say they are trying to identify the man and inform his loved ones.
Roadblocks are present and bus traffic has been diverted. Motorists have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in unrest
Prison officials report six prison guards injured a high-security rating of men in prison unrest.
The unrest began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 on Sunday British time and continues.
Tornado special police officers have been brought in to calm the unrest behind which there are eight prisoners in one prison wing.
Minor face injuries by police were treated at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent to HMP Long Lartin prison to take care of the situation.
Six staff members have been treated for their injuries.
We do not accept violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The warden was reported to have received hospitalization in June after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In addition, riot police were alerted to the prison in October due to serious unrest, where staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of heavy rain floods to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dryness areas can benefit)
Tropical low pressures rarely arrive in Arizona, but that is exactly what will happen early next week as the remains of Hurricane Rosa move over the southwest desert, bringing with them the risk of heavy rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of heavy rain floods during Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern Kaifornia and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to advance directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving Monday in the form of rain.
Phoenix's national weather service remarked in a tweet that only "only ten tropical hurricanes have maintained a tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 65 kilometers off the Arizona border."
The latest modelling at the National Hurricane Center predicts 50-100 millimeters of rain, and in some places, it can rain up to 150 millimeters on the Mogoll ridge in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rock mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 milliliters are likely to be obtained, and it can rain up to 100 millimeters in total.
Rosa's rains can also be a blessing in an area affected by drought if there is no danger of heavy rain floods.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rains can be beneficial because of the severe drought in southern lunch.
According to the U.S. Drought Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest class, weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa first makes an invasion of the California Peninsula in Mexico on her route.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. It is still hurricane strong at 135 kilometers per hour. It moves north at 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm loses its power when it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm strong during Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, rains can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"From the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora, 75-150 millimeters are expected, and up to 250 millimeters is possible," says weather.com.
Rosa then continues her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical low pressure in Tuesday morning hours, where it continues its journey through Arizona to southern Utah by Tuesday's late hours.
"The biggest risks of rose or its remains are likely to be associated with very heavy rains on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Agency said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rain floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning at 4 a.m. British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in a "stable" state.
Police say they arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset during the night.
Police are requesting contact from anyone who may have video footage of events recorded on a mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the Democratic Party's "obviousness and anger"
"Voice Judge Kavanaugh has a voice against the ruthless and shameful methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's "obviousness and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford, which would have occurred decades ago during their teenage years.
Ford also testified of his accusation in the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellence, character, and courage" that day.
"Voice for confirming Judge Kavanaugh's appointment is a vote for one of the most distinguished legal scholars of our time with excellent merit from public service," he told a group of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
Not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest," he said.
"That's why I'm all around to fight for excellent candidates."
Trump claimed the Democrats took on the task of "opposing and preventing."
A senior contributor to the Republican party leadership told CNN that the first important vote in Kavanaugh's nomination procedure is expected to the Senate by Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 dead after a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia, many wiped out with giant waves that hit the shores.
Hundreds of people had gathered at the festival on Friday on the shore of the city of Palu, when waves up to six metres high hit the beach at dusk. Many washed up on their deaths as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by earthquakes of 7.5 magnitude.
When the threat of a tsunami appeared yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately run away, leaving them as victims of it," said Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Major Accident Mitigation Agency BNPB in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but drew cars, tree trunks, houses and hit everywhere on the land," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km/h in the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the Disaster Agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks further shook the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area home to 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (PPPT) issued a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the terrain of a long and narrow city at the end of the bay could inflate the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that some of the victims' bodies were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the deaths and that the damage may be greater than Pilas 300 kilometers north on a continuous coast, in an area called Donggala, closer to the center of the quake.
Communications "are completely cut off and no information has been received about Donggala," Nugroho says.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, there are over 300,000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami struck Return, although authorities said the waves arrived during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of the building shouts fervently warnings of an impending tsunami for people on the street.
Just minutes later, a water wall strikes the beach, taking buildings and cars away.
Reuters was immediately unable to verify the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by transport aircraft, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief operations only, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit Palu's evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll exceeds 800.
It's a really bad situation.
World Vision's Donggala staff has been able to reach safety in the city of Palu, where they have been accommodated in tent fabric shelters in the office courtyard. On their way, they passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's a really bad situation.
As the aid groups began their uncomfortable mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were prevented from traveling to Return.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only start flowing once the affected area has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As long as the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can start receiving international aid, but no declaration has yet been made.
When the second night landed on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing entertained the hope that their loved ones would miraculously differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was lifted from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian suspension team, had coached two missing hang gliders for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month.
His students were also trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mandagi says.
"As a senior member of the addiction, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon says he desperately tried to reach Palu's competitors at the beach festival with WhatsApp messages after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel spread among the hang-in community.
However, only one gray sign appeared after the messages he sent instead of two blues.
"I understand that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 in connection with ATM supplementation in Newport on the Wide
The thieves took $26,750 from a Brink's security worker on Friday morning while he was completing an ATM in Newport on the Wide, as reported in a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car had been emptying and supplementing the ATM at the entertainment center," Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
When Brink's employee was elsewhere, "a man ran behind him" who stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses saw several people flee the scene, but police did not specify their number.
People with information about their identities are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "a character who used to be known as Kanye West."
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for some time and also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change precedes his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the show, cancelled her participation for "emotional reasons".
West has previously reported that the word also has religious significance for him, in addition to being an acronym for his professional name.
Speaking of the album's name earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "he believes that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it means "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and ended up in a shorter form Ye - which only embodies the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The album is mostly about who we are."
He is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known in varying degrees as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
West's previous partner JAY-Z has also sometimes removed and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use army against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement came as the country approached the 50th anniversary of reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador, who performed at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "never would use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
Armed forces fired on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student financial aid and opening more free public universities.
He said the lack of unemployment and educational opportunities would drive young people to criminal gangs.
Communities should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its funding for AI research as China streamlines its operations in the industry, as says Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and AI professional who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by communications on artificial intelligence in various parts of the US administration, although the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plans last year: it aims to become a leading developer of AI by 2030.
"Redouble the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," says Lee.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI achievement would be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book "The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. He works as CEO of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies called Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that outperformed the highest ranked Othello player in the United States. Later, he held leadership positions at Microsoft Research and was the director of Google's Chinese operations.
Lee recognized the US administration's previous technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be organized to identify future visionaries.
Lee says U.S. investigators worked hard to get public aid.
"Academic influencers are not taken by China, but by big corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited top universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States step up its AI efforts.
"I think those with a PhD in AI should automatically be awarded green cards," he said.
Chinese Government its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is designed to bring together partners in industry and the academic world. The White House has also announced the formation of a special AI committee.
DARPA also announced this month a $2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
NSF, in turn, invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the bill to set up the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not progressed for months.
Macedonians in referendum on changing country name
In a Sunday referendum, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "the Republic of North Macedonia". The name change would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that the North Neighbor's name is practically a territorial requirement for its belonging territory and has therefore opposed its access to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in a referendum, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the required 50% limit to make the result legal.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership, accepting the agreement with Greece".
Proponents like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the price is worth paying for Macedonia, which has risen since the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek membership of both the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they respect the outcome of the vote so that it has a decisive effect.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The Central Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34% in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections, when eventually 66% of those entitled to vote cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum on Macedonian name change in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The name change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and putting chairs in front of tents boycotting the referendum off the Skopje Parliament.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the kitchen door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn elsewhere, like to China and Russia as part of the euro area integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of over 20%.
"I believe the vast majority will vote for the name change because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" sound was our "shaping future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to 30-43% voter turnout in a referendum - that is, below the required activity.
In another survey commissioned by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
For a referendum to succeed, voter turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for a pro-Western government after it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat all Brighton's defense with his goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear trace of Brighton's defense at Manchester City's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the goal he scored at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the pattern, the Argentine top player received a pass from the midfield.
He found an empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender and then left behind several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first touch within the penalty area to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed Brighton watchman Mathew Ryan's goal with a shot in the right corner.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his feet."
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
It did.
Fortunately, he scored in that time."
Sterling had already given the sky blues an advantage in the Premier League campaign.
The goal came in 29 minutes of play.
Aguero was given the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass through to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane took a few touches before sending the ball to the back post towards Sterling.
The attacker of the sky blue poked the ball into the net just before the end limit.
City will face Hoffenheim in the league group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a spoilsport in a match against Rockies
The Nationals are out of the playoff battle, so why force the start lineup?
However, Scherzer, who is always as competitive, hopes to take over the pitch mound in a Sunday match against the Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a playoff seam. They have the difference of one win to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the western league.
Rockies grabbed at least a wild card with their 5-2 win from the Nationals on Friday night, but are still aiming for their first division win.
"Even though we don't have a bet, we can at least get on the pitch mound knowing that the mud atmosphere of the audience and another team here in Denver will create the most demanding competitive setting I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take on the challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet released their starters for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity in these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training period on Thursday, playing his 34 games at the start, and pitching on Sunday with his normal rest shift.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 win/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the batter into the nest 300 times, with a inning statistics of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who spoke at the same time about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
"All our achievements are at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important elections in our lifetime.
This is one of the really big ones -- not just campaigning, but campaigning to the fullest, and that's why I go everywhere to fight for the excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
They've decided to go back to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't choose who they harm or who they have to overwhelm to gain power, that's what they want, power and power, but we don't give it to them."
He said the Democrats took on the task of "opposing and preventing".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "hate and mean and malevolent and false."
As he referred to Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving Democrat in the Senate Legal Committee, the public responded with loud boos.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Eh, uh, what.
Well, uh no, I'm waiting a little bit - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a tolerant congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions
I was not really surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
After all, I'm just the latest Labour representative in the line, who is told I'm not welcome - just because we're saying our opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way just because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was a criticism of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Of the topics related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The Labour Conference in Nottingham East said Friday that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour representative, Friday-sized party councils have been just that.
Now not many meetings follow that tone of voice, and a more "friendly and gentle" policy has long since been forgotten if it even started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Labour no longer tolerates dissenting opinions, and that every opinion is judged on whether it is suitable for party leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom he thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me to have a turnaround and statements that I would otherwise never have agreed to, whether it be national security or the EU internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a roll of insults on social media calling for the cancellation of my choice, for the rejection of centrist politics, and for I to hear that I shouldn't be in Labour.
And it's not just my own experience.
I really know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because at least the comments that are directed at me are political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults every day and never waver.
Normalization of abuse is one of the most disturbing features of politics in this era.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn insisted that Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party accepting different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in the rules of choice, the party becomes only more limited.
For two years I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "everything would go well".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour as a student 32 years ago as a result of neglect of the Thatcher Government's Unified School, I have sought to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I have never covered up my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my perspectives or disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that as the state moves towards Brexit that hinders households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the Labour leadership.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr at the Block tip
Two last minute goals slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undeniably earned a win in the entertaining Tent's Premiership game of the day.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of ten who have not lost any games.
A great defense and more successful taking of risks was, after all, what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie may rightly be satisfied.
"We've been challenged in our games and we're still invincible, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrose Robyn Christie says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took over at 14 minutes with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of Scottish captain Roy Hughes, who was handed over to the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo increased Ayri's management with a penalty goal, and just before halftime he scored and managed to make a conversion kick, increasing Ayri's management to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, in whose conversion kick Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
There was a long delay in the match when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with Stafford McDowall's goal, whose conversion kick Climo succeeded.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrose's Bruce Colvine scored a goal that the conversion kick failed after intense pressure.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle the ballless Climo, and Macpherson scored at the back of Ayr's mule, who left the sideline throw.
Climo succeeded in the conversion kick in the same way as before, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and boosted Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the home team.
Still Game series star starts in restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named the head of a licensed restaurant company and will probably start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show he writes with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public register information, he is registered as the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.

The flag bars of public buildings fly the sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Titicaca to Amazon have been smeared with the slogan: "Really, the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource war remains strong — as is the longing to sail in the Pacific Ocean once more.
Hope is at its highest in decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of reflection.
"Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, team spirit and serenity, and of course a positive attitude in waiting for the final solution," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Several Bolivians across the country are hopefully following the International Court of Justice's decision on big screens, hoping that the Hague will advocate, at the end of decades of intermittent debate, Bolivia's position that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivian charismatic president Evo Morales, who will face a controversial battle for re-election next year, will have a lot at stake next Monday's policy.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in Bolivia's interest, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The UN institution of Dutch origin has no competence to extradite the Chilean administrative regions, and the ICJ has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ's decision is given just six months after the last statements were made suggests that the case "is not complicated," says Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have slowed down rather than promoted Bolivia's intentions.
"The current Bolivian regime has hijacked the issue of sea connection," said Zárate.
The rhetoric challenging Morales' quarrel has suppressed the rest of the Chilean benevolence, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to hold discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold negotiations after this.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
Former President and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to connect with the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announces that nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can trust the United States
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the United States to keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlock diplomacy with nuclear weapons, just three months after the United States met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "far away dream" to believe that continued sanctions and US opposition to the Korean War's end declaration would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pyongyang has first taken significant measures to promote disarmament, Washington is wary of adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to abandon the arsenal of weapons that the state is likely to see as the only real way to guarantee its own safety has received widespread doubt.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show the latest collection of large-sized headgear, which will soon be on your nearby street as well
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their SS19 collection show a selection of special oversized headgear that dazzled the style circles of Paris Fashion Weeks.
The highly impractical headgear took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feather lier, which covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other oversized accessories included a watermelon decorated with jewels, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple —but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks — just in time before Halloween.
Several colorful masks had sewn lips, and they resembled Hannibal Lecter more than top fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more similar to a diving device, and the other resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you want to take a stand for big fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion followers predict that huge scarves are emerging in the streetscape.
The hats of exaggerated size follow strictly "La Bomba", a straw hat with a half-meter cylinder seen in all Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult reputation of the widely seen impractical hat on social media also spurred another large creation into fashion shows — a beach bag made of straw that is almost as large as the model that carries it.
The burnt orange reed-decorated raffi bag with white leather hand straps was the most striking creation from Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I assume I'll see large-sized hats and beach bags in the streetscape next summer — designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are a key skill for global citizens
The learning outcomes of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of over 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council SCIS, aim to provide a high level of service to their students as well as to the parents of the students.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen career, postgraduate and higher education, and world citizenship.
As an educational operator who can design and implement customized study content, we have noticed the status of languages as a popular and desirable subject in continuing educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to establish relationships with people from other countries.
From this year's latest test results, we find that languages are at the top of the charts for the turnout rate among private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved the highest grade of A.
Based on the data, it was found that 72 per cent of students who received the best grade A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French, and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that Scottish private schools support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but are held in the same regard as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study program and elsewhere.
Based on a survey commissioned by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17% of situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for the promotion of the future career development of young people.
The more language skills that possible tasks require, the more relevant these skills become in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, they will have an advantage over this lifelong skill in the future, no matter what career they have chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey commissioned by YouGov, 75% of more than 4,000 British adults are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language they knew a two-digit number of 15%.
This is why investing in teaching languages is important for children today.
Knowledge of the languages of developing countries in particular gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach languages specifically that are supposedly important to the British in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese and Japanese.
Despite your child's interests, private schools always have several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
In this time frame, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment, languages will continue to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this freedom of choice, diversity and high-level Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the head of SCIS, the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron makes debut Sunday in San Diego
The expectations of supporters waiting for LeBron James' first appearance in the Los Angeles Lakers are almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday before the season begins.
But how many minutes he really plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton Lakers on the official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
James, who followed the exercises, was asked earlier this week about his plans for six games before the Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five election events scheduled for next week, including sympathetic targets such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits his election to fill the free seat of a Supreme Court judge, Trump is working to increase support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing a majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's West Virginia Wheeling event will begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as a live streaming via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will probably take a stand on this week's hearing with Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became ardent over sexual harassment charges that have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote as much as a week during the FBI's investigation.
But the primary goal for the series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in the tough November elections.
Thus, President Trump's campaign commented on the purpose of these five events next week to "awaken volunteers and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"Managing Congress is so essential to his purposes that the president is ready to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign said.
Today's venue is at Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and supporters can even arrive from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to West Virginia, a state where he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports Republican West Virginia senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has fallen behind in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is trying to increase his support in opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows fighting spirit to keep hope going before Sunday single-player games
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-player games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-affirming power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sports, players still believe it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where do they say this power of success is at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed to four, so we're taking this success power a little bit," said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, an advantage: four points ahead and 12 playable.
Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their sails and a lot to be encouraged by, such as the condition of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which allowed them to play together all day and score three out of four.
Spieth has been superior to brick on the green, and leads by example.
The hoarse throat sounds of the winning party intensified as his round progressed as he succeeded in a critical putt to smooth the match to exactly four when he and Thomas were two points behind after two holes.
The putt they won the 15th match was followed by a similar scream that gave the impression that he believes the US team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really well and only take care of your own match," Spieth said.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to impress.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The special but sweet two of Europe have won four out of four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only two that did not make any bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this boisterous audience, confirms that they are the favorites of Sunday. And when the sun goes down in Le Golf National, there could be no more popular player to ensure a possible win in Europe than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather both at the same time on different holes.
The talk of European success is premature, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, a four-player hero of the morning, who was paired with Alex Noren.
One bog and two double bogs on the first nine holes dug a Spaniard and a Swede so deep into the pit that they were nowhere near surviving it.
Although on Sunday, no one will come to help you out of the hole.
Four-ball and four-player are fascinating to follow from a close-up partner's point of view: What advice they give or fail to give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-player showed that the US team has a will to fight, although it has been suspected, especially in the United States.
Europe takes 10-6 lead before last day of Ryder Cup
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of the Ryder Cup after they took 10-6 lead in Saturday's four-balls and four-player games from the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the triumph with two wins over the rapping Tiger Woods, and got the score high to four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, which made a great effort to keep two years ago in Hazeltine losing the win, dominated the poorly played US team in the morning four-ball, taking the match to 3-1.
The United States was a tougher opponent in four games, winning two games, but they were unable to narrow the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points for Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called "Molliwood", were the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend, having won four points in the first four games.
After first crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they then finished the superiorly discouraged Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau even more vigorously 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through the two games on Saturday, was very brilliant at times, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and fours, and up to seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested on the four-balls this morning, but returned with Henrik Stenson to doubles, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the rankings.
Europe did not get everything as it wished on this fresh and pleasant day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a tough 2-1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four balls in Spain, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in four games after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team risen from a four-point chase position to levels when doubles begin, although on the Furyk side, the draw is also enough to keep the win.
However, after two days, the second best may be that Sunday's counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea 'nothing' to disarm itself without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased distrust of the United States, and under these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant benevolent measures" in the past year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so in such circumstances, it is not possible to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
Although Ri reiterated the familiar lamentation that Washington does not accept a step-by-step phase-out of nuclear weapons, which would reward North Korea for every intermediate issue, his statement must nevertheless be significant in the sense that unilateral disarmament was not completely excluded, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US sitting president and North Korean leader summit in Singapore on June 12, in a statement that Kim assured of "the disarmament of the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has made efforts to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States is calling for 'removal of nuclear weapons first', and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals by force — even resisting a 'proclamation of peace'," Ri said.
"The notion that sanctions would bring us to our knees is a wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself stressed to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party requiring disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have reached such a dead end."
Yet Rin's tone was significantly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that heading missiles towards the United States in continental areas was inevitable after "bad president" Trump called Kim a "missile man" with suicidal intentions.
Last year, Trump threatened to " completely destroy" North Korea. However, this year Trump praised Kim profusely for his courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but stressed that there is still much work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea renounces nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he does not have a time deadline: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the advances already made.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the strengthening of the Security Council's sanctions must continue to be strong and unsuccessful until we prove a full, final and confirmed abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with the aim of halting Pyongyang's funding channels for ballistic and nuclear missile production.
Pompeo met with North Korea's Rin in connection with the UN General Assembly, and announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go smoothly.
When he left Pyongyang, he described the progress made, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like demands" just a few hours later.
North Korea committed to closing the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes "equivalent measures".
Pompeo said Kim means "equivalent measures" to secure the security guarantees Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course of adequate rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University will attend a course this year to increase student rest. The course is a counterattack to the university's thriving macho culture, where students weigh long nights with the power of caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite unaware of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler had an idea for the course after lecturing on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the lecture, a young woman came to me and said, 'Why do I only hear about it now, in my last year of study?'
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I found surprising," he told the Telegraph in an interview.
For the first time this year, the course will guide students on how to support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard University School of Medicine and deputy director of health services at the university, says the university ended up organizing the course after hearing how students suffered severe sleep deprivation during the week of study.
The hour-long course includes a set of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of a dormitory room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thus gaining information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section will tell participants how long-term sleep deprivation can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
"We know this has no immediate impact on students' behavior.
However, we believe they have a right to know about these issues in exactly the same way they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking," Professor Czeisler adds.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study marathons are still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
"Getting enough and high-quality sleep should be a 'secret weapon' for students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state similar to starvation in the brain, which is why a person is constantly hungry," the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course after attending one of the courses he taught in his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave impetus to organizing a course covering all campus students.
He hopes that all graduate students can complete a similar study module before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm clock to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking up in the morning and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the circadian rhythm, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga shot won by Gerrard players
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers experienced yet another day of defeat when Dolly Menga's shot through a broken defense brought Livingston a 1-0 win.
Ibrox players were applying for their first win since the February 4-1 game, which was against St. Johnstone. However, Gary Holt's team won this time, and Gerrard was now only experiencing his second loss during his 18-game manager career. The Rangers were eight points away from the current leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga scored the ball seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' falling fighting will then no longer leveled the situation.
The Rangers fell to sixth place as a result of the game, while Livingston has climbed to third place, and only Hibernia is above the goal difference.
Rangers may have other problems ahead of them, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object thrown out of a gueststand hit the head, and the wound has had to be treated.
Gerrard made eight exchanges for the lineup with which the team had beaten Ayr and advanced to the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued with the same Livi 11 lineup that the team took the point from Hearts last week. The same strategy again paid off when a well-built lineup managed to discipline the opponent at almost every turn.
Although the Rangers managed to dominate the possession of the ball, Livingston was better off using the situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to score already at two minutes when Menga's first pass gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor's goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but another defender, Alan Lithgow, only managed to shoot wide in the back post.
Rangers, on the other hand, took control of the game, but the last third of the game had no confidence in the air anymore.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment after at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had run into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly effortlessly turned down Lassana Coulibaly's bush and Ovie Ejaria's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers could still do nothing about Jacobs' long pitch tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly escorted the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
During the exchange period, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The exchange affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable gap for Morelos. However, the attack broke Kelly's influence on quick defense.
Livingston made visitors play their own game again as Lithgow and Halkett continued long assists one after another.
Holt's team had the opportunity to raise their lead at the last moments of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs' intentions before Lithgow could reach his positions at an angle.
Glenn Middleton, who came in from the Rangers exchange, also demanded a penalty kick after clashing with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter inventor
Next, page "Sunday Morning" from our almanac: September 30, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a device known as a geiger meter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and also a central concept of pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "Coronado Watches", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists who seem quite cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geigermeter, used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really a ride!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New cancer vaccine capable of teaching immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells and destroy them
Vaccine teaches immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory
After treatment, cells injected back into the body are able to ‘see’ proteins typical of multiple cancers
Koerokote has given promising results in different patients with cancer.
For example, cancer cells in a patient with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
The method isolates resistant cells from the patient and changes them in the laboratory so that they are able to ‘see' the HER2 proteins typical of several cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, USA, describes the method: "Based on our results, it's a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "directs the growth of several types of cancer," Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and ovarian, lung and colon cancers."
A similar approach — taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells — has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West was toothed by critics after praising Trump on Saturday Night Live with a campaign hat on his head.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West was hit by boos on Saturday Night Live after praising President Donald Trump in a snotty style and announcing his running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the evening, "Ghost Town" in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white person, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he says.
The evening's broadcast began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which relates to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's rant was not shown live, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a fragment of it to social media.
It is unclear if Rock is going to mock West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been mistreated behind the scenes for a hat he held on his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go on stage with this hat on my head.
I've been bullied!
Then they say I'm marginalized," West says in an interview with Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what it means to be marginal?" and says he wears Superman because "then you can't tell me what I'm doing.
Try with love."
According to Variety, West's comments sparked boos from the audience at least twice, and the show's performers looked embarrassed. One of those present described the situation to the paper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was selected for the program on short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by performing the song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, who praised his courage on Twitter: "Thank you for the old days".
Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West "is just herself, which is absolutely wonderful."
"However, I can decide not to know a person (by buying his music or clothing brand or by supporting his "art"), which I consider to support and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free person.
The same goes for us," he added.
Before his show tonight, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "a person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. The musician here follows Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course we also remember the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then an artist known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabbing charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in the Ballyhackamore area, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear before a Belfast court on Monday.
The charge is reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The cast star of the throne game Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-waving hero role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series Throne Game.
However, Harrington has attacked the macho hero's stereotype: according to a 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with hardness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural appendix, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong," and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity in the era of the #MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who recently married Rose Leslie, a member of the Star Guard of the Throne Game, also admits that she has a strong desire to intervene.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity evokes strong feelings in me at the moment," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that has led to problems that are now noticeable?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters that appear in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues, "What is innate and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel they have to be certain kinds of people to be men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how can we change this?
Young men have something really wrong."
In an interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of the pre- or sequels to the Throne Game after the series ends next summer because he has, in his own words, "get enough of the battlefields and horses."
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which is about the film producer and his robbing brother.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife Rose was the best that the Throne Game has offered her.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on," she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of Harrington's Jon Snow's love in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections in China have increased by 14%
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-affected citizens.
Health officials say the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, HIV infections in this way have been reduced to almost zero.
However, a year later, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infections through sex are an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that due to the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many disease infections are caused by insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to guarantee universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employee leaked Republican senator information and accuses of spreading "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied allegations that her employees had published personal information about three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages that apply to them.
A Democratic representative from Los Angeles assured that the claims were spread by "extreme right-wing" commentators and websites.
"Wies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the published data were home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah State Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown person published the information Thursday from the United States Congress during a hearing of the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that, according to the Hill newspaper, the messages were published from an IP address connected to Waters' office and by a person on Waters' staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and critics were also accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he denies this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not appropriate for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There is no reason for defiance.
There is no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to behave in moderation and calmness."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters' place in the Congressional midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true," he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that he had contacted "appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies for these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he continued, "and that they are brought to legal responsibility for any destructive and dangerous action against some or all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Underpowered Rowan Atkinson Agent Parody
It is already an established tradition to look for Brexit references in any film that is tilted to Britain. However, this does not seem to fit the Johnny English agent parody and action comedy series that originated in 2003 on the Johnny English web and resurrected with the 2011 sequel "Johnny English - Reborn".
Can a nation's satire made with a tongue on the cheek become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the glaring-eyed, cumin-faced and incompetent Johnny English has earned his permission to screw up for the second time. Even his name tells us above all that it is a comic creation aimed at the film market outside the English-speaking world.
It is, of course, the tolvana secret agent who desperately seeks to breathe the glamour that melts around him, but appears as a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that unfortunate single note musician at the 2012 opening concert in London.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical world man who left sheer chaos, who was originally portrayed by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The latest show has its moments.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor's blades knock on his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts come out, but the humor itself seems underpowered and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands such as 007 and Dangerous Mission now offer humor as part of the film's central content.
Humor seems to be directed at children, and it doesn't seem as inventive and sharp-looking to me as the comedy of Atkinson's Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The recurring starting point each year is that Great Britain is in trouble for the worse.
The cyberhacker has infiltrated Britain's top secret spy network and reveals the identities of all British agents operating on the field to the dismay of the agent in service — which is presented as Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little performance.
This is the last drop for a pompous and pinned prime minister who is already up to his ears in the swamp of political disfavor: Emma Thompson does everything she can in the skins of the Teresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't provide him with enough space.
When intelligence advisors inform him that all spies on the field have been exposed, someone who has already moved aside from active service must be called to the rescue.
Of course, it is a screw-up Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time gives informal lessons in the noble art of espionage. The subject sparks some clever jokes; English keeps School of Rock-type lessons in the secrets of intelligence activities.
English is rushed to an emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he meets again his endlessly patient fighting partner Bough, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine does not seem to be able to get her rights.
Thus, catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to His Majesty's secret service to face the fatal supercriminal Ophelia Bhutan, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, and Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey immediately turns into a farce: a duo disguised as waiters sets a fine French restaurant on fire and causes chaos in secretly striving for Volta's luxury yacht. The attempt to get to know Volta's house with virtual glasses ends up in pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last inhibitions of the authors fade when they come to the final scene, but despite all the powerlessness and charm, the film still feels a little bit like being made for the child audience.
The film can be considered moderate.
While watching Johnny English movies, I have ended up in the same reflection before: why is the British film industry unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
British Labour Party denies plans for four-day work week with five-day pay
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the pay would be paid for five days.
The party reportedly calls on business leaders to transfer the savings of the AI revolution to the workers in the form of an extra holiday.
The plan would allow employees to enjoy three-day weekends on the same salary.
Sources say the idea of ‘suitable’ to the party's economic program and its plans to tilt politics for the benefit of the workers.
The Confederation of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A high-level Labour source tells the Sunday Times: "The review of the bill should be announced before the turn of the year.
Change does not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea: the British Green Party committed to supporting the transition to a four-day work week in the context of its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive undivided support in the Labour ranks.
A Labour spokesman states, "The four-day work week is not a party policy, and the party is not considering moving to one."
Shadow Government Finance Minister John McDonnell used the work conference last week to present his vision for the economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover power from "faceless dictators" and "artificialists" of public utility companies.
According to the plans of the Minister of Finance of the Shadow Board, the current shareholders of water companies would not regain their share in its entirety, because the Labour-led government could implement "reductions" based on the abuses found.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds that would transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee management, and that an individual employee would be paid up to £500 in dividends each year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss on 60 Minutes whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
An investigation into allegations against FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least a week's final vote to appoint Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge. The delay also raises the question of whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican senators for Kavanaugh's appointment.
In a 60-minute episode on Sunday, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Party senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it could be possible for the FBI to find out things that would allow them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing... I said I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened when the accusations came out, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone-cut one.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied it sharply," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the people he named were able to confirm the matter.
This is a 36-year-old issue.
I don't see what could change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, held Saturday in New York City, is a music event with a performance guard as impressive as its mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now being held for the seventh time, attracts tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are active in eradicating poverty.
To get a free ticket to an event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public must perform various tasks or "acts", such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision maker, or making a call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen been successful now that there are only 12 years left to achieve this goal?
Does the idea of rewarding with a free concert ticket have a real way of persuading people to take action, or is it just one ‘clitivism’ among others — the notion that you can change the world by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announces that it has recorded more than 19 million "works" for different goals since 2011.
It says that these actions have encouraged policymakers to announce commitments and principles equivalent to more than $37 billion, and have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and statements based on which more than $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds made have already affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and executives committed to "helping children develop to their full potential". The group committed to delivering $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country. This happened after activists sent them 4,700 tweets as a result of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments in different countries and world citizens like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history magazines," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the public at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also said the British government was urged to take steps to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions, and the government has announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions column on the store's website is, "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global citizen's response: "The road will be long and difficult and many stumbling blocks ahead of us.
But we will succeed, like the great civil rights struggles and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman host the New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
US Home Office says the country could make energy exports more difficult by using the Navy as an "barrier"
According to Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Home Secretary quoted by the Washington Examiner, Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet's aid to prevent the spread of Russian energy on the world market, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia's actions in Syria — at the invitation of the legitimate government — are an excuse for sounding new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that [Russia]'s reason for its presence in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern half of Europe," Zinken said.
According to the official, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep ship routes open through its fleet and, if necessary, by surrounding to ensure that the energy they provide does not end up in the world market," he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about an event organized by the Association of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that profiles itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less speculation, and replacing fuel with another," he says, and describes Russia as "the circus number of one trick" whose economy is based on fossil fuels.
The statements take place in a situation where the Trump administration has sought to step up the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace much cheaper Russian liquefied natural gas with it.
To make this more effective, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says will tie Berlin to the Moscow leash.
Moscow has repeatedly focused on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which aims to double the 110 billion cubic metres transmission capacity of the pipeline in use, to be a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and considers it an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella organisation, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that the third state becomes involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry, said recently after a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, plans to think carefully" about running for presidential election in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she would "be careful" to run for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a nomination at an open poll in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our faulty regime, and this also means a woman at the headship of the kingdom," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to think carefully about running for president."
Warren judged President Donald Trump during the event by saying that "he is taking the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has appeared outspoken in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, according to a poll published Thursday, the majority of Warren's constituents are not in favour of this being nominated in 2020.
According to a study by the Department of Policy Studies at Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" voters in Massachusetts are not in favor of the senator running.
32% supported the nomination.
More of the respondents supported former governor Deval Patrick's running for 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates who emerged in the talks for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press news agency, Biden has said he will officially decide on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war traumas at Donald Trump election ceremony
Sarah Palin's son Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the armed forces in September.
Track Palin arrested on Monday night and was charged with domestic violence
"What my own son has to go through when he returns home, I can well identify with other families who are facing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries our returning soldiers carry," he told an audience gathered at Donald Trump's election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a ‘powerhorse in the living room’ and said his son, like other war veterans,' would return home a little changed, they would return hardened, they would return wondering if what he and his comrades in the army and air force have done for this country."
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Wasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as domestic violence and handling a gun intoxicated.
18 states and Columbia Federal District support action against new asylum practice
Eighteen states and the Columbia Federal District are seeking an amendment to the new policy that came into force in the United States that asylum will not be granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and federal districts have filed a court friends letter on Friday in Washington, D.C. The letter supports policy-breaking asylum seekers reported by NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been announced in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit brought against the federal policy by the American Civil Liberties Union in August.
He says he was abused by his partner "and his sons in a violent gang." U.S. officials denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, of which much of the asylum seekers in the United States come, as states where gang and domestic violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned the 2014 Board of Appeal for Asylum Applications, which allowed undocumented migrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
Columbia Federal District Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring states, federal and international law for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be settled on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle" says the Friends of the Right.
Prosecutors also claim in the letter that asylum seekers' access prevents practice from damaging the US economy, as the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "bring the additional labour needed."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges on entry to suspend the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is intended for persons fleeing their homeland due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems —even serious problems — that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts of survivors continue in Palu - the number of deaths found has already doubled
For survivors, the situation becomes more serious.
"The situation is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Ambulances bring new bodies minute by minute.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered things, and try to save what is still to be saved.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffers from spine and shoulder fractures, rest outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated for constant, intense aftershocks.
His eyes are filled with tears as he recounted how a furious earthquake shook the fifth floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the ruins of the wall, I think." Harris says, according to the Associated Press, and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "provocating" with "propaganda announcements"
The U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after the Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual interests of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid annex to the China Daily newspaper Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa in circulation, after accusing China of interfering in the Congressional elections on November 6, China has denied the allegations.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US election marks a new phase in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread declarations to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-escalating trade war, where both parties in turn impose customs duties on the counterparty's export products.
Chinese and American experts said China's revenge tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and longtime Governor of Iowa State, says Beijing has done damage to the U.S. working population, farmers and businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now accelerating its provocations further by publishing propaganda announcements in our own free press," wrote Branstad in his opinion paper published on Sunday's Des Moines Register.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government benefits from the prestigious free word and press traditions of the United States by placing a paid announcement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In Beijing street newsstands, on the other hand, differing opinions are only limited, and the real, divergent opinions that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy are not seen at all. This is because the media is firmly on the leash of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad goes on to say that "one of China's greatest newspapers dodged the offer to publish" an article he wrote, but does not specify which magazine it is about.
Kavanaugh fiasco expels female voters from Republicans, analysts warn
The fact that many of the top names of Republicans stand behind Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh and defend him can cause a counter-reaction, according to analysts, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been going on big rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be canceled," says Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell Institute in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher does not believe Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesperson for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang that "November is coming" when they demonstrated in the Senate corridors as the ruling Republicans in the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment, which occurred despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be evaluable," says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in an interview with the news site.
"People say the enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the insecure female voters and younger voters in the suburbs, aged 18-29, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Analysts anticipate a possible response if Republicans progressed with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he made his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess with the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Speaker of the Republican National Committee on NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is being questioned, it's about how Republicans have acted on the matter and how they've treated Ford," Guy Cecil, the leader of the Democratic Priorities USA group, pointed out to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided as to whether they should believe Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony as a narrow majority bend to the latter.
According to a new poll by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or likely, while 35% say they absolutely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake pushes the matter forward, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified in front of the Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh was harassing him when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate revealed to him his genitals at a student party while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch new Internet in return for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to which data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is to "rule the world".
"It has to be done now," he said, referring to his startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse", or POD.
It may include lists of contacts, memory lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about a personal repository is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through information".
According to John Bruce, the company's CEO, Inrupt's idea is to give resources, processes and the skills required to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently comprises a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some hired developers working with the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Technology developers around the world can create their own distributed applications with the tools available on Inrupt's website. All of this will be available from this week onwards.
Berners-Lee says he and his team will not discuss "with Facebook and Google whether people should be offered a complete change in which all their business models are turned on their heads overnight."
"We are not asking for their consent to the matter."
In an article published at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "the mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute even after Inrupt was launched.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: City remembers the hero priest of World War I
The city celebrates the Church of England's only priest awarded the Victoria Cross Medal, who has been a soldier, after 100 years of events.
The Medal of Courage was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellengline and Lehaucourt.
Vann died, however, a sniper was created four days later without ever learning of the highest British military honor he received.
Two of his grandchildren were revealing a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "influenced symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his award-winning grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns."
Later he plunged into the front line and, showing the "greatest bravery," led the troops to advance before their assaults on the field gun alone. In the ensuing battle, Vann poured three gun battery soldiers with his own hands.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann died from a German sniper created on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something I could never achieve, something that inspires respect."
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr James Vann counted a wreath after a parade paced by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is "a great honor to be able to participate in the parade" and added, "a great multitude of people are remembering the glory of a true hero."
Free-to-play friends waited awake all night for Bellator 206 tournament - TV channel showed Pipsa Pig
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event is not presented.
The programme of the event in San Jose had 13 matches, six of which were main series matches, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program was turned into a great dismay for the viewers of Pipsa Possu.
Some viewers were not really happy to stay up all night for the match.
One of the free-to-play friends opened up on Twitter describing replacing the match with a children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke".
"The law said that the content in question was not appropriate to be presented at 6 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children's program," explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior assistant marketing and communications director for changing the program.
"Pipsa Pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that schedules will be worked on so that UK viewers can follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a retransmission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"It's six in the morning, however, and we can't get the show presented until Sunday in our time, which in turn is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to go one way and the other and they were not all friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, it was a legislative matter.
I can promise you that next time this will not happen.
We're limiting the number of matches to five instead of six, as usual, trying to offer our fans more and trying too hard.
This is a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Swimming jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete says he only noticed when he came to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Daley, who spoke on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, says she spoke about gay rights to give others ‘hope.'
She also explains how it was no longer so important to win at the Olympics after having a child.
Kristy Young, the regular host of a long-term radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
While performing as a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt ‘less’ when she was young than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and jobs."
He relates, "To this day, these feelings, to feel less and different have been a reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wants to show that he is ‘something’ so that he doesn't disappoint everyone when his sexuality is finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and he appears at this year's Commonwealth Games appealing to criminalize homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he feels lucky to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give ‘hope’ to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of his falling in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — as "a surprise to come."
Daley married this 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age" — he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — "it's hard to find another person of the same age who would have experienced similar sympathy and adversity," Daley says.
The couple had a son in June — Robert Ray Black-Daley — as a result of which Daley's "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have revolved around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than the Golden Olympic Medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of only 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father never accepted that he would die, and one of the latest things he asked Daley was about the 2012 Olympic tickets, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he was not going to be there anymore to be in the front row," Daley says.
"I held his hand when his breath stopped. It wasn't until his breathing had really stopped and he was dead that I finally realized that he wasn't invulnerable," he says.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I've been dreaming about my whole life — jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics.
This was also an inspiration for his first song choice on the broadcast — Heather Small's song "Proud" — which evoked feelings as he prepared for the Olympics, and which still gets his skin on chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Half-fit Mickelson bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson, an American, breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he must pet substantially to avoid a record round falling into history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who plays at a two-yearly event for the record 12th time, moved to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the duration of the fourball and foursome to be played on Saturday.
Usually, the center of attention American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half a day as a cheerleader and the other half on the field trying to get control of his beat.
48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course where a long-grown rough punishes inaccurate punches.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson himself in the field, the ninth game on Sunday will be met by British Open winner Francesco Molinari, known for his accuracy, who will play together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to set the streak of all four wins this week.
If Americans who are four points behind 12 doubles get a flying start, Michelson's game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could you say in the situation.
"He perfectly understands the role he played today, he patted me on the back, squeezed me, and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He is undoubtedly one of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I imagined something else, but this is how it went and this is the solution we came to.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for more Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It can also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, clever, likes to joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy that everyone likes to follow," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week too, and it's amusing to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just his stake in the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows how long the lead can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the Ryder Cup's vast leadership position before the last day's doubles games can become a bumpy journey.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but which became the winner with lime lines just about the length of its nose and won with the narrowest margin possible141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"It reminds us of how we led briskly in Valderrama, we led briskly in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit sparsely," said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 5-3 wins both Friday and yesterday, moving to 10-8 in the Le Golf National course.
History will show both me and all the other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We go out on the field and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we try to win that prize, and we aim only for that.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who play on our side. However, we are aware of what is on the other side: the best players in the world."
delighted with how his team's players have performed in a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I never lick until I fall into such things.
Tomorrow is a completely different matter.
Tomorrow, individual performances will be a priority, and that's when we talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when you are alone on the field, then the player's capacity is tested to the bottom.
This is a message that must be passed on to players - tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go [to the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opposing captain Jim Furyk will require better performance from his players as individuals than they could as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the turnarounds of the last day in both directions. He was on the team that won Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won with the "Medinah Miracle".
"I remember every damn word," he answered the question of how the 1999 team captain Ben Crenshaw handed his team the lines to the last day's trials.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like it did in Brookline, or like it happened in Medinah.
When you get it moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have adjusted our lineup accordingly and put the boys on the field as we wish, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense battle and faces Rory McIlroy in the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order next to face their European opponents.
"I put the group guys in this order because I think it carries the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his doubles choices.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014. The ship is intended to replace the ageing Cold War equipment, but it will not be introduced until next year, due to faulty systems and explosively increasing costs, local media reports say.
According to a military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit, the commissioning of ‘Rheinland-Palatinate', the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have haunted an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to available data, they are equipped with powerful cannons, missile systems for aircraft and surface vessel control, and stealth technology such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic signal detection technology.
Important features of the ship also include its longer service interval - new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the home port at times.
However, continued delays mean that warships representing the cutting edge of technology — which are said to be intended to improve Germany's influence in overseas territories — are already obsolete by the time they enter service, Die Zeit points out.
The unlucky F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to introduce the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet has returned the ship since it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but there has been talk in German media of essential "software and device failures" that make the warship unfit for combat missions.
Software deficiencies are particularly central because the crew of Baden-Württemberg-class ships is about 120, which is only half the crew of senior Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship is significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the fleet's chances of subsequent upgrades.
Rhineland-Palatinate, with a capacity of 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the corresponding class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the price tag for the whole project is also becoming a problem.
The price is reported to have risen to a stunning amount of €3.1 billion, compared to an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of making new frigates available have emerged as the German maritime power has recently been warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable ships "are running low".
According to the authority, the problem has increased over time because old ships have been decommissioned, but no new ones have been delivered to replace them.
He complained that no Fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been commissioned by the fleet.
Environmental organization eavesdrops on hidden life of bats
A new study in the area of the Scottish Highlands aims to find out how bats use the terrain to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new study will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide you in future conservation measures.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland observes measly and dwarf bats, as well as earrings and water wings in the Inverewe Garden area of the Botanical Garden in Wester Ross.
In the study, special storage devices are placed at important points in the area to monitor the bats' operation during the season.
The organization's employees and volunteers also perform mobile measurements using portable observation devices.
The frequencies of the sounds and what species are involved at any given time are ensured by the analysis of the experts.
Based on the results, a habitat map and report are created, where the behaviour of the bats can be represented in an image that follows the scale of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats, and how different species utilize them.
The information helps with the planning of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking bats and related species into account.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined considerably over the past 100 years.
Construction and construction work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful in catching prey than in eyes.
Bats use advanced echo positioning technology to detect insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organization focusing on the protection of the rural environment, maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens, and 76,000 hectares across the country — and they take bats seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, rest site inspections and, in some cases, animal rescue operations.
The organization has even established Scotland's first and only protected area for the protection of bats on the land of the Thrave Manor in the Dumfries and Galloway area, with eight of Scotland's ten bat species found in the area.
According to Farm Manager David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and overall a good living environment.
Not everything is known about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us better understand what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of checking buildings for bats before taking up renovation work, as the destruction of one bat resting place can inadvertently cause the death of up to 400 female bats and chicks and eradicate an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and killing, disturbing or destroying their resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Protection Organization, encourages the public to participate in the conservation work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't yet know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo denies rape allegations while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says people want to "advertise themselves" using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the alleged German magazine Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Lasvegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for the silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared on Instagram for 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old footballer strongly rejected the allegations and described them as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What have they said today, fake news," a five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel to sue for allegations they have called "unprofitable reporting of privacy suspicions" according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player demands compensation for "spiritual suffering in accordance with the seriousness of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met at a nightclub and moved into a player's room where he allegedly raped her anally, according to papers submitted to the Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo landed on his knees after the alleged event and said he was "9% good guy", but whose "one percent" disappointed him.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was a matter of mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have visited the police station and taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later came to a compromise because she was "horrible about the possibility of revenge" and worried "to be subjected to public humiliation."
The 34-year-old now says he is seeking the annulment of the settlement procedure because he is still traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to an agreement to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged assault, and moved to the Italian power team Juventus with a $100 million contract.
Brexit: UK "should regret forever" end of car manufacturing
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit," Minister of Economic Affairs Greg Clark said.
He added that he found it "careful" Toyota's UK unit's announcement to temporarily suspend production in Burnaston at its factory near Derby if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
A Japanese car manufacturer says the impact of border delays will be visible as job losses if Brexit is reached without a contract.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain suddenly exits the EU at the end of March, there will be interruptions in our factory production," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota's Burnaston unit.
Other UK-based car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about exiting the European Union in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Mini manufacturing plant for a month when Brexit is completed.
The main concern concerns the risks associated with the supply chain when a no-deal Brexit occurs, according to car manufacturers.
Toyota's production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars are manufactured on request.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Keeping a warehouse lasting more than 24 hours at the Derbyshire plant is impossible, according to Toyota, and production would be suspended.
Clark says Theresa May's plan for EU relations is "exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal; we want the best possible deal, which not only means success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only the statements from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, show that we absolutely must be able to continue the supply chain series that have worked very well so far."
Toyota cannot tell you how long production would be stopped, but warns that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union's trustee at the factory, says the concern is growing among the members: "In my experience, lost jobs will never return.
A government spokesman says, "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can "must have to be postponed for another week" due to the controversy around Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference in the elections, Trump's assistants' contacts with Russia, and any action the president may have taken to prevent justice.
There have been rumors in Washington for months that Trump is going to fire the Deputy Attorney General, which would jeopardize Mueller's investigation's neutrality.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of firing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is reported to have been Rosenstein's resignation.
However, President Trump was visiting the United Nations in New York at the time, so Thursday was announced as the day of the meeting.
Trump said he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because its date coincided with a hearing from the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI week-long investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further postponed the Senate plenary vote.
Trump press chief Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said, "No date has been set for this. It could be next week, this week, it can be postponed for another week due to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court at this time.
It remains to be seen, but I always want to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, a news anchor, asked why.
Sanders says the reason for the lack of press conferences is for reasons other than disgust with the "attention" of TV journalists, but stated, "I do not deny the fact that they are attention-seeking."
Sanders, however, suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more survey hours than any president before him," he says, and adds more evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"Press events will still be held," Sanders said, "it's infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to talk to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this many times in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Performing alone at a press conference is rare.
This week in New York City, the president may have shown the reason for this when he appeared uninhibitedly and from time to time strangely to journalists gathered.
Health Minister wrote a letter to employees of the Scottish Public Health System (NHS Scotland) from EU countries regarding fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees of the Scottish health system from EU countries to express their gratitude and hopes for them to stay in the country after Brexit.
Scottish Member of Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months left until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already prepared to cover the costs of applications for "established status" for EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter, Freeman writes the following: During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
The United Kingdom government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie for emergency surgery due to head injury
Tennessee State Tigers supporter Christion Abercrombie has been under emergency surgery since the team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessea journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and simply collapsed into it," Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him aside for more accurate evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has been discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/wideness of the injury at this point," and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays for his first season on the team since his move from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless as planned by the Conservative Party.
The purpose of the change is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today the higher stamp tax rate for foreign buyers when they buy real estate in the UK.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters, who have made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to the taxation of the well-off.
The raising of the stamp tax is targeted at people and companies that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money from this is directed to the government's efforts to ease the distress of the homeless.
The additional fee — added to the current stamp tax two years ago in addition to the second home and investment housing increases — can be up to 3%.
The Finance Minister expects the increase to generate up to £120 million annually.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-UK permanent residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to have opportunities in the owner-occupied housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK — especially in its capital — have become ‘ghost cities’ because several foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering the stamp tax as a way to facilitate the purchase of first homes for young people.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building it, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon quotas for affordable housing to remedy Britain's "shameful situation of housing".
Corbyn has published a striking series of proposals to reform the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of "confidential evictions".
He would also like to give councils more power over matters related to the construction of new housing.
Prime Minister May says, "Last year I said I was going to dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream — that every generation's life should be better than its predecessor.
This means repairing our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies abroad, to be able to buy housing as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become far too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "original goal" is to become the Scottish team manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is excited about his challenge of lifting the team that is home to the northeastern corner of the country back on their feet, currently in third place in the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "Light Stadium" this summer after directing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got on team two and that was it," Ross said on BBC: Scotland's Sportsound.
"As a child, I often watched Scottish games with my father at Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
This kind of opportunity will only come if I succeed as the club's manager."
Ross' predecessors Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic director says he was not concerned about stepping into the shoes of his renowned predecessors in famous company, who has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At the moment, I'm going to have my own success with whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Based on the structure and ability of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I probably would only consider myself successful if I can pilot the team back into the Premier League."
Ross has only been a manager for three years: first as an assistant director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months in the Heats Coach Group.
He then helped Alloa rise from the fall games of the third series and raised St Mirren from falling condition to champions over the next season.
Ross says he feels better now than ever during his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was probably at a real crossroads with my career," he recalls the time he took over Alloa.
"I really thought I was better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, made a moderate amount of money and enjoyed some relatively big successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I still go through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running a team feels just the right task.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I do it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life."
The entire interview is available for listening on Sportsound on Sunday 30.9, Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST
The perfect time to enjoy a pint is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., the study shows
The summer heat wave has fired on pubs struggling with British difficulties, but at the same time put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales of pub and bar chains increased by 2.7% during July, but restaurant returns fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consulting firm that compiled the figures from CGA, says: "Continuous sunny weather and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July became like June with pub sales 2.8% higher, while for restaurants the month was even worse.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the drinking side were the most successful. Their like-for-like sales grew more than the decline in restaurant sales.
The pubs focused on the food side also suffer from heat, but less dramatically than the operators of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink out in their minds.
Sales of business-run pubs and bar drinks increased by 6.6% over the month, with a 3% drop in food sales."
Paul Newman of RSM, a company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: "The results continue to trend, which has been going on since late April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sales of the out-of-home meal market.
It is no surprise that the struggle between restaurant chains continues, although the 4.8% annual sales decline is sparking, especially now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to a worse seam for operators focused on food, and only time will tell if the temperate temperatures in August will bring the breath break that the industry sorely needs.
The combined sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer following sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which compiles and analyzes performance data from 47 industry-based groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, which is considered a reliable measure of the industry.
One fifth of children encrypt social media accounts from their parents
One fifth of children — some up to 11 years old — encrypt social media accounts from their parents and teachers, the study says
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon of ‘Instagram fake accounts’
News raised concerns that sexual-toned content can be shared in accounts
20% of students said they hold a ‘main account’ that is shown to parents
One fifth of children —some of whom are up to 11 years old — create social media accounts that they encrypt from adults.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram fake accounts’, which refers to an Instagram site for sharing images.
The news has raised fears that sexual-toned content can be published on accounts.
20% of students said they would keep a cleaned ‘main account’ for parents to show while using other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager hoping to be raped after colliding with her 13-year-old daughter's secret site.
A study commissioned by the Digital Awareness UK and the Principal Advisory Board (HMC) found that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 kept two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan says, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle to "The Voice of Athletes" to Scottish Athletes Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletes' Board of Directors, taking part in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete. Chairman of the Board Ian Beattie describes the appointment as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the wide-ranging, international experience the athlete has accumulated over the past decade.
"Eilidhi is highly respected among athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally. I am sure Scottish athletes would benefit enormously from his appointment to the government," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as the mouthpiece of athletes and hope I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
An American athlete who won four Olympic gold medals and won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now serves as a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his walking ability as a result of a transient brain circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
Doctors say only time will tell if I will recover and in what condition.
This has been a exhausting job, but I have fully recovered, learned to walk again and now I am already training agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An ad that equates mothers with cows shares opinions online
The advertising, which equates the nursing mothers of a breast pump company with dairy cows, has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, a consumer technology manufacturer, has launched a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by an advertisement made with a tongue on the cheek and in line with the style of music videos, which describes the freedom that the new pump brings to nursing mothers.
Four real-life mothers dance in a hay-filled barn, among other things, in the words of the song: "Yes, I milk myself, but the tail is not visible" and "if you didn't notice, it's not the udders, it's the tits."
The chorus continues, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies."
However, the advert posted on the company's Facebook page caused discussion online.
The video, which garnered 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has sparked a conflicting reaction in viewers, many saying it is making fun of the daily ‘horror’ of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after childbirth," one commentator writes.

Another viewer commented, "Understandably it's traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why can't they be used to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
The third commenter added, "A complete reality-exhaustible advertisement."
The ad also gave me defenders: one woman admitted that she thought the ad was "fun".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advert is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments.
Another viewer commented, "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and 'feel like cows'.
The ad is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the ad, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unobtrusive pumps crammed into their bras.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses and is discreetly fit inside the breastfeeding vests, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother advertising agency commented on the controversy: "The Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges associated with using the breast pump into the spotlight, we brought out the incredible sense of freedom brought out by the new pump in an entertaining and identifying way."
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk in the costume of designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to tent camp on Texas border in silence
The number of migrant children arrested has increased sharply, despite the relatively unchanged monthly number of border crossings, partly due to the difficulty of placing children in foster families as a result of the rough rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration.
Most foster families have traditionally consisted of undocumented immigrants, and enrollment as a foster family can jeopardize their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other adult members of the economy must give their fingerprints, and that this information will be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level immigration and customs official, testified last week in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to become foster families for minor immigrants.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of detainees did not have a previous criminal record.
"Almost 80% of people who are either members of a foster family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
So we will continue to search for these people," Albence says.
In an effort to deal more quickly with cases of children, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases the case must be dealt with in the court within one month of the arrest instead of the 60-day time limit previously in use, the reception centre employees say.
Many prefer to appear through videoconferencing rather than personally while pursuing their case in a court dealing with immigrants' affairs.
Those who are not considered eligible for help will be deported promptly.
According to reports published in recent months by reception center workers and the system, the time children spend in captivity affects whether children begin to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Lawyers say the concern is particularly highlighted in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's despair can go unnoticed due to the large size of the facility.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare for it emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause trauma, and that many children are suffering trauma even now.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke at the UN General Assembly, also urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is already at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also a substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign troops were illegally in the country using the excuse of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be acted upon accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and where millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "sacred battle until all of Syria has been cleansed" of both terrorist organizations and "illegal foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurds and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 soldiers in a battle-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for returning and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay out of the country.
"We have invited the international community and aid organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They politicize something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria until the end of the war has been agreed between Assad and the opposition by political agreement.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer area at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political debates.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack on an area of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related al-Nusra front fighters "who will be destroyed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a committee of members of the new government and opposition to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem imposed conditions on the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to "revision of the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interfering.
Why Trump Will Be Chosen for a Second Season
In line with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the suspension and scandal will end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidency decision ever!"
So far, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.
Since 2014, the best viewing time figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached cable TV: peaks with 3.5 million viewers as the most important news reports.
"This is a blaze that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," ABC's chief producer of Designated Survivor, Neal Baer, said of a minister who will become president after the attack destroyed the congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, is another theory.
He remembers a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked why.
The driver replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV shows, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade thing happens, whether members of immigrant families can get to each other, and how the world economy can.
Indifference is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet goes beyond the duty of the conscious citizen to look at the sixth hour of expert panel arguing about Bob Woodward's use of source information for the book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather pilot jacket (Washington Post says "a piece of clothing out of arrogance"), and the consequences of unvarnished descriptions of Stormy Daniels' President Trump's anatomy.
For example, I can never watch Super Mario the same way I used to.
"What he does feels like a reality show because in part it's about giving something to the public every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the pawn shop series, on the changing characters on Trump's show and the daily changing plot twists (NFL dispute, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss a single episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a wonderful sunny day at his place on the far north coast, but he couldn't go out because he was watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not break away from the program where Brett Kavanaugh was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs and it was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss said.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

From the outside, money flows into a tight midterm election struggle
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th constituency has been faced with a real cash flow, as due to the restructuring of the congress election districts, two candidates already elected are forced to fight for one place.
This recently re-limited Pittsburgh constituency is a battle challenge for the Democratic Conor Lamb, who gained his place in another constituency in last spring's special election.
Lamb is competing with another selected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th constituency, which overlaps with the new 17th constituency.
The regional division was re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old constituency division favoured Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th constituency has triggered an economic struggle in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar after the widely followed March special election of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional Election District in Pennsylvania.
The place had been Republican for over ten years and President Donald Trump won 20% in the area.
Political commentators have made a great head start for Democrats.
US plans to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but retreated from plans
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild response in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's leadership team.
U.S. Department of State officials decided to call American diplomatic leaders back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama "on the basis of recent policies that Taiwan will no longer be recognized," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, and development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit a Central American country with a high unemployment and homicide rate.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American authorities postponed the high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity. The corresponding meeting of the previous year was seen as a step in attempts to prevent migrants from seeking to enter the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrators made it clear that the meeting was to proceed and this effectively ended speculation about the possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give the meeting scheduled for mid-October some indication of the weight the administration will give to the meeting," the diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further unpleasant messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the discussion with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal issues anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke under the protection of the anonymity condition.
History teaches
The next inevitable step may be a special lawyer Robert Mueller's report on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which now has very weighty evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to be facing an investigation into whether Trump's campaign secretly cooperated with Russia when Russia interfered in the US election.
If power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just in preparation to go again before his constituents, and possibly be judged by his peers.
There are a lot of ifs here, and I'm not saying that President Trump's defeat is inevitable - any more than the defeat of similar people in Europe.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and those solutions determine how long this struggle will be.
In 1938, German authorities would have been prepared to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the next years of massacre.
The course of history revolves around such turning points where the inevitable forward march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What will we do if President Trump dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating Mueller's case?
Rosenstein has been grilled since it became public that he had proposed a secret recording of the President's speech and considered the president's possible inability to perform his duties.
Rosenstein says The Times' report is incorrect.
"How do we react if the recently required FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's actions is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony made?
And most importantly, are we voting for a congress in the midterm elections that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will be in a long and dark winter.
But I believe in our success because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and she was expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic home.
He survived, moved to America as an immigrant, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-decorated table.
How could I be anything but optimistic about the future with this legacy?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna
Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that earlier that month, after a draw against Villarreal in Spain, the victory over the Austrians would give the team a strong position to enter the Europa League G-block.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from getting on the field this season before Villarreal's 2-2 game, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good resistance," the 31-year-old player states.
"We went into the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
Maybe we could have caught the win at the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half and we got off the ground in the second half and we were better.
Thursday is another important evening in the Europa League.
Hopefully we will get three points, but it will be a tough game because their score was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with the support of this set we will be able to give everything we can and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough when it comes to my own injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the training is going well.
I hope we can now press to the fullest, leave the past season behind and succeed."
Fear of retirement savings takes women to sleep
Although the participants in the study had a clear view of how they hoped to take care of themselves, few had talked to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study said they would discuss the cost of long-term treatment with their spouse.
Only 10% of respondents said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't bring up the subject," says Holly Snyder, deputy director of the national life insurance company.
Start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell your wishes in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Bring financial advice to the discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
For example, long-term care financing options may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-cost insurance if you can afford it.
Make legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a health care representative there so you can name a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate with them.
Also consider drafting a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to assign a trusted person to take care of financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Also remember the little details: imagine your elderly parent being on his way to the hospital due to a health emergency.
Can you answer questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information in the plan so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just for the financial side. Who's his doctor?" Martin asks.
"What drugs are in use?
Who takes care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home late at night.
The victim, who was about forty years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police describe the attack at about 02:30 as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed to witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, and officials say the death toll is expected to increase.
As communications to the area are broken, rescue authorities have not received any information about the area of the municipality of Donggala north of Palu, which is closer to the surface of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the fire since the disaster.
Key information about Pilus and Donggala on Sulawes Island:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami struck in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of the coastal line of the northwestern part of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is an administrative area under the province, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main industries of the economy of the central province of Sulawes, and especially of the Donggala coastal region, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel extraction is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, the Return and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and often suffers from earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on northern Sumatra on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh caused a tsunami on December 26, which hit 14 states and killed 226,000 people off the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims were in the Aceh region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island in the coastal waters of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude quake struck south of Indonesia's most populated island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast of the island, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake struck one of the islands of Mentawai in Sumatra, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial quake struck Aceh's Pidie Jaya area, wreaking havoc and panic as people remember the enormous damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Lombok tourist island in Indonesia and killed more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists in solitary confinement.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of a former Alaskan governor and running mate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a Saturday report by Alaskan police, Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and obstruction and opposition to domestic violence in connection with the arrest.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone from his female companion when he tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Investigation Prison and the bail is set at $500, reports TV channel KTUU.
The report said Palin arrived in court on Saturday and replied that he was "guaranteely innocent."
Palin is charged with three class A violations, which means he can face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which can be punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
Palin is not charged with the crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
At that time, Palin's mother called the police and reported an assault.
The case is currently under discussion in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence involving possession of a gun under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused Palin of hitting her face.
Veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder due to service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawes, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia's capital.
Social media is circulating videos from the moment of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors consider imposing rare death penalty on suspect of NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack that claimed eight lives in New York City, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The charge is that Saipov, 30, used the Home Depot rental car in his October strike on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, where he drove on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application for the death penalty in the southern jurisdiction of New York City, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can demonstrate that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries.
According to the court document, it is possible to impose a death sentence on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal court filed a 22-point lawsuit against Saipov, which included charges of eight murders to assist a terrorist organization. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal title in cases of organized crime. In addition, the charges included a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "significant planning and preparation," prosecutors noted and described the way Saipov carried out his actions as "terrible, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, harm and losses to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the report said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time the New York Southern District Court issued the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York City in a federal case in 1953, when married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed convicted of conspiracy for Soviet espionage during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no signs of regret during the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that what he did felt good, police said.
The indictment said Saipov told authorities he was inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He responded to a 22-point prosecution that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and not recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused to those involved by these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked that he not be required to be sentenced to death.
The Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable in Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today at a demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the Civil Army."
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel pressured by Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested her lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative line representative Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that Great Britain would "be out" if Farage were Brexit secretary.
But May faces the relationship between her deeply divided ranks in reconciling a challenge that is underlined by conservatives in favor of staying, who joined a separate anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal afloat for Brexit supporters and opponents, as well as for the pressure of the EU.
The supporters demanded that he continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the setback - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "whisper the Chequers proposal away."
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added, "I defend Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He expressed his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not fight world wars to end up as subjects.
We want to pass our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the idea that public opinion would have changed since the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British would have changed their minds and would like to stay is a completely flawed claim."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by party members or activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success at all.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message to May, he added, "The prime ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians must be under pressure if they are to reverse the decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them we're not accepting it."
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want politicians who are about to reverse Brexit to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilize the army of citizens of this country, who gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until Great Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud state."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was founded this weekend.
Lord Adonis of the Labour Party mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say they can get IT systems in order and all the technology for Canada plus plus and frictionless border operations for free Irish trade," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren seriously considers presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider the presidential nomination after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at City Hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl in November, co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
Warren is expected to run for Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th City Hall meeting with voters after the Trump season began.
One participant asked if Warren was going to run for president.
Warren replied that now is the time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and it includes a woman at the highest location."
Arrest in LSU Sims shooting
Louisiana Baton Rouge police said on Saturday they had arrested a person suspected of a Friday shooting leading to the death of LSU basketball team player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. at an ET briefing.
Police had released a video of the Friday shooting and asked for help identifying the man in it.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus area early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot injury to her head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247 Sports network.
Wayde defended his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted during interrogation that he was present, held a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson did not resist when he was arrested and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 198-cent junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games and 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world championship after team arrangements offer him victory over Sebastian Vettel
When Valtteri Bottas passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became apparent that Mercedes team arrangements play an important role in the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the pole and left Hamilton almost to his own devices in defending his place in the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of tails, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the pits later on the tour and returned after Vettel, but Hamilton passed after taking some contact and the Ferrari driver reluctantly moved from the inner line, giving up defending his position after his two third turns movement.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started in the back row and was seventh after the first round.
He was then in charge of much of the competition as he prolonged the change of tyres as he aimed for a quick ending and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He eventually came to the depot in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed in the remaining eight rounds as Räikkönen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri performed brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job, achieving a double win," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim on Saturday that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at an event in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of people's "obviousness, malice and dishonesty".
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, seeing anger, people who are angry, mean, mean and dishonest," the president said.
"When we see publications and leaked things and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak this information?
Remember his answer...you leaked the document - ‘Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we...no, we didn't leak," he added, mocking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing Ford's allegations about Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to his wishes."
But his ban was not good enough for the president, who commented on the matter at Saturday's event: "I'll tell you that was a very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought Democrats would use the accusations for their own benefit.
"They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
You see that malice and malice, and they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get to power and rule," Mediaite reported the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars claimed a refund for the loss of Friday's Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had an initial lead thanks to two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home team levels before Dwyer restored Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard leveled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men to win as underdogs in Dundee 2-1 Belfast on Friday night.
The teams faced the Giants for the fourth time during the season after winning three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute of 3:35 out of Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford pitched when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a messy opening episode, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game in 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched Cownie's handicap goal in 15:16.
Dwyer secured Giants' leadership for the first round break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first round of the evening.
The home team gathered their ranks and Bouchard leveled again with a superior goal in time 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces and Nielsen was able to score Dundee's first lead at the end of the second round. He also secured the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the last round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at their next home on Friday.
Flight pilot killed to ensure hundreds of passengers on board escaped earthquake
In Indonesia, the flight controller has become a hero since he died, ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers could safely enter the air.
More than 800 people have died and several are missing since the severe earthquake and the tsunami it caused hit Sulawes Island on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are testing the area and several people have been trapped among the collapsed material in the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled by means of their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his workstation at the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palu.
He remained in place and ensured that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was currently on the runway, could safely enter the air.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower, which he thought was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesian spokesman Yohannes Sirait said Agung's decision could save hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News broadcast said.
A helicopter was prepared from Balikpan, Kalimantan, to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter could make it back.
"This news breaks our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll will increase to thousands because disaster officials in the country have reported that links to the cities of Donggala, Sig and Boutong are incomplete.
"The population is expected to continue to rise because several bodies have been buried in ruins and many people have not been reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said.
Waves that have grown up to six metres have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft bring assistance and equipment to the area.
35-year-old housewife Risa Kusuma told Sky News: #Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what's waiting for us.
This is already a tragedy, but it may prove even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday of Return and said in a speech to the country's armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugin says one person is missing after an airplane crashes into a lagoon
Representatives of the airline of the aircraft that crashed into the lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now report that one person is missing, although earlier reports indicate that all 47 passengers and crew members had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugin said it had not been able to locate one male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline announced that it was trying to find the man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane struck the water in an attempt to land at Chuok Airport.
Authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six people stayed in the hospital on Saturday and everyone was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the aircraft landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane had drifted over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said passengers were able to wade in a sinking plane in waist-deep water for emergency exits.
He said that the passenger staff panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on the repair of a nearby dock were involved in rescue work by transporting people to shore by a rubber boat before the aircraft sank into the deep water of about 30 metres (hundred feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crash of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not joined the crash.
Analyst presents timeline for night when woman was burned alive
The prosecutor completed a re-trial on Saturday, in which the man was accused of burning a Misssipian woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of information analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used the data stored on his mobile phone to bring together the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night the victim died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was against his previous claims with Chambers the night he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the information showed that Tellis' cell phone was at Chambers' house at the same time that Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Based on the information stored on the mobile phone, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The closing remarks on the defence are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to proceed to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music full of positive messages.
According to The High Breed, a Bristol band, hip hop has distanced itself from the original, whose messages were related to politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed the new rise of the UK with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
New York nanny sues couple for racist text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after accidentally receiving a text message from the child's mother complaining that she is "again one black person".
The couple denies being racists and equates the challenge with "torture."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her troubles when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived at work on her first day of work in 2016 and found out she was black.
"EIIIIIIII, THE GUARANTEE THREE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a text message.
However, she then sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing the mistake they had made, Plasco-Flaxman had fired Maurice, announcing that their previous African-American nanny with departure passes had done his job poorly and had been waiting for a Filipino this time.
Maurice was paid for one of his working days and sent home by taxi.
Maurice now sues the couple for dismissal and wants $350 per day for six months, which he had originally been hired to live and work in a family, though without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have responded to racist claims, saying that Maurice's termination of employment was a well-founded solution because they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something she wasn't meant to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said in an interview with the Post.
"But would you leave your child in the care of someone you've been unfriendly to, even if only accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco equated the challenge with blackmail and I said his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start chasing another person in a situation like this?
It's not very nice to do," the investment bank added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, following their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that the audience would not identify with the talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, says of the letter: "It is difficult to empathize with the position of the person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's amusing now that Paddington's immense popularity is known."
Noting that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing children's books about the adventures of a toy bear, would have been optimistic about abandoning his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bittersweet because his father died the previous year.
Paddington he "described as a very important family member" and stated that his father was quietly proud of the success it achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a raving guy at all," the daughter says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; one you are proud of, even though it is not really your own work.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His daughter had been rushed after the plane landed at Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save his life.
"Nad called all the time and told me the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperouse says.
Then Nad called and said my daughter would die in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm with you."
The drugs that doctors used to keep his heart running gradually faded out of his body.
He had died a little earlier and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, who mourned his daughter's loss, boarded a plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the ordeal he was currently going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and tears were dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had tremendous sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Grieving women send cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can provide support.
Davis' son Tyler contracted depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I wouldn't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says his son was a promising cook with a contagious grin.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile would light up the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt "dark".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother, who had taken his life from himself.
Davis says he is constantly afraid of the aftereffects.
Davis created the cards "to tell people that there are people you can go to talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in silence - you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for several years and lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was right down on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact with them or anything like that."
He notes that Mark's death was a difficult trauma to them, but they must nevertheless make it: "It will break up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to move on and fight ahead."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really achieve what he hoped for - a time-limited and scale-limited investigation - we might perhaps be able to achieve some unity," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would 'disperse' the deadlock caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court will be hampered.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to lobby them to give their support to Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time and met his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary through him.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
A vote is taking place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to blow across the game and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defector number drops during Kim's time
According to the South Korean legislature, the number of people who defected to South Korea from North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification and reported that 1,127 defections occurred last year - 2,706.
Park said the decisive factors had been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in prices for human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not been publicly commented on.
Most of North Korea's defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often forcibly returns them.
North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang and the discussions focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear armaments.
This followed the June historic meeting, where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and generally agreed on an effort towards nuclear non-nuclearism on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for being put in place after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable footing and under such circumstances we will under no circumstances unilaterally begin to dismantle our equipment first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and unfit to act in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was temporarily unfit to act in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on the matter in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh very emotionally denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed by his feelings and sometimes almost shouted and lost his ability to speak when he told about his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democratic members of the committee without calling themselves accusations of "grotesque and planned persecution of a person" organized by the liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards the Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered if he would be charged with Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified except for the Supreme Court, including the court he's currently working in," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the United States Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible regulations regarding health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected a member of the court and we'd be expected to state that it's wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women need to get through everything.
It is a legitimate fire talk with months and years of rage over and he cannot keep it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped tremendously by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying when she was angry too, but that she had developed a way of saying to her speech partner in a situation where she got angry and started crying, 'You might think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are justified as a route of outburst of rage, although they are usually fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories of my early job in a male-dominated office is that once I cried speechlessly out of rage and an older woman - a cold-tempered supervisor I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and pulled me into the staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they got your mind hurt."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship in 1987 on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the highly frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason why he would not run for president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought out decision," he told me, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates and the least needed was even more.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.'"
Since the campaign period was well advanced, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
It dawned on him that some of his supporters, who gave the male candidates $1,000, gave him only 250.
"Do they think I'm getting some discount?" he thought.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was overwhelmed by his feelings - gratitude to his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for election work against voters and delegates, and hatred for sexism - that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I'd have a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You might have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking my tombstones would probably be beaten for obituary.
"She was crying."
How the US-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The starting point for the US-China trade war was deafening and although the battle is far from over, the break between the two countries can benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing import taxes on China's most important export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting imported goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing half of all products imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has responded in equal measure every time, most recently by imposing five to ten percent tariffs on American imported goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States in the eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the world's second largest economic power is falling apart for a moment.
To get Washington to retreat, one should give in to one's own demands, but public bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts state that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing inter-country dependence.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start an economic downward spiral in either country and this is actually a more dangerous opportunity than bystanders have understood so far," says Abigail Grace, an Asian-informed research assistant at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country is "ready" for refugee return
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country would improve.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal situation.
Conditions now allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country from which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be grateful for its help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at the Le Golf National course outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe, and it has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team kept the crown to itself when its Danish team of Captain Thomas Bjørn reached 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson had trouble almost throughout the tournament and hit his starting punch in the water with a 16-hole par-3 track, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Molinari of Italy shone in all rounds and became one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was forced out with 5&4 against Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest player on the European team.
Dustin Johnson, ranked as the world's top player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup golf veterans, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most winning European ever in the tournament with a total of 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have this victory.
It's a team and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, moved after the European team's victory.
He moves the torch to his compatriots Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in 2&1 individual competitions played on Sunday.
"I feel tremendous pride after winning Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now holds a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 big wins and will only be second to Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was of high standard throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, captain of the US team, said after his team failed the show: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We pressured the European team in this morning's games.
We fought back.
Glory to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'll have to put on my hat.
We met our winner."
Red tide algae flowering situation: concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota regions
According to the latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the algae count shows a general decline in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragmented algae areas are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, possibly indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide algae bloom extends along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
Ferries can be detected ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they are less frequent than last week.
Red tide algae bloom has also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the Pinellas County coast in the past week, concentrations ranged from low to high Hillsborough County coasts, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manate and Sarasota counties, background concentration to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and background concentration to high concentrations along Lee District Climb coasts and Collier County with low lengths.
Respiratory symptoms are still reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
Over the past week, there were no reports of respiratory symptoms in the northwest of Florida.
