9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The missing persons report for a boy who has left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomat at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the post-clearance.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again wildly tore the goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League goal kingship turned for at least a moment in favor of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved alone to the top of the all-time scorer statistics when he shot a visitor into Shahtar Donetski's network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona Messi, who was even-reading with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A in the early season, but in Champions League D Group it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end by Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of the knee-sneed Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend Premier League game, did not arrive on the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a hard one in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's away match only lasted 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the goal towards the attacked ManU kit so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium a dozen minutes before medical personnel went to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of the goal-making in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half PSG.
PSG has been ranked among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career departure club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow's TsSKA lost B-block in a match to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Germany.
Opposition party immediately called for resignation - president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech again in the country's parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91, is in full breath.
The MDC, the main opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that confusion had occurred solely in Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt earlier and now with China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will evaluate the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the Home Affairs Ministers' table, according to Merkel.
Teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during emergency call
Voice only slightly colored university teacher Shannon Lamb tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably upset, and said that the contact details of the close relatives of the dead woman can be found on his phone.
Inside the house, police found a handwritten message on Amy Prentiss' body and the page of the booklet: "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo this I loved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said a letter that experts say is signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University, Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus, where police believe he shot and killed a well-liked history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Lynn Buford, the police chief at Delta State University, said university officials heard of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths rose by one more: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the voice.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to a school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have released information that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher who, however, may have had problems.
Students said they waited for his classes.
Police at the Prentiss estate, Gautier, say Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something was wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had reported that he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked for sick leave at Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
University principal William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb fled campus, police were able to track him down when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile and a half south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3,500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer at the time.
All the girls were molten wax when he was there, now 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburb Brandon, told the story.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told me they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, now having a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen reported that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing in the summer market three years ago.
Later they played together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment organizer at The Julep Room, near Gautier, says that he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica performance for a few audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were messing around and throwing shots at each other.
So they were both quite clever.
The dead teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and specialized in Indians and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his fraternity and student board.
On Tuesday night, a candle devotion was held at the Delta State campus in Cleveland, attended by about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It is time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi from Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi's Greenville and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected according to police saying that Lamb now made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that although Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says that current regulars and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, compared to 45,000 hired during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although it is months before the holiday season, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary film Back in Time.
The film begins and I think I'm just a fake yawn and a hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future, which was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg reported, "For me, it's undoubtedly the greatest time travel movie ever."
Back in Time is available in video on demand, DVD and some cinemas in October.
UN leader says Syrian situation will not be resolved armedly
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's response to Russia increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict is "not resolved armedly", and additional weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN leader again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told Wednesday's press conference that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - in connection with General Assembly Ministerial Week later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and regional forces "has made the situation impossible to resolve."
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis as they demonstrated when agreeing on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 Support Survey Results That Show Donald Trump Is Seriously
Some have tried to label him a wind vane.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some are waiting for the collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump off top of the polls, it has not (yet) been successful.
Of the latest 11 national polls in ten, Donald Trump has been in charge in a double-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the nomination opportunities of the real estate king.
The parliamentary term is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump will likely become a Republican candidate.
Commentators point out that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his lead to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom received any states in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Organization Club for Growth have noted Trump's persistence and have begun to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent support survey results suggest that the property king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularization figures have made a turnaround.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University support polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
In early August, the figure was 52 per cent.
Six out of ten Republicans are currently positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first primary states.
In a support survey conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson gains about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of "inspired" vs. Trump's 40%).
The next most exciting?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush, a favorite of the powers, became a candidate.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pompous speeches and insults, Monday's ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 52% of Republican voters at national level think the real estate king has a character that suits the president.
According to a survey by Quinnipiac last week, the number in the Iowa state holding the first party convention is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has a character that suits the leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think that his character is not suitable for being president, and nearly six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asked who was most likely nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball at their disposal.
During the last parliamentary term at this time, four out of ten Republicans felt Rick Perry was being nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that most Republican Party voters consider the Trump campaign credible.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the fragmented field is likely to have promoted Trump's leadership, as anti-Trump support has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's tied up with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump-winning candidate?
If they were pitted against each other, Ben Carson would win businessman Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just now the majority of Donald Trump supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll from Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters in favor of Trump have decided who their vote will go to.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can say for sure that they will never change their mind.
46% said they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest rival at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump's side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign start speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's pomp will drive Latino voters further away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding attempts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new peak.
Support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said in Monday's ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a non-political person than one with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "unsatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry."
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his election
Labour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will face David Cameron for the first time in Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn rises to ask about his first six questions shortly after noon, and probably both the media and Labour MPs are watching closely his performance.
Corbyn has called for "less theatre and more facts" for this weekly show.
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities to his colleagues.
This encounter is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the national anthem in Tuesday's memorial service, which took place on the 75th anniversary of the Battle for Britain air war, has sparked criticism among Conservative Party MPs and has appeared in several front-page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said he "standing respectfully quietly" and that he recognizes "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn's shadow government, told BBC Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem despite the fact that he felt the royal house should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and originally less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the liners regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have also "accumulated" within the Labour Party since Corbyn was appointed.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Confederation of Trade Unions that the Labour Party would propose a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, the shadow government's Secretary of Labor and Pensions Smith stated that the party was "very clear" about only opposing the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £230,000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face by David Cameron in the past decade when he has been the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has "crowded" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and received over 30,000 proposals.
Corbyn, a Member of Parliament for Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too pitting against each other and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and pricking, promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the financial secretary of the shadow government, is her substitute for poll hours when Corbyn is not attending - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues could sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the House of Commons President, John Bercow, on the subject.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said he wanted to move further away from a political theater that is often associated with the Prime Minister's poll hours, but he later had to admit that he had failed.
Since they began to be televised in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the director's judgment, his control of the House of Commons, and his position among other MPs, although critics have criticized the survey hours for becoming just a travesty that requires far-reaching reforms.
Filmed in Joburg: Homeless Young People Trained as Photographers
Johannesburg city centre is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first young people to graduate from the project.

The value of the pound rises as UK wage growth accelerates
The pound value jumped upwards after the numbers showed an increase in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer item SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 percent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it estimates of higher rates.
The pound rose above 1% against $1,5505, and 0.84% against €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at a 1.49% increase to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive share in the market and rose by 20 percent after being approached by competitor AB InBev with an offer.
The deal would combine two of the world's largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 percent after encouraging news about the competing luxury product group Richmont was received.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant reported that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest calculators in the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation for the company to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after a sportswear company released information about its six-month return before taxes: an 83% increase to £46.6 million.
JD Sports executive says higher wages could damage expansion
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is increased in the UK, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers will increase."
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill says.
The costs might be directed at the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against invasion of Aldi's industry
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA trades from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and Western Australia before the $700 million attack on Aldi.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming to. Meanwhile, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food brokers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide show exhibition.
IGA merchants and suppliers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's, an ice cream manufacturer from Dunsborough, offer tastings in IGA stores, and store owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details about its defense strategy on September 29, when this food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler organizes an annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia together make up nearly 30% of the area of Metcash's IGA trades, with higher yield margins than the IGA network of the eastern states of Metcash.
Visitors to South and Western Australia's purchases are known to be parochial, with IGA dealers having a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the south next year and 30 in the west, generating $500 and $600 million in revenue in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash's high fixed expenses base can cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, manager of the leading investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglass' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Metcash Board of Directors had contacted Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14%, and returns from Metcash's food and food business, which transmits products to approximately 1,200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, indicating a reduction in debt financing for operations as there is pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler holds its own, and has invested over $150 million annually in reducing weekly prices of hundreds of products to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers renovate stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to market.
Ian Morrice, President and CEO of Metcash, says that falling prices and improving stores have increased attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of her behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered as a bystander in a recent storm that has raged around her friend Nick Kyrgios. She deserves honor rather than criticism for her own behavior," said Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo called "Special Ks", was involuntarily made public about a case in which Kyrgios provoked Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters competition.
Shortly thereafter, in a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati, the chief judge had to fire Chefnakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beat that brat."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his bat after the cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been the staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for another place in doubles with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I think pretty strongly Thanasi has just been drawn into the brawl," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost the cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat when he gets frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved excellently, including in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He has a great team around him, has a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little harshly.
She is very mature for 19 years old, she works hard, fits into the team and so on, and has never had any problems with other players. She is appreciated in the dressing room, she is training firmly, is in good shape and is quite a calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in important games starting on Friday, describing this "joint decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberran's return to the team's regular equipment.
"We want the team to be fully focused on games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really quickly, as Federer and Murray, for example, have pointed out, and he grows up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. However, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public eye thinking about these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of damming the stream of migrants entering the country.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in neutral territory, and Serbian authorities reacted with dismay.
People who fled violence in their home countries have now erected their tents and settled on the road section for an indefinite period between the checkpoints of two countries.
However, frustration increased.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants kept saying "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to accept" the return of migrants from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm to civilians.
The debate must take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion on the Hungarian-Serbia border arose after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibilities for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, who were hopeful about reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries will take 120,000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's state of emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in the crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum lawsuits to be speeded up.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country is also going to erect a barbed wire fence in part of its border with Romania to stop the influx of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and destination for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of those arriving are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not those fleeing from the war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia, as a crime, and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern town of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: Illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
Parliament must still formally approve the military positioning expected for next week, but Associated Press journalists at the border have seen heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said authorities had arrested 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, as well as 15 people who had already reached the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now captured by police, and are accused of violations as defined in the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points at the border with Serbia after sending a barbed wire-covered train car to close one of these seats.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for handling people and crowds tried to stuff inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorway between Serbia and Hungary, saying they refuse food and drink until they are allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 election: National poll shows Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead in a double-digit Democratic nomination race, but Senator Bernie Sanders will hold her.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (calculated from 58%), and Sanders is supported by 27% (rising from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
More than five months before the primary begins, most Democratic voters state that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand behind their own choice more firmly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined among several population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but her leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has declined considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's head start with Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, clearly leads with older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digit number with liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's Democratic voters say they will be enthusiastically supporting Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
A quarter says they support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely eager to support her.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are not currently in favor of Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, Republicans' number one man Donald Trump says the same thing fewer Republican voters (35 percent).
When asked in an open question why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she has the right experience (16 percent). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice President will influence a possible presidential nomination, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even though one third disagree.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership in Sanders will increase. If Biden goes along, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure will be 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
By this standard Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him the most voting has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in the candidate, Democratic voters put opinions ahead of voting.
Also last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on certain key issues among their party voters.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are honest, reliable, and strong leaders.
Biden does the best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27% say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideologically in agreement.
Looking at all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters say they have no opinion on Sanders.
Although the use of Hillary Clinton's personal email address and server while she is Secretary of State still raises questions, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation of the matter and say that their general opinion on her was not affected.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say Clinton is not considered honest and reliable.
Meanwhile, 55% of registered voters in the whole country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but not many have an opinion about him, just like Carson does.
The margin of error in the study, which involved 351 Democratic voters, is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates collected half of all the votes in the new poll, leaving the others to fight for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of Trump, whose support has risen from 23% in the previous CBS poll, conducted before last month's Fox News election debate, to 27% in a survey released Tuesday.
Carson, however, rose from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is displacing Trump among highly educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has fallen behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, and support for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10% last month to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place at 6%.
The margin of error in this latest survey, conducted in September, in a sample of 376 Republican voters is +/- 6%.
A latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson was on the rise in polls: he has 19% support for Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him with 32%.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was also far ahead of Carson.
As Carson gained popularity last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgery for nothing, even though Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died at a fraternal chimping ceremony in the Pocono Mountains area of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been filed against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood of Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death.
Authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and a backpack of over 13 kg was loaded on his back full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk through an icy field towards the paint.
Eventually, Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
The Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, but were accused of waiting an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the web for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's national chairman Andy Meng, asking him for advice," police chief Chris Wagner told a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus practically put the welfare of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
Deng was not able to be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy record, Deng suffered repeated blunt-object blows to the head, body, and thighs.
"Too many families have been affected by fraternity bundling when at least one student has died each year as a result since 1970," Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step of the authorities is important.
Monroe County's grand jury advocated that the first five members be charged with third-degree murder
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent chimping and criminal intrigue.
"We don't want to hold only individuals accountable. If there is an organization behind what happened that accepted the situation either officially or informally, they should also be held accountable," Wagner said at Tuesday's press conference.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood dismantled their connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
The raise in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help with timing, as far as the economy is concerned.
The recession has lasted only 11 months since the first withdrawal, while sometimes it has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why U.S. Federal Reserve officials have so vigorously stressed that investors should not focus on it, because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the trajectory of the time that is going to normalize the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants can see that all the fuss associated with raising interest rates has been oversized.
"The first increase in the central bank after the global economic crisis will inevitably be interpreted in some circles as the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economic expert on global affairs at Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect that the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, though still low, level will be a revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have an impact.
Below is a look at how some sectors of the economy will react based on past developments:
As seen in the market in the last month or so, waiting for an increase in interest rates can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn potentially reflects the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank's increase.
More specifically, in the last 35 years or so, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14% as you approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is fairly steady (average increase of 2.6 percent), and normal status has been achieved after 500 days with an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Nuveen Asset Management's leading capital strategist Bob Doll, published in Barron's.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on stocks is usually clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle as returns begin to fall.
Recessions are part of the economy, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not existed before and can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the case with GDP, which will be closest to its lowest ever level before the central bank's interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP of 118 increases since 1950 has only twice been below 4.5%.
Although the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will remain after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5%, the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank reports.
Increasing interest rates in such a fragile economic setting can be risky and raise the question of "whether this time is different," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for the central bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
While many strategists and financial experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading only anticipates a 25% probability.
"Our study shows that since 1950, all upgrade cycles have so far experienced an increasing leverage effect in supercycles where GDP has passed its pre-recession peak very quickly since recovery began," the report says.
In contrast, there has now been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting by far the longest since the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and now it is already the 74th month.
Fixed returns have also been volatile while the market is waiting for interest rate increases, and the model is somewhat similar to the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that as the central bank changes its line, its effects are more quickly reflected in bonds than in shares.
The direction of the proceeds from the bonds appears to change immediately at the first increase/cut of the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the return on bonds will decrease immediately," Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that raising interest rates will cause convergence of longer and shorter-term bond yields, thus smoothing the yield curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still cautious about finding a return," said Kathy Jones, an analyst at Schwab's fixed return, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes the market has already adapted to the central bank's policy expectations.
"In addition to the fall in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is more even, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies that are mainly based in the United States win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt perform worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks in general are more profitable in the three months after the first raise," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to customers.
Companies with strong turnover surpassed low turnover companies by an average of five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases.
Companies with high return on capital and low volatility shares performed better than lower quality companies, with an average of 4 (per percentage points) and 3 (percentage).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable rate debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside of stock market speculation, consumers too have the opportunity to benefit from the increase in the value of the dollar.
Savers can also make a profit with higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect is felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses channel of "recognition"
He claims that separating it from a commercial competitor becomes increasingly difficult
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating the Brit Awards.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying that it is not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, claims the leading MP, increasing the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to "people's awareness" of its content, and that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term 'people's sense' - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also set out the BBC Music Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only seem to be held under a different name at the Brit Awards.
So if you are trying to do something different, here are two examples I directly remember when you are actually just copying something that is already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC Director General denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and sharing information with citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is actually first-class.
"I also think it's really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 chief, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must do more work than before to reach the audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offering, which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Damien Collins, a member of parliament for the Conservative Tory Party, criticized The Voice, a music competition that the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at £22 million.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is not original and is by no means distinctive?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, has been produced "in exactly BBC style".
He added that he wants the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time it starts an entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future The Voice periods, or to order that the money of the licensors be spent on other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose least so far in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
Last month was the lowest since the statistics began in 2000
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe November's Black Friday may curb consumption
Virtual shopping has grown tremendously for over a decade and has turned many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased least since the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales strengthened as buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as a couch.
But now it smooths out, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing trades.
Experts believe that consumers will curb shopping before the last Friday event in November.
Last year, five times as many buyers flocked to their computers to grab stores, knocking down many merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over discoveries, can curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was used online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using the fashion chains of shopping streets.
Muslims bury Mecca victims in crane accident, Bin Laden family sanctions
Muslims carry bodies of 29 dead across streets during first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partially accused Saudi Binladin Group of collapsing
Health Ministry reported that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed
29 dead were carried in the air through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane collapsed in the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mainly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first dead to make their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad procession passed the sacred place where just a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and knocked down worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family construction team was responsible for a disaster that also injured 394 people.
Of the worshipers killed by cranes killed in Mecca's Grand Mosque, 29 bodies were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton in the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already vowed that the hajj Mecca will continue as thousands constantly arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not have left the crane's stem up when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decision published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency said that Binladin Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors have been forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the crane, and its representatives have not been caught for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around the major mosque in Mecca, which are part of the huge building robbery that Binladin Group leads.
Binladin's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and it leads major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of Al Qaeda, was a rebellious boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for pilgrimage, which every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and to those permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind the popularity
British people are increasingly using helpers' services, Veronique Laury says
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores for professionals will be opened
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, the city's main correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint pens and prefer skilled Eastern European workers to do home renovation work
It seems that if you are handy with a hammer or beat to paint walls, you are now in the minority.
The British are increasingly hiring helpers to do do-it-yourself work in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the home renovation chain, said that behind the popularity is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a mock price.
This leads Kingfisher to plan to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions made in the store are specifically made by the more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there are more single-woman economies where more home renovation work is being done than before.
Laury said, "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions for products are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women who run the most important companies in the British FTSE100 index, and has rebuilt his management team with the same number of male and female supervisors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with exactly 50% of women in the group, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher announced a decline in both six months' returns and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
The three-ace government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other wage earners' central organizations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a widespread demonstration by the workers.
Many people think that reason also stands.
Let's ask if it's worth the strikes when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no web to protest on, but openly declaring yourself a rich person would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people in a million-member trade unions does not bother much, but it does give us something to think about.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the perspective of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of looking like things are rolling on their own, now the unions are finally getting to the point of defending, visibly and properly defending the rights of the employee.
The government can thus perhaps want to capture the role of the trade union movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta has a hard savings course: Aiming for 8.5 million in savings, staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings course, which aims to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations for all personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million are being saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates that the actual operations will be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the government's cuts in appropriations.
In this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million in deficit.
Expenses will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate finance on our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks as prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Sir Brian Souter, owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the move.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
The Federal Reserve must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision about whether they will raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
While Reuters conducted a survey of 80 economists, just over half of those who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are kept at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero and start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior fellow of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars into the balance sheets and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they must be ready for withdrawal, but the signs also show that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University shooter leaves apology message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before shooting his colleagues later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was "bad" about the first murder and hoped "that he could cancel it," officials said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police reported that Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that police must send officers to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "does not bother anyone", but is probably upset.
Police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb gave no explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, there was the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by the hand of 45-year-old Lamb that read, "I'm so sorry I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday while police surrounded him.
University principal William LaForge said there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, as far as he knew, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind."
Authorities said Tuesday that despite Monday's claims that Lamb believed Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was "no law information or evidence" of any kind of "triangle drama."
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen reported that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O'Steen reported that Prentiss and his daughter were "one-time best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked online from his home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his relatives at some point on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail."
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car at the side of the road, left it there, and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb defended his doctoral thesis on education at Delta State in spring 2015, says a CV found on the university's website.
Stars who lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he contracted leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Rumors are that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really takes its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw got a double fracture to his right leg as Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day after, and then operated on in Manchester.
This is terrible, and the boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from trouble, and then plays great, and this is what happens now.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it's gonna take at least six months for a double fracture, and he's not playing in the block stage.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got or a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tackle.
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery is starting now, I'm coming back stronger."

The English defender will have an additional incentive to recover next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's a really bad injury."
If a player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to offend the opponent.
Moreno's leg was broken when he played for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this heavily because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, that's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke tackle.
Moreno said to SBS6, "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling challenged him.
David Cameron knows Lorax better than this, right?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't take long until you learn it almost by heart.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister about his favorite children's book, he chose Dr Seuss' The Lorax book, an environmental-protective story published in 1971.
The choice was tricky, Cameron writes in a post posted on the SuperCamps company's website and continues, "Fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message we've never seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill a fairly short original text.
"In the city of Tarville within the majors, where all nature has disappeared and even air is merchandise, Ted the boy hopes to win over the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the right tree," the text says and describes a love story not written by Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, real name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text sounds in places as if it was taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville within the majors, where everything is artificial and even the air is merchandise, Ted the boy hopes to win over the heart of his dream Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unacquainted with the plot of the book. In it, a young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greedy, wood-cut and need-woven Kerskanen, regardless of the short, moustache that gave the story the name of Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text must have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think a repeat of the last 3-0 series loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut down a away win.
The Alastair Cook side may be less experienced than the three-year-old team, but it involves good twisters and the team's mindset is strong: they don't have scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali develops in his spiral feeds and Adil Rashid is an attacker option, although it is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth fell off England cricket team, replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is understandably difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging circumstances, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged by their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best choicers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
English head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform quite as well as he could, and it doesn't surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the batter will get to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and at guests.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in top shape, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming with me, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He's got something as a cricketer that we saw early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same chance as the others before him, but this of course depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There's been a ball of thought about Moeen in a batting opening next to Cook, which would give the field an extra pitcher but keep four fast, and I'm not against this.
I don't understand why the batter couldn't hit there, and this left-handed person has already shown himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job in his county of Worcestershire, but he is three for them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games on the first grid drop before moving on to the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup pitcher, and, with the little I've had to do with him, he feels like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unvarnished statistics - hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35 - and think it's a gamble, but there's not too many pitchers available and the electors chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along with the white ball games, bringing both energy and a relentless hint.
I have always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it be playing or coaching, and he has the same kind of hunger to use as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate Durham, Ben Stokes, is being rested in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with this.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and picks don't make schedules.
And one must remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made on light grounds.
Those in favour of Britain leaving the EU (Brexit) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron's semi-villain renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing ever-increasing problems every day, even if one ignores even the heartfelt Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn's election to the Labour leadership or the anger of the Confederation of Trade Unions for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomatic buddy recently explained that, because the EU is so deeply involved in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are tired of Britain's self-centered agenda, which is full of dissenting concessions and disturbing treaty changes that these countries do not want for the most part.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Confederation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them either if they eroded social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of the famous local monument, either with or without a local eye-catching person, and then come home saying they will win supporters for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - 'Don't leave us alone with France', they say - suggests that the most short-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care we'll leave then.
German cautious and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets ruined in the same way it did for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a fading force too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the Selfie British, as their energy would rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want that either because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation was a case" and "The renegotiation was of no importance to Britain."
Europeans have been bitterly experiencing how voracious the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-sceptic the sovereigns of the press are, which they were not at the time of the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest European opportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU direct bananas" while a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a diverse group of tax-foreigning rascals, foreigners hacking phones, and people who are nominally based elsewhere and own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, you have to give up bananas for a diversion unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more liberal than Blair himself when it comes to opposing Cameron's renegotiation stunt, because Bair had agreed to the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly patted me on the back at the Westminster Parliament House on Monday (I told him he no longer had time to waste on me), seems to be in danger of re-introducing Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott of the Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take time, he is forced to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt Andrew Marr, who left the BBC couch Corbyn on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party's war goal enthusiasm and the most ferocious nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly put themselves behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn fan" Benn said this on both radio and TV this week when her inner Scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint rugged John McDonnell as the shadow government's finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father grandfather was struggling on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour government colleagues without going so far as to lose his seat in government.
Hilary's pinnings were more attractive.
But the fight to keep up with "anywhere in the situation" - Benn's phrase - was not what McDonnell said, nor everything Corbyn told the primers and MPs at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the unhierarchical, emotional, and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), communication discipline is important in the age of 24-hour TV, and especially in social media vortexes, which is a good breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to take Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the basic twist between McDonnell and Corbyn regarding EU membership (and being in line with their Benn-spirited regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult-to-understand conversation among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is a key dogma in doctrinal squabbles.
As for his duality with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely pointless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the British's poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with the cost-cutting Conservative government in power, as I was reminded of at the start of Monday's British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England's e-cigarette assessment
Researchers have said that the claim of a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing for the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet, criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published this "post" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month that attacked the "exceptionally shaky bottom" of PHE's main leadership decision.
Two other researchers who wrote in BMJ have wondered if the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects PHE's claim that "the best estimate today is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on detailed evaluation and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages associated with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarized in the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they increase.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not stated, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom also report that they have received funding from the industry in the study.
Others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the PHE Tobacco Director.
The study produced by the group "much-talkingly admits" that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence regarding harm in most products and most of the criteria," McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's Director of Health and Well-being, says that the claims made in BMJ have been responded to before.
He says, "Electrical cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Half of those who have burned their lives die from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are relatively low, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even though e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former Channel 4 leader says
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" about such hits as this soap opera on Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other British broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience on difficult broadcasting times against the most watched programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to establish a relationship with the BBC for six years, in vain.
"I don't understand the idea of the BBC producing and broadcasting programmes that would be clearly suitable for unsubsidized competitors," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I am not sure it would be a good idea for this media or, in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is broadcast at the most important broadcast time because it is intended to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would show the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could also be funded without government subsidies.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, admittedly executed inside the house.
Frankly, other channels would give anything for it.
I don't understand how it's about public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would weaken the BBC at all."
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is guilty of hunting ratings "for the goals of the people working there, and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes "go to BBC4, where often the number of viewers cannot be measured, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and can then hypocritically state that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is looking at'."
They put them on a mission where no one ever comes to see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system in who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think that £150 a year will get a lot of value, but I don't know if that's true for people for whom £150 is a big money because they don't use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its Reith-era mission to "information, educate and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC production is now classified as education - he said the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take the example of Australian and Canadian broadcasting and change the task to "information, education and entertainment".
As for partnership issues, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events like Proms concerts, which he says are only shown by a few on television, and team up with commercial companies so that all of these could be viewed online.
"Änigenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny nematodes change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound impulse too high to be heard by a human ears.
Impulse works by turning on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said that worms show the functionality of a new method called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that conducts electrical impulses into people's brains to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematodes normally do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles reinforced ultrasonic waves, which then pass inside the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports a report published in Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasonically controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motion nerve cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified worms, microcups amplified sound waves and transmitted them to worms where they turned on modified motion nerve cells.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn nerve cells on and off using light impulses.
Chalasani, however, says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent along optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unhindered, so they can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus can make the targeted human neurons momentarily respond to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
Ads put British arms trade to shame
Watch the video against Amnesty International's arms fair.
Horrible killer planes!
Ankle-crushing leg irons!
Grape bombs!
As well as electrical stunning batons that cause painful pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and comic book imagery leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive governments at the ExCeL Centre in the London Shipyard area at the Defence and Security Equipment International.

With a separate campaign, many posters also appeared on bus stops and metro trains, which require more detailed familiarity.
"Important information, Do you travel on the DLR route from September 15 to 18?" together asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track turns into a picture of the tank.
This September, a pack of gun dealers will arrive on the DLR route... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Cruel Designs).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters across London using "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages, a six-pound pack of hex wrenches that, according to the collective, "get access to one-third of the advertising space for bus stops across the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this unauthorized "declaration vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside the galleries.
A lot of artists have started working with activists in resistance fronts when they have realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed over 100,000 times through Facebook in the last 24 hours, created free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and background commentator worked for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Leverin found that the weapons fair was not advertised at all - and there was also an empty spot on ExCeL's calendar at the time - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic commercial of obscure corporation, but "it was more stopping to emphasize the matter with bright colors and animation."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
Now the UK Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art related to the weapons fair comes from inside ExCeL as exhibitors peddle fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that he had received an order from the U.S. military for the "AT4CS RS that would be launched from the shoulder."
This includes "a unique pipe-puting warhead that targets excellent effects behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in a Student Dorm
It's been 11 years since, unaware of the age of 19, I moved to a student dormitory, and that's when I still believed in baretts and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the violent smiles of the people I provoked and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Much of what I learn can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dormitory can be anything that gets on the nerves to be completely scary.
It's tempting to babble: tell me where you're from, whether you liked the gap year, and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why "I don't really love or hate Marmite because really it's just yeast extract HAHAHA for me to find in my room".
Take a breath.
And help others take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the ones you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelashes are on fire and they shared fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie nights, and luxury places to spend time, but they are also the places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about starting college when you're in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories form a culture of wandering from room to room that is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say "I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now so I can gather back the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Knocking when there was a speech: knock.
A guy in my student dorm thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw quite a few things.
Friendship through baking.
Since you start a college in the peak season of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate pastry plate and introducing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Providing self-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to talk, and it may be that they will associate your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, this depends on whether you can bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar fat lumps are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking some chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk into your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission even if they boil internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to take it more adult than my dorm buddy who mixed detergent with his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You should not make noise so that people cannot sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that proverbial pot ringing a pot.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could play slower than their drum and bass music because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam this morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally quieted down at 5 a.m., the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making their own music roar, locked her doors, and went for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm with you?
Or in reverse, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of a dorm partner as your future spouse, teamed up, divorced, and then saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him.
Of course the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot dorm partner isn't really your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your lower end.
In the exhilarating moment you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between pranking and bullying is thinner than it seems.

Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation on Kitee - The planned house for reception centre was smeared in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the accommodation of foreign students on Saturday morning in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation, according to the Eastern Finnish police.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of youth social guarantee education at the Folk High School, an estimated ten people were in the building under vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the Folk High School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
Luukkainen says the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being the perpetrators and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident occurred last week.
This was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.
Focus 15 September at 16:02 Corrected by police for incorrect information about the age and status of the people who lived in the target building.
State shuts down Y train to Karjaa - passengers in their hands, "just idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news indignant passengers boarding the early evening shift of that train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing more than political will or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video from HSTV that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
H and R trains running on the main line are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services on during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and routes to be closed are available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the urban area by train.
"It's just bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said as he climbed the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach track, replacing the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. taking you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring more costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million a year for the Y train, of course, much more than this.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
In contrast, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made per year with discontinued services, compared to approximately nine million trips in total traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital Currentity: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crises in the global economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in Marx's Capital topicality, published today.
"He will now be taken more seriously than he has in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy more and more widely into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, prestigious financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
Is the former CEO of the Research Institute for Business and the Business Delegation not Marxist?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a topical economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual idea is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went hard wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early days of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are discussing Marx's interests again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful to Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Yet, in Korkman's opinion, Marx is worth getting to know.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the Civil War of 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
The rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed the murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
England's yo-test allowed social media to be weighed
The autumn matriculation examination included a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
England's skills were tested by more than 16,000 pledges.
The experiment could write the subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English 150-250 word article could be addressed to the administrator of the online magazine's counseling column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the subject, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates Mia Lybeck, lecturer in English at Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third topic was only a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire experiment as "quite normal."
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that were wearing, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, test will take place.
In high schools, the test is arranged normally, meaning that it is not affected by the protest of wage earners.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the pledges to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can attend the trial.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your negligence.
Oulu robbed of trade at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando beanie covering his face.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and had caught a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary data, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
Police officers at work, on the other hand, are not only responsible for alerting tasks and other police activities, but also for securing the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway square are closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 a.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west from Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that enough is enough.
I am not taking a stand on the police's industrial action issues.
According to Kujala, support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The exact number of patrols is not reported by the police.
"Somewhat is coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging you to avoid private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until early evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed in the Railway Square.
Buses are quite far away.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go calmly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the trade union movement by no means has the support of all wage earners for Friday's protests.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a 1993 Murrostorstai, Siisiäinen says.
Organized in the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Centre) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the time of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the toughest bourgeois government in Finland ever is in power now, Siisiinen says.
The current coalition government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time of the thunder, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
There are a wide range of them.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union protests have been quite peaceful - although the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric varnishes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Reconciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many who made the recession unemployed, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers climbed tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
They had last been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors Striked in 2001
"Doctors on strike - by necessity," was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation finds out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in resolving the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria on board a truck were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant operations, among other things, and its CEO is a man with foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
Captain beating up refugees, former drug courier and a deep-rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A deep-rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human trafficking into the European Union.
Member Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death's Travel Agency, written by them, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present suggestions for solutions, and introduce smugglers from different steps in the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them up right away.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer celebrations.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to Lampedusa Island, which is part of Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain in the chain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir will earn about 8,000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go out at midnight with passed-out lanterns.
The first night, we drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is going on a return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police once stunned him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from south of the Sahara.
They say he's got to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'll beat them up right away.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves in general and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which is now what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða area, a large hub for human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's rides are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly silly all the way.
First, for example, a price of 300 euros is agreed, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 200 kilometers, most of it comfortably on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers fleeing the Congo visit, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear peeks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, off-road car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will initially call one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money nicely, and collapsing among the peddlers who cross the border.
To obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones in northern Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It helps the Missionary's contacts with Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and moving the process to a European country, for example, 4,500-7,000 euros.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving a freeway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for arranging illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across the freeway to a rest place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it must be ensured that it is on its way to England and not Holland, for example - and cuts across the protective cover safety wire.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a fry or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police heat scanner from noticing the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene, hoping the driver won't rush the salaminators at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Uppoika, the Turk has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean invasions, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: a yacht is rented from Turkish ports to take American or European families on nice few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded into crowded Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of between €5,000 and €7,000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed into minibuses and driven somewhere on the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, the ship must be boarded quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about 53,000 euros for one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller makers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are held and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments through cover companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he appears to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next.
American Olympic runner tells of his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by 1,500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top from the very beginning and defended his leadership position in the manic race.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength ran out.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with foreign men.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he needed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was revealed in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1st in the world at 1500 metres at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
World champion rejoiced when union put Norwegian ski rooster in check: "Direct back"
Petter Northug, the Norwegian ski king, has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the athlete's contract all summer and autumn as last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
As a result of the contractual dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season on the national team so he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also take care of future generations, and would not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, affirming that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as then in the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in total, including two gold medals.
He was a member of a team that won message gold in Falun last winter.
Baking Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25 September, events will be held in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Baking Translators Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for leaving for the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, the aim is to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
The event has been decided to be made one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will take place on the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of Kauhava reception centre carried to the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, i.e. Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building entity would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held for the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Arto Rädy, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Board of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists at the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concern about managing the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we are facing major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tension over the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched on in discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closes for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to perform the operations of the airports during the work stoppage by the supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars around 9:30-14 a.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed towards Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police say the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told STT about it in the evening.
Most of the beginnings close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Posti's services.
Significant delays are expected for the distribution of day mail, among other things.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
Meal transports, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples, are also sought.
Situational information on services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Service Trade Union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 a.m.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to participate in a protest by trade unions.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open by supervisor if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Helsinki day care centres will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to a demonstration by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, a wide range of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often repeated the way the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
This channel is now being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio speech be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is now being talked about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television speech will not tell of a more general government turning inward.
Is the aim to take the right to define public debate more strictly into one's own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? ponders Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
Reminds me of the recent comment by Secretary of State (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues will not be related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not reporting issues in a democracy.
It is the job of the media representatives, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
According to Koivunen, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more available today that we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interests or general line.
A clever bet from the wing
In the forthcoming speech of Sipilä, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring his own view out without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a news conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech because more specific questions will not be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat is dripping, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do his thing well, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
He said that there has been no such thing in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Employees' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide endlessly," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
POIKA HAS FOUND AND WHEN, the boy's father updated to his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped with the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed with young people's violent fad: You'll cause anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish-based free fighter, posted a video on Facebook that appeals specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a weighty speech against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to view an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the fad of the young.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick those on the ground, sit on the other, and punch indiscriminately without thinking about any of these consequences that this will have when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people from native Finland.
It is precisely that you fight in general on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku-based Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a lot of these isolated cases.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a while.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get subjected to some racism, you're going to have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with one of those, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys are making me hate that I don't like myself.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you won't improve them at all," Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The staff centre organisation STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter with little words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, contracts made by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not good enough for SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: A big demonstration threatens to slumber - "It feels a little funny to wear a fist"
It feels a bit funny to wear a fist, if there is already a reconciliation paper in your pocket," writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary in the employee camp from side to side.
Is the government to be called down or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK federal leaders blew holy hatred of the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being caught.
The threat spread to the Akava people as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or daycare centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), the chairman of the staff member centre organisation STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his compromise paper is already complete.
At first, there was no yard from SAK's office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just Monday told him to put the country up on Friday.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for a joint proposal by employees to emerge, SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has relations with Sipilä's Board of Directors.
Jukka Ohanus, Director of Social Influence at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers of the Centre Party, Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described the government's trade union expertise as having improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit of a boost away from the Finnish stoppers, with Marko Piirainen (sd) from the ACP as their frontman.
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July jubilee meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting - a matter on which the President could remind journalists.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who is leading the meeting in Bator, Ulan, and who has already discussed with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock meets real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The killer and the lock continue bull days in Hakametsä today, as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no real paint parties in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to reverberate a 3-2-continuation victory over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
The Blues, which had started with a tangled catch, had round zero points as a guest, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti anticipates setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
The killer has just dropped from the Lock final series in the previous two seasons.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three alongside and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flute shift today.
With the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Perspective: A lousy play running in the Ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself starred.
The underdog sensationally struggled with heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The anonymous and wood-handed stew progressed to everyone's astonishment in the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Pori Matt and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver they won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season's novel works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for the Aces has built a potaka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in a trough like Rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copperinen are credited with something other than disc playing.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the lead role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Rock into Sean Connery.
Iron Rock is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock other than a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates hard play, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ässie's Garrett Stafford tackled Tappara from Jere Karelia to the head.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve to.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the ace puck, Iron Rock, which was hot, snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
The Aces' team this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, police officers, and healers.
There are practically no key men in the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited," Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smoldering under the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is equal to many losses in the goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays her husband for the first time.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanna, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
Sirkka cheers up and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, the easier it seems to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me for the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have converged a lot.
They've met, spoken on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of their history from different angles.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really dreary.
There was a rather low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been a little different at times.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola's infamous skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuuka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka in the last 10 years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 becomes the most expensive play film in Finland
The Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film ever with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is being done will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa will begin in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I am more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big stori.
However, 100 million could be stuffed into the film, because every angle of view and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that it's not loose at all.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trend setters' breasts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or T-shirt was seen as somewhat hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or tavisfashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes possible as if as a way to differentiate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, let's put on the net shirt already buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable stripe sweatpants, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear now flash the edge of the jeans are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
It is claimed that a special incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian State of Emergency Ministry had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in a pretty good mood and at least not based on those pictures, it's about any getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and roty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stuck have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the weapons show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a Bloknot.ru case in which Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch in an attempt and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he could not get out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

10 points about the effects of Friday stop on you - watch the video!
The trade union demonstration will be held at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm, but the strike will affect the lives of citizens for a much longer period of time - throughout the day and even beyond.
ISTV explained on 10 points how Friday stop affects citizens.
Watch the video to see the impact of work stoppages on road and rail transport - both in the transport of goods and passengers.
Air transport is a chapter of its own.
The strike action will badly overwhelm it, at least around noon, but the reflections will probably continue until Saturday.
What about schools and kindergartens?
Police and fire department?
Grocery stores, Alkot and mail flow, not to mention factories and ports?
There may be changes to the details of strike information before Friday.
The Ilta-Sanomat website will keep you informed.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called rich sand basin into a ditch.
The company said measures had been initiated to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as process water or passed through a surface drainage field into the environment as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company says the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool dam structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of sympathetic message to the government's actions in the IMF's assessment, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be overcut.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the financial messages.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In today's new business cycle forecast, Danske anticipates that growth will be on zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the latest findings as a basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
On the other hand, less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer meters.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that was raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to involve Nintendo heavily in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing each year.
Hundreds of minor applicants are missing each year, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, on their website SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will disappear "under land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland for minors who came alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were closed because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors who have come alone.
There are no total statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have made a conversion decision?
For example, do they also disappear into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates in the country.
He has taken action on this.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Conference, Orpo, who considered refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see photos of equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to illness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
The online advert was first reported by the online magazine Iltamacasini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move out of his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what stuff is being abandoned.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to expand the force action in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the Friday demonstration.
In the afternoon, it will be determined whether traffic will stop all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief shop steward, says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts badly sting drivers, so government plans to cut supplements raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that seizing traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport is virtually completely stagnant in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
No local or long-distance traffic will move on Friday.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning three to Saturday morning at three o'clock.
Probably a small number of buses can be run, they are run by supervisors," HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo says.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
The employee organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward with Europe, reports the AP.
Sky News reports that refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
Local media also said Hungarian police had used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thinks self-made bell was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought the self-made watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to showcase the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the clock looked like a bomb.
Police were called in, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to the youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said police had said the watch looked like a "film bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council wonders if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is buzzing - Labour leader refused to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour Party MPs.
This has offended the people," Labour MP Kate Green said in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect to pilots by attending the event.
We are all indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear him will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity measures and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear today for the first time as a party leader in parliament during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, financial security and the security of our families," the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing still unclear - the family father was facing a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
After first shooting a shotgun at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concern about the absence of children at the school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead all over the house.
StarTribune says it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Business
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors weekly.
I have made 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected in Short's family buying a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
StarTribune said the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's site had not removed any blasphemous comments from the prep courses, and thus had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner three were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great," Loiri commented cheerfully on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Success horse coach Korpi gets Loir involved in full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka determines and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The greatest athlete ever made a donation"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
The hospital reports that this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed a contract with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
Japanese cafe can be ordered for wife's evening - serves food with bikini and apron only
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug cafe and now a wife café on the market.
It strikes the lonely, the social and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
From the Ore no Yome café in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It is a waitress who pretends to be the customer's spouse.
"Half" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just up against the apron and bikini, while the husband is on tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates, always to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field," a statement released by Intel said.
The Board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report based on ASRB's research results in the future.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate is that 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," said Chris Young, Intel Security director.
ASRB allows Intel to establish safety best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected to rise like a moon for years.
Finally, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the car world is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine.
The price is also interesting for Finns, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Kia introduced two new features at Frankfurt Motor Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two innovations in Finland, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Director of Design, Sportage is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and exterior dimensions have become a centimeter here and there and the car is splitting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to coming to sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher standards of equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are added.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - blazing in a bold overall outfit
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pants suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully introduces the waist of the singer star's graceful.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during the three-year break, has lost her pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I have missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
Chisu will release his new and fourth album, Polaris, in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes again - now you can see the breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives one topic after another.
She readily presents her pregnancy stomach and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m. American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress when the flashlights flicker.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume, she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was highlighted by black overgenerational boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last Friday of the week, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
Manon Leloup, the top model, wanted to correct the notion that the model world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out of the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you have posed in top designers' outfits the previous season, the new season will start with castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one type of thinness.
Agent in New York may ask for pounds to drop, but in Paris, they'll say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time serve as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the difference is sad.
Models want to be in this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York City is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays the band's founding member Antti Lautala in the film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist who's almost 26 years old, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to make impressions of a person.
The man piloting Scrooge Salminen and Dogs does not go into the role.
Punk manneris come naturally with the man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many certainly saw a foretaste, as well as if they have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but always goes full-on.
The main actors in the film You Made Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is performed by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Previously seen in mustache and chin beard, Scrooge has shaved his face smooth-posque, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to reach Europe in recent days.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue to be raised, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Smaller children are worth protecting, and not, for example, letting them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
It is not worth scaring the child in vain, even if you are distressing and scaring yourself.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to bring it up with them if you are wondering about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how this is viewed in our family.
But do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place after all?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If you also talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
Ball flash that strikes the blood difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind Apila's Ball Lightning into a heavy blow in midsummer.
It only ran out of profits and second places until at the end of July, a collapse came in the Tampere ranks.
Since the stallion was thoroughly clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but required two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Ball Lightning had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Apila's Ball Lightning was very under pressure from the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Given those things, a small tendency at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
Coach assumes that a good competition made the stallion a blade.
The horse's tune certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would have leveled off as well.
Apila's Ball Lightning has been a so-called humor horse.
When you haven't amused it, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has been detached from the stallion by such lightning that opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, fellow competitors cannot cope with the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo, there is a nest run in the Nordic region's wishes.
The other thing is how Apila's Ball Lightning agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and might even be a bunch under the boom in the departure car and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.

Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, said Tim Cook, the company's CEO, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Magazine kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
Cook says Apple is investigating, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation waned to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate slightly downwards a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rates were 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than it was a year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus-marked according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Eurozone inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2% price increases in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
US Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more securely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, begins to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can push on top at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they used to - and if they react to the tightening of the Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not think they know when exactly the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may result.
It becomes clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand interest rates rising than at any time before since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year
Leaders who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in over nine years may come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage points interest rates ended, with which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversities in financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than at any time since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the transformations of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact are being reported since the 1950s.
It has been less than a year since the first rate increase began, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within one year and two of the start of the Fed interest rate increases.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately lowered its key interest rate by a dozen cycles of different lengths since the early 1950s.
Each time has differed in some respects from the others, and the narrator is relatively scarce in the review, so they hardly allow you to conclude anything certain about the effects of the next interest rates.
Strategies point out that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably discovered even by decades of research.
But three points about the reasons that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low in the 21st century for too long.
They patched up the marks of a techno bubble, and at the same time grew the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and already too high increased even greater by the influence of central banks' excess monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history to date was born.
3) In particular, mad debt financing, which was packed in the financial economy with near restraint, inflated most aspects of financial markets the largest exchange bubbles in economic history up to that point, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor does it create a very harsh dispute that the financial markets that rose to heights on increasingly complex leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state as the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures set on debt leverage, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted only their time after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned to an increase.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give a point of thought by mentioning such things as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now the debt burden is heavily heavier in different parts of the economy than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has left central banks more transparent and cheaper than before has mostly remained in the financial markets and has subsided the key classes of securities and assets to the most expensive level since the peak before the financial crisis or ever.
And strategists not only flatten the atmosphere with warning signs from financial markets, but also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession to the model that has occurred in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed next begins to tighten its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe Generalen strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it can seem.
He has been preparing the bank's international investor customers for the following translations of the Fed for a long time:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to shut down financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's corporate service side, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focusing on corporate sales, and HP Inc., a company focusing on consumer PCs and printers, in November.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers account for more than 10% of its operating profit.
The other year, its three most significant customers brought 65% of operating profit.
iOS 9: How to Get a New Operating System on iPhone After Apple Update Release
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems since this installation, when a "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone guides the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process with a new tool that suggests uninstallable applications and then reinstalling them when the update is completed.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade so that the battery does not run out.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery runs out, it can lead to the update breaking.

It is also worth making sure you have gone through our list of all the things that need to be done before the download so that things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself from it if they go anyway. iOS 9 brings with it new features such as a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements that speed up and repair the operating system.
Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings pass through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own job was to ensure that the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the proceeds of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take on the first 100 residents as early as 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is especially the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening of working life.
The organization also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization's administration meeting during a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has a terrible enthusiasm for having a conversation if you have one to 100 on the side.
Palola: Negotiation link has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication to Parliament about its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists and has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the surgery of Sunday supplements is a painful place for the staff centre organisation STTK field in particular.
The organization requires the government to back down from the coercive legislation it would implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP that has kept the issue on the agenda.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the pay for the first sick days is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
STTK stresses that central organizations have invited wage earners to the demonstration, and it has not been intended to organize the strike.
Akava Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder thanks STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming along the same lines as Akava, as Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working hours banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitiveness leap sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will be available to the government and employers of the country," Fjäder says.
Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, jolts" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
The bingo coupon of the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a television speech.
Single call, monarchist spirit
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a prime minister's announcement, allowing the speech to be discussed as well."
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "exclusive call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist vibe: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it."
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
Tried is.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered this and found that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
Like us in the time of the Tammelas
The speech has also sparked mockery.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on the prettier den and Dad matches the tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be quieting down to the TV like we used to be in the time of Me Tammelas," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted the following bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to power Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan for Assad to give way to power in style after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal because it believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a one-on-one debate: the opposition was not to be armed, there was to be a speech connection between the opposition and Assad immediately, and the abdication of Assad had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he conveyed Thurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Thurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused all agreements with which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has officially supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Thurkin spoke under Moscow authorization.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power on some al-Assad supporter.
The refugee stream of our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we caused ourselves," Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers' Settlement Centre in Tornio
The Government's asylum seekers' organizing centre, designed in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in a building in Tornio's joint session empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
You could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted to quickly.
The joint session would accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of part of the government's search for the price of labour.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for compensatory means for the work-life extortion reported by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a resort, as it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the planned cut in Sunday supplements by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday money, as they are recorded in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will be reporting to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
The final deadline is not either.
Legislative work then starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting harder and harder.
It's a good time.
It won't be long in such things, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, converting Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the pay for the first sick days is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as coercive legislation past trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Due to the actions, the Centre of Employees organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of Mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but slightly approved the extension of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahalli warehouse.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200,000, but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
The Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous sharp position on bringing Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of nurturing the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the area.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use in Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing, with good consideration on a case-by-case basis.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth being open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of them can be used well to benefit from the diverse marketing of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether there is any way to live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, the continuation of which has also been in the report on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
The effects of the closures of these transport connections should be considered, for example, for employment, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10-20% are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one gravel sound for the Seu War
The Joensuu City Board's view of the regional Sion war project is seemingly unanimous, but there is one gravel sound among them.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured), a member of the City Board, proposed to abandon the entire project at the Board meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the closing proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of train services.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train services is left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money for train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will come into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed off the roof and could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornio hill, Ketotie, at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That didn't stop the crowd of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of amateur radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue services to help the last one on the roof safely return to the surface.
FedEx's operating profit dual, lowers tax year 2016 outlook
FedEx reported depressing results in the latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its full-year profit forecast, due to the weakened demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening clock.
FedEx Corp. says it expects next May to end with a tax year result of $10.40-10.90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The smaller outlook came despite an average price increase of 4.9%, which will take effect on January 4, and despite the higher surcharges that began in November for land transport of heavy or large parcels.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year because they have cut costs, revenue has increased and e-commerce is on the rise.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performs steadily, taking into account weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
Plans for salaries for the duration of the holiday were announced the day after rival UPS reported that he plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same amount as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
The profit per stock came at $2.42, which is left with an average forecast of $2.44. The survey of 12 analysts was conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In a Zacks poll, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered a decline in international priority transportation in recent years, which has halted the development of its Express unit's revenue.
However, the rise in e-commerce has improved FedEx Ground results.
In the last quarter, the country unit's turnover rose by 29 per cent, but the revenue from the operations was basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and its own insurance.
Express unit revenue was better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations was reduced by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
FedEx closed an 11% drop for this year on Tuesday and a 17% drop below the June 11 record.
The decision-makers of the Federal Reserve are sitting around a huge mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether the time has come to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural from the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank president Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
Congress has put two kinds of responsibility on the central bank: they need to maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable.
However, since the Great Depression, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.The decision on whether the US economy is ready for rehab on a record incentive brought by the short-term interest rate level that has remained almost zero until late 2008 .
While most data shows a steady growth in the economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets may have made central bank officials already on guard in advance even more frightened when it comes to increasing instability. Fear of how it would affect if the federal funds rate reference value were increased by even a quarter of a percentage point.
"Understandably, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at the brokerage movement Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if they are looking for justification for the restoration of interest rates, increased uncertainty in the global market is a valid enough reason to wait yet," he says.
There is no agreement on the decision of the central bank, which also creates nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of financial experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Financial markets, on the other hand, expect the central bank to delay the withdrawal, as the key indicator shows that the chance of growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the decline in securities markets if the central bank raises the level unless the decision-makers then manage to soften the impact by promising that the next withdrawal will not occur anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery was brought with the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, chief economic expert at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest rates right now," he says.
If decision-makers raise interest rates, "they need to put a lot of effort into their policy to support the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argue that an elevated level would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards slow tightening the monetary situation, which would verify the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has stated in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite liberals demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest figure in seven years and close to the level the central bank considers to be the limit for full employment.
Wage growth has shown signs of pick-up.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's 2% annual target, central bank decision-makers say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the price of significantly lowered oil.
The economy "survives and also needs higher interest rates given the tight situation in the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, Chief Financial Specialist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by up to 16% from its May record when investors feared China would slow down the economy as well to slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now nearly 10% below the peak in May.
For central bank decision-makers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells us when interest rates should be raised.
"Without these financial market events and news coverage of the weakness of China's economy in recent weeks, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that decision makers will wait at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still quite unclear and they have little information at their disposal when it comes to the consequences of what happened in China," Oliner says.
The welfare of the international economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the monetary authority of the world.
In recent years, the central bank has had enormous influence.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanken, hinted that the central bank could "encourage" the increase in money caused upheavals in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interwoven, central bank officials are expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science," says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of asset management company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, this month pointed out that "the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that have appeared to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes decisions, has called for an increase in interest, and Lacker, a member entitled to vote for the Committee, relies on the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on U.S. economic growth," Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank overturned these cuts.
The central bank should only put economic stability first during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil does not come anywhere near its level, Posen says.
"No one wants to be in a situation where there is a fear of raising interest rates because the market is upset," says Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability; as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazilian Pediatric Association in Rio Grande advertises healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association for Pediatrics SPRS has found a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts with descriptions of unhealthy food painted on them.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven channel Sunrise program is a favorite in viewer numbers, despite Nine channel's attempts to report on leadership revelation on Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to report on the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader's revelation failed to increase Today's ratings.
Nine's morning show was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull deposed Tony Abbott.
The rival program Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long series of international broadcasts, which also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The ballast of the distance did not seem to bother Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise's average viewership was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared to 339,000 Today's.
Today's average rose slightly compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been catching Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varied between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
So far, during September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change this morning are blowing away from Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news on Seven was the 800 Words series, featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which garnered a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered if Thomson is the driving force behind the popular series alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave him real certainty.
Seven's The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1.136 million viewers, easily winning The Block series (838,000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
Seven had a dual fate the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new quiz show hosted by Andrew O'Keefe attracted an average of 446,000 spectators.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 spectators - which was a small enough win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half-hour viewer averaged 520,000 spectators, and the second half-hour figure was a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewer average decline brings Nine channel confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce the number of viewers on McGuire's program.

The final trio agree with Daddy that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who would win The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman that Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been kept extremely secret.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we talked to Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they could inadvertently give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women became poetic when they told how Wood is the perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family rank, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers could provide a revelation of who won the bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been uncomplicated since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, the energies of (Sarah) and Sam felt quite compatible, and that idea was on my mind throughout the series," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really down to earth, it's fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to have a nice and relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would fit well.
Mackay said last week's home visit meetings made him realize that Wood could be "the one."
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now wholeheartedly involved in this," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was enigmatic.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the remaining girls as much, so it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open practice day since the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne in the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league convert dropped the ball in his first flight kick return when the team won the Minnesota 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and let Hayne return the next flight kick and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true nature was also reflected in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new entrants a pataluha in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a post-game press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight kick that the Minnesota Vikings captured in the first quarter of the game
This was certainly not the beginning Hayne and her numerous Australian fans hoped for a man for an NFL debut.
Haynen was seen swearing on the way from the field after the drop, and later told Australian radio pair Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM at 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his groping to his 2007 Origin debut when feeding in his own target area led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account in a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint, threatening a Siberian runway.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4 killed while police fired rubber bullets against protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd that protested against the country's new draft constitution, the official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of an ethnic group called Madhesi say that the new provinces established under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have died in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted on the clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and authorities have said that the new charter can be adopted by Sunday.
US National Hurricane Center NHC says there is a 60% chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
The wide low-pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verdean group of islands, has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
The second observant low-pressure front, located halfway between the Cape Verde Island Group and the Small Antilles, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecast center added.
Google to launch donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) released a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal perspective when it published a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being a leader, Google employee Rita Masoud wrote about her own personal experience, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has increased, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations are received by four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will respond with the same amount to every donation made worldwide on google.com/refugelief up to $5.5 million, with a total target of $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly due to Syria's four-year civil war, which has driven over 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many also flee war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to a new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese type 2 diabetics can last at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those treated in ways other than surgery.
"It takes a long time to get mortality data," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery magazine.
In weight loss or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but the majority of people in the study have been morbidly obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, or weight ratio to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is above 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if a person's BMI is above 30, they are considered to be obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, with medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut persons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same in 29 people treated with other means than surgery.
36% of people who were cut had a total and 28% had a partial improvement in diabetes.
By comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgery group," the authors noted.
The researchers also followed the patients' blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in the long run.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
Postoperative haemoglobin A1c levels dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control", described by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over a five-year period, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The team also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the fifth year, when compared to the gastric reduction surgery group, the group that had undergone gastric bypass surgery had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), decreased their body mass index more (7.4 and 5.1), decreased haemoglobin A1c levels more (3.1% and 2.1%), and was more likely to have achieved complete diabetes remission (46.9 percent and 16.7%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while research does not show survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives in heavier people.
A Swedish study found that obese people who had undergone weight loss surgery had a 29 percent lower chance of dying over a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not show an improvement in the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says the results are nevertheless encouraging for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the study are crucial precisely in showing that surgery is safe for the lower body mass index group," and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the point when the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to ethics research.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also inadequate.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you are forced to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The ultimate thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States caused a chain of violent events.
"After the 9/11 attack, I expressed my condolences to President Bush in the letter and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Over the past four years, ingestion of children's hand disinfection agent has increased fourfold
Poisoning data centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400% increase in the ingestion of an alcoholic hand disinfection agent for children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Georgian Poison Information Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poison Information Center, cases of disinfectant ingestion reported to poison control centers for children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 cases in the 2014 16117 case.
"Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them are on call," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge on social media.
YouTube has videos of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get cheap ascent hum.
Reports indicate that teens have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Pleasant fragrances of disinfectant can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hands) are the ones with the added fragrance.
There are strawberry, grape and orange-scented disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95%.
Especially in young children, only a few squirts are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," Mr. Stephen Thornton, director of medical care at the University of Kansas Hospital Poison Information Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So don't leave the whiskey shot lying on the table, but the hand disinfection agent is left visible, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four squirts of strawberry-scented hand disinfectant at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, twice the limit of adult drunk driving, says Chris Ritchey, a first aid clinic doctor who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah moss when he spoke and was unable to walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain injury symptoms, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
It could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfection wipes and move the disinfectant out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a hand disinfectant containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison into the classroom, a police report reports.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
Police consider the plan to be a "flexible nonsense" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor Mill: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths belittles talks about Celtic contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but he makes it turn
Hearts fights Scottish Football Association over Neilson's charges, and Warburton is wary of January's recruitments that could disrupt team unity
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference to Celtic to five points.
Griffiths downplays talks about conflicts
Rumors have arisen about Celtic's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more close scrutiny as the team is preparing to face the Dutch serial leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
Lack of Scots Championship bores Dutchmen - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition for the championship with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador, de Boer, said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the games of these teams, and non-Scotlantic people also want to follow those games.
Deila vows to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the situation around.
Losing Malmö and the resulting fall from the Champions League quickly resulted in a loss for Aberdeen, who played with ten men, who is now at the top of the series with a five-point difference to the next.
However, Deila said, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we're getting up again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves players' performance.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton on guard from January player transfers
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible targets for January player moves, he is wary of the recruitment frenzy, affirming that he does not want to confuse the group with the consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in the summer, the time of adjustment is the entire period before, which is reflected in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more trouble.
Celtic interest Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is associated with Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has hinted that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old player has had ankle problems for two years and failed to find new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight Scottish Football Association over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked, and this was already the third red card convicted by Collum in the past eight months, which was revoked.
Neilson remains behind what he said, claiming, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded for singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was derby and it was a whim for a while," the attacker said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I move on to playing Celtic."
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the management team's ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the players' weakening must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes delighted with "ugly win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, hung desperately in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to achieve their seventh consecutive league win thanks to Adam Rooney's first half penalty kick, which put them at the top of the table five points above Celtic.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it be a trophy or a league that has not also won games this way."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the UK's total number increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistical Office (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of people in employment is now 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74% over the quarter, which is higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The government's long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Prove Execution in Oklahoma
If no legal intervention occurs, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' gallery at Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison watching Richard Glossip be executed with a lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received the request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started to dread this day as it approaches.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists have the opportunity to follow executions in America, and since there are often more applications than available places, participants are selected through a terrible draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the seats reserved for the media from twelve to five.
Whoever is chosen looks at the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also made my own connection to him through months of calls and one two- and a half-hour visit.
I like a man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I've seen.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising on my neutrality.
Here's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants you to, and you'll be able to participate.
I complained to the reporter.
He admitted that "he could have set his words better", but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he said so.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants to have an international journalist present to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is by my side.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I made in the series.
I will not go through all the details again here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I think there's a very strong chance that he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective I think he's going to die from.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I like die unnecessarily.
Man lured out of Canning River after watery police hunt
Canning Vale's officer remained dry as he lured the man out of the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to distract the police from his heels went wrong when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just meters from a police officer who tried to "attract him gently back to the beach."
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to distract them by heading to the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water saying 'I'm not coming away, come get me'," said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic: "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people do funny things trying to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed to do so in his attempt, but inspired locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatens to stop competing
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria officials tried to infiltrate their furrows into his stables last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He accuses the officials and Racing Victoria's integrity division, claiming they have a personal campaign going on against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection of the treatment measure on the day of the race was the last staple.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what was best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar's unexplained positive cobalt sample.
He has kept his tongue in check for spy claims for a year and a half, and did not want "it to look like envy."
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything erupts at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home today and I'm sleeping well.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I should not continue as a coach.
Then I would have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he reported that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I name him when asked - and offered him a job at my stables if he passed on information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should fire their lawyer, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of the matter at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps shift responsibility to more than just coaches for what is happening in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I that harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I'm saying now may make them think about that.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that grieves me.
It really saddens me.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
Coach frustration has increased with long-term Lidar cobalt research, and late rejection led him to state that he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for training undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the rule of race day care procedures "ridiculous" after the mud or clay bath is placed on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put mud on its leg.
It could have had a poultice last night.
It could have had it yesterday, as it was.
It had it on race day.
Moody may face a three-month ban on competition due to the pike treatment of the race day, from which the officials began the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Driver arrested in Cobram
Police have arrested a man who committed a traffic jam after colliding with a cyclist this weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when the car crashed into him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to police himself in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, neglect of assistance, and other traffic violations.
A cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks rivals in wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized two NRL-rugby league champion favorite claims that his team's tackles are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm to "pain" on their own side when it unexpectedly won the final qualifying in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final run. Bennett called the game the rugby league's "sample window" and said the two Queensland teams were not "very enthusiastic" about wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they just focus on "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that her confidence was enhanced by two leading coaches' criticism of Storm, as that means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when we lost 24-2 to them," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques throughout the year, and in the last six weeks we have only stressed contact with tackles, and that has made us successful.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this always comes up at this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "boringly".
Wayne talks about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players of that type.
He brought that side up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play rugby from his style - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like this because they're a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as a resistance to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more score-rich than the game between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense and not score?
For me, this is about policies.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is off this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night's pre-finals at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man threatened with a potential life sentence for a 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maximovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police tracked 100 pounds of drug to the Solay hunt that came to South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants at the marina throughout the morning, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 pounds of drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maximovic is threatened with a potential life sentence for a business-related cocaine holding attempt, his lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic was trying to hold the entire amount and that he could be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has close links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the Criminal Court case, Maximovic lied to the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail to ensure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that setting a $200,000 bail is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But it was not enough alone to stop him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maximovic was granted guarantees on condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police daily, and maintains his curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received numerous immoral photos of the children that another user sent her.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother.
When police came, they saw five photos, searched the computers on the scene, and found "careful" web searches with keywords used to search for immoral images taken of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before he "showed himself to be a police officer to scare them."
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundeen Sheriff Court the following: "He said it was an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the searches on the computer but said they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent him the photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for bait.
He said that after drinking, he's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "When she found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, shook and cried.
My mother saw the immoral pictures on the phone and then met the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to prosecuting the manufacture or taking of images of immoral children on June 14 last year. He broke bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear before the court on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be entered in the sex offenders' register, as it can be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence until October so that social services have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is in custody before the hearing.
He was added to the sex offenders' register before the date of the conviction.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech to parliament
Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by the opposition legislators' claims that they had been sent anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed and interrupted him with interludes as he gave a state of the country speech to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members involved that immunity would end in Parliament and when they step out, parliamentary immunity is not valid.
The group discipline supervisor said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and expense cutting efforts in the corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer business from faster growing business hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in expenses, starting with the fourth quarter," HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring efforts will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP president and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than modern-day HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services to help businesses move into a new kind of business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual turnover of over $50 billion, and will "focus on producing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" for companies," the company said in a statement.
The division breaks down a company founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a graduate of Stanford University, to manufacture electrical supplies. The company operated in a garage in Palo Alto called the "Study Place of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a huge restructuring to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its division is the latest in the industry, based on the belief that strictly limited companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb draws
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September and assuming that his rehabilitation will go as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of the next English games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity for this latest problem is that Wilshere's end of last season was strong after a single ankle injury, and he recalled his old sharpness before the season began.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when a player tries to return in the middle of the season, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, he has played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's larger entity since the 2007-08 season, in six of the eight seasons it has been one of the Premier League teams that has lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes their improvement in injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you recover from an injury can be a prone season when you have to strengthen your body and get competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and that he can make the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts their Champions League game Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on the start.
Wenger can also replace Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to maintain balance and give a respite to the players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up favorite of Block F, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday night, which was 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the lessons of last season's Champions League surrendering against Monaco, and is motivated by an increasingly distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup win.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men
It is striking how similar the descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and is three times more common in men than women.
The company tackles the problem Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced the 2015 Men's Year. The goal was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they needed it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed depressive symptoms. The study found that a person's ability to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of potential mental health problems occurring was halved if they had mentally healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
In this time of communication through social media, the style goes past the content and the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, joyful and successful, when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is at the expense of inner values - the personal growth and friendship of inner longing - that more deeply affect our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get greater happiness.
The greatness of the Friends was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in nice chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all this, although they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..."when listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I have really understood how even the slightest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Often, men who contact us feel that they cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up from problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my unbiased, outside position at the other end of the phone helps people with moments of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the locations are redesigned to celebrate the celebration, why don't you take your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone lonely in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends are broadcast at Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG slap Malmö aside
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan celebrate goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is a match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right track when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his Champions League game with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in her Champions League debut for less than four minutes, pointing the way for the French league champions, but the team missed several chances before finally increasing their head start when Cavan scored in the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same A-block as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetski, needed a strong start against the Swedish league champion, as there was not only a follow-up position in the game, but also an improvement in their games leading to the quarter finals in the last three rounds
But even though PSG took the score, it wasn't a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Laurent Blanc's team lost the spot in front of the goal and was later changed from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the statistics, and it's a good start, even though there are things we're going to have to hone this season," Blanc said.
This anticipates good.
We wanted to win and we won, even though I regret that we failed to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisian team after injury for one of three changes made after the team remained in the 2-2 draw against Bordeaux in Ligue 1's home game this weekend, but he was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine winger was named the man who takes PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran the Marco Verratt pass shut behind Malmö's defensive line and then struck a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the network.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, they were disappointed.
Malmö was a stuffy opponent. It won Celtic in a solution match when it reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and a five-man defense and two players in the deep midfield.
But the team offered little more on the offensive side than Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went past the nip button from Kevin Trapp's goal post.
Instead, PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost pitches and poor finishing, especially by Ibrahimovic, who failed in five attempts in the first half alone and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in from Ibrahimovic's touch at the beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing pre-work for his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pitch that Di Maria sent out a spiral kick that tilted around Wiland's paint post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play thanks to the Uruguayan Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had snapped forward from the left of Maxwell's cross pass.
That was the end of Malmö's hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant rejection of David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before the Ezequiel Lavezzi goal from the exchange was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
I'm gonna put on a hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
The mining industry in Switzerland was left by Glencore, which suffered a price collapse of commodities, raising $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities as the slowdown in the Chinese economy puts a strain on demand and is wreaking havoc in all markets.
The new entry raised the value of Glencore shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning trades.
Shares rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened at 0.69% higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion stock deal the previous week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt burden by about a third.
The company sold the new share capital for 125 pence of the share, which meant a 2.4% discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, worth a total of 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about the long-standing decline in Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20-40%.
White House confirms visit by Xi Jinping to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, a White House statement released Tuesday confirmed.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November," the statement said.
The President of the United States and the President's spouse Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by President Xi will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while at the same time allowing President Obama and President X to discuss constructively issues with disagreements," the statement added.
During a visit, first announced in February, Xi is also expected to deviate in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet numerous U.S. technology leaders before continuing towards New York City and the UN September General Assembly.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss numerous controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased absoluteness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays difference in filmmaking
Matt Damon clashed with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed the difference that Damon said was not needed behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, an experienced actor interrupted Brown as he emphasized the need for different perspectives on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"When we talk about difference, it's taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series," Damon claimed.
Shocked Brown reacted in disbelief to the injured, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay", while The Martian's actor's comments were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists of the series.
"I want to urge people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore his white pimp hits.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon harshly replied that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want."
After the conversation was broadcast, social media exploded to disapprove of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film clip, writing, "Matt Damon speaking on the only black person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHITE that it hurts."
After its release, the tweet garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when an accurate racial performance in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After white police killed teenage Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide and urged legislators and authorities to end practices that discriminate against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when she presented the Album of the Year nominees for the Grammy Award.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement to answer Fox News television face Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who have been invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Warrior Champion crowned
Professional rocker and dish collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and receive a $1 million grand prize.
It is in the competition program that ended its seventh season that there has never been a competitor who has survived all the sections of the program's obstacle track.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
In the last mission, you had to climb a rope about 23 metres in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and cleared the challenge in time, making him the first athlete ever to figure out the exhausting 4th leg of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after a difficult win and was still in shock for winning the $1 million grand prize.
"So it's great to think about this when I've never made or lived more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden...I can't even imagine what this is going to be...the future is unknown.
Production director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the final with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten doesn't get more reward money, even though he is the first competitor ever to have managed to pass the track.
The rules say money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes lives, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why he feels resentment.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Warrior returns to season eight, with filming starting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The other half of the season has not been very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers played their role as a prankster perfectly on Tuesday when it won the Minnesota Twins on the 5-4 Target Field.
The Twins missed the chance to get up half the end of the game from the Houston Astros in a race for another American League wild card slot.
For Detroit, the game was a return to the six-letter H-word for at least one night, which had been very difficult to reach most of the latter half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they are made," said Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early attack support when Detroit ran three times in the first two innings, and then once again in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 in 1/3 innings and let three runs.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong ending for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a changer to pitch in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers substitute Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first run since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since he hit Seattle Mariners four times on July 6.
"He waved the bat well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting exercises), looked much better in batting exercises and continued the same model in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh innings, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Sentteri Byron Buxton started inning by hitting out twice to the left field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, settled in one nest with a snap, and Simon was able to burn directly to second base player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player who stood against him, Miguel Sano, a substitute who would run two nests left of the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a leveling runner on second base, VerHagen got a third base Trevor Plouffe to hit the ground stroke leading to the double game.
This was the record for the main series: the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit the double game.
After Detroit had a confirmation run at the ninth start, Mauer raced two beaten runs against Tigers' shutter Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned Sano in three passes in his fifth rescue.
Detroit initially took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was rusty.
The Tigers received three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran player who got off the list of injured before the game after more than a month of lower back inflammation.
"It's obvious I didn't want this kind of start," Hughes said, "but as the game progressed, I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I was able to do a few nice passes in the third inning."
After Hughes caught the starter on the first base, he let second base player Ian Kinsler advance one way.
The walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side in a two-burn situation brought Victor Martinez to the batting, who took himself to first base in midfield and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tubes with runners in good running positions.
Third base player Nick Castellanos continued by hitting right and causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was abandoned in his attempt to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued in the second innings and received one fire, in two nests, a run from catcher James McCann and two fires, in one nest situation, a run from center Anthony Gose, after which the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot," Twins team leader Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right spot.
Hughes began to be in the pitch and pitched the running-free third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runs for six strokes and a walk for four fires.
NOTES: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was thrown away by a sprain on the shoulder of the throwing hand.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, but he was scheduled to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris' statistics on Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was exchanged for him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 due to a strain of the right slanted abdominal muscle.
The Tigers and Twins three-game series ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota's right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges to open the economy to the wider world
The economy must open up more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to deepening the general reform.
Supporting transparency while driving reforms forward with more new movement and vitality, and creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management team adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a relaxation of border control principles, an invitation by state-owned companies to seize private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be created to identify the sectors and companies that are not allowed to invest in.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government also loosens its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how to manage their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border models of economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
To open up state-controlled sectors to private financiers, more sectors open up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the application process for permanent resident permits for foreigners, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and easing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the professional rights of lawyers and supporting professional judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, also attended the meeting, said in a statement released after the meeting.
