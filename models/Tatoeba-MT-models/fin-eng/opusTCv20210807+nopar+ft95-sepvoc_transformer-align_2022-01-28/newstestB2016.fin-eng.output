9-year-old boy on the run in Tampere found
Police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape in Tampere on Tuesday evening.
The missing persons report for a boy who has left Western Tampere with a friend has spread on social media.
According to the Police Situation Center, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk of life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanomat at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're starting the post-clearance.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the home, the father said.
Ronaldo again wildly tore the goal difference to Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish League this weekend and continued his manufacturing in the Champions League as well.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League goal kingship turned for at least a moment in favor of the latter.
Ronaldo of Real Madrid moved alone to the top of the all-time scorer statistics when he shot a visitor into Shahtar Donetski's network with two hits from the penalty kicks and one from the game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal balance to 80 when Barcelona Messi, who was even-reading with him before Tuesday, has 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has stumbled in the Italian football league Serie A in the early season, but in Champions League D Group it started with a strong 2-1 guest win from Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored more than ten minutes before the end by Juventus Alvaro Morata.
City's attack was bored by the absence of the knee-sneed Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend Premier League game, did not arrive on the field until the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second club, United, also experienced a hard one in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old winger Luke Shaw's away match only lasted 15 minutes.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide tackle hit the goal towards the attacked ManU kit so badly that Shaw likely broke a tibia.
Shaw lay on the grass of Eindhoven's home stadium a dozen minutes before medical personnel went to transport him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno leveled before the break with extra time.
PSV's winning goal was scored in the second half by Luciano Narsingh.
The season of the goal-making in the Champions League was started by Group A Paris Saint-Germain.
This was the Argentine Angel Di Maria who changed Manchester United's shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball to the back corner past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made 2-0 for the second half PSG.
PSG has been ranked among the winners of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, one of the small clubs in the league, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star attacker Zlatan Ibrahimovic first faced his professional career departure club Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow's TsSKA lost B-block in a match to Wolfsburg 0-1 in Germany.
Opposition party immediately called for resignation - president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has given the same speech again in the country's parliament that he gave at the end of last month.
Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, 91, is in full breath.
The MDC, the main opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that confusion had occurred solely in Mugabe's staff and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt earlier and now with China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want extraordinary summit on refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders next week due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council leading the summits, will evaluate the request.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
Negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are part of the Home Affairs Ministers' table, according to Merkel.
Professor admits in emergency call that he shot his girlfriend
University professor Shannon Lamb asked for a voice in an emergency call, shaking the police into his home and said he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb specifically mentioned that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family would be on the woman's phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten message on white document paper: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the letter Lamb signed read, according to the authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to the school campus. Police found Ethan Schmidt, a history professor who was considered dead at the door of his study, who was believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police at Delta State University, stated that the university's authorities were informed of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made a fatal emergency call some time after this.
There was one more death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The day after the shootings, students and teaching staff stayed behind the locked doors, and authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers looked at the details in both locations, and the teachers who knew Lamb told them about the man, and researchers were born with a picture of a talented but perhaps troubled teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's classes.
According to Gautier Police at the Prentiss estate, the professor had no previous background in violence or crime.
Schmidt, in turn, had mentioned Lamb in a book that had recognized the "wonderful people" with whom he was allowed to lead academic lives.
Both worked at the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching staff consisted of 17 people. Many of the students attended courses for both men.
However, references to the problems emerged.
Brandon Beavers, a student who praised Lamb, reported that the professor seemed agitated and nervous "like he had something wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him at the end of the 2014-2015 academic year that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University due to some health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that the dissertation Lamb had worked hard for would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University principal William LaForge said he was unaware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, police determined what route Lamb had taken from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before reaching Lamb, police had taken their own lives with a 38-caliber pistol in the back of the house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his parents' home, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson reported.
Lamb's car was still running on the driveway.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had gone to this house, but Johnson said he believed the man knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began working as a geography and education teacher at a university with 3,500 students. The city had 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 .
He received a doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's longest-serving friends described this as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she met Lamb through mutual friends when she was 15 and Lamb was 20.
He and his friends were still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston guitar.
"Lamb was quite a heartbreaker at the time.
All the girls were on their medicine for him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been seeing each other for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but no document says they've been married.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river delta in Gautier's small town.
Police said the dog was fine.
Shawn O'Steen, a former Prentiss husband, said he divorced Prentiss 15 years ago, and the couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was absolutely shocked," O'Steen said of his daughter.
"Daughter and mother were best friends."
O'Steen had not met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both performed at the summer event three years ago.
Later, they also played together at times.
According to O'Steen, his daughter composes and performs her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautier, said he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on September 5 after Lamb played guitar and harmonica for a few audiences.
There was no indication that something was wrong.
"A happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We joked together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his organ, directed first-year seminars and specialized in Indian and colonial history," said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own fraternity and student union.
At Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a memorial service at candlelight, including teaching staff, other staff, students, and residents of the area.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a nighttime event where the university choir performed the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis situation is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant Journalists: Associated Press editors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, as police are now reporting that Lamb made an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was specified that although Lamb referred to Prentis as his wife in the emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us is not going to hire as many seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products says that it offers its current employees and seasonal workers the opportunity for additional hours of work.
The company plans to hire 40,000 people to stores and distribution centers across the country, hiring 45,000 seasonal workers in 2014.
Most jobs are part-time.
Interviews with applicants will begin this month, and new employees will start in October-December.
Although there are still months until the holiday season, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workforce for stores, as well as for the shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The premiere also had personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive. I noticed there was an empty place next to me. It dawned on me that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox said in a trailer for the upcoming Back in Time documentary.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time documentary is related to Back to the Future films, and the documentary interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg, in addition to Fox.
The film Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely an all-time time travel movie for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be released in VOD and DVD format and will be shown in selected cinemas from October onwards.
UN Secretary-General: No military solution in Syria
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's intensified military action and notes that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced his intention to meet with five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would take place later this month in connection with the UN General Assembly Ministerial Week.
Ban regretted that the dispersal of the Security Council, the Syrian people and regional powers has caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on the five permanent member states to show similar solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, which reached the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Chapters on Support Surveys: Is Donald Trump Seriously?
Trump has been labeled a idler.
He has also been considered a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
In Republican circles, every effort has been made to pull Trump down from the poll leadership.
Ten of the eleven national polls show Donald Trump double-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it practically says about the candidacy of the real estate mogul.
The elections are only in the early stages.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be nominated for the Republican.
Experts point out that Rick Perry, who was in polls at this time in 2011, was allowed to give room to the rising Herman Cain, and neither of whom eventually won a candidate election in any state.
Trump would have a difficult time in the general election for many reasons.
External factions such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth have noted Trump's strong position and have begun digging into the pit to overthrow him.
The following recent poll data indicate that the property mogul cannot be ignored by a shrug:
There has been a turnaround in Trump's support.
Just before Trump announced that he would run in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University poll, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
In early August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also hold in states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinnipiac gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republicans would be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In the CNN and ORC polls last week, 67 percent of Republicans found themselves very pleased or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be very unhappy with Trump's candidacy.
Ben Carson is almost as enthusiastically received as Trump (43% would be very satisfied with Carson's candidacy and 40% with Trump's candidacy).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
Third is Marco Rubio, who has a 21% equivalent support rate.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected party candidate.
Most Republicans do not find Trump's temperament problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his pomp and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the property mogul appropriate for the president. Views are evident from an opinion poll by ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same figure applies to Iowa, where the party convention is the first to take place: according to the Quinnipiac Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities appropriate for the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
However, according to ABC and the Post poll, 44 percent believe Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament inappropriate for the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They are starting to take Trump seriously.
When Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected as a party candidate, four out of ten people believe in Trump's chances, according to CNN and ORC poll.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on the line for Jeb Bush.
Overall: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball at their disposal before.
At this point in the last election, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28 percent considered Mitt Romney.
The majority seem to find the Trump campaign convincing.
Even if Republicans support another candidate, Trump will defeat almost all other candidates.
Some experts believe that the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump as Trump's opponents are divided into supporters of the various candidates.
A poll at Monmouth University in early September revealed that in an imaginary duel between Trump and almost any other Republican candidate, Trump would almost always win a larger support force over.
He runs Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and Rand Paul, John Kasich, and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump's only true opponent?
Ben Carson would win over Trump with a 19-point difference in a fictional duel.
A narrow majority of Trump supporters say they have already made a vote.
According to CBS and the NYT poll released Tuesday, more than half of Trump supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a sure voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's biggest rival at the moment is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already nominated are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of immigration.
After Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a hot topic of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's pompous speeches will expel important Latin American voters from Republican forces and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to ABC News and Washington Post polls released on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same page as Trump on immigration issues.
As long as immigration is in the spotlight, so is Donald Trump.
Dissatisfaction with the regime is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson currently garner about half of the Republican vote, and the popularity is significantly enhanced by the fact that both have been nominated as outsiders.
The Republican forces want a fresh face instead of a political veteran. According to the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans felt this way.
These two candidates are also angry at Washington.
According to a poll commissioned by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republican activities in Congress: 54 percent are dissatisfied and 21 percent are on the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corby's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since the election, Corbyn's first appearance at Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited
Labour Labour's new frontman Jeremy Corbyn is set to rise for the first time to fight his strength in David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn asks his first of six questions shortly after noon, with the media and Labour representatives following the man with a hard eye.
Corbyn has called for less theatre and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In the encounter, Corbyn's leadership is weighed for the first time in connection, and Corbyn is now put to parliamentary test after the gathering of the shadow government and his speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Confederation of Trade Unions, TUC, on Tuesday.
Labour's frontman's decision to remain silent at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the British Air War during the national anthem on Tuesday has received criticism from several Tory party representatives.
Corbyn's silence during the national anthem attracted attention
Corbyn's spokesman said Corbyn stood during the national anthem, quietly respecting the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Corbyn shadow board member Owen Smith said on the BBC's Two's Newsnight program that he would have urged the party leader to join the national anthem despite his opposition to this monarchy.
Ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's first team, citing disagreements in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than one sixth of the party originally supported Corbyn's election to party leadership.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant believes that political differences over UK membership of the EU and the conditions for granting benefits tightened by the government have piled up in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at the TUC meeting that Labour plans to propose changes to eliminate the restrictions altogether.
Hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions Smith of the Shadow Government stated that the party's position is very clear: it opposes only the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will face in the past decade as leader of the Tory Party.
Labour leader who promised a new approach to politics says he has chosen the questions asked to Cameron about the 30,000 proposals he received from the public.
Corbyn, elected from the Islington North constituency, said that Question Time has too many clashes, and he promises to avoid clever wording and mud throwing and says he will instead focus on serious topics such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corbyn has stated that shadow minister Angela Eagle is filling in for her during poll hours, for example, when Cameron is on a trip abroad.
Corbyn has also thrown in the idea that others could get out loud at times, saying that he had discussed this with John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons.
After Corbyn took party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-like policy, often associated with Question Time, but some years later he admitted to failing in his quest.
Since Question Time was first televised in 1990, it has been considered a key measure of the director's judgment, control of the House of Commons and position, but critics say that Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless young people to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and earn for a group of former street children has been found.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit filming studio that teaches homeless young people to photograph their home region and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who was among the first to graduate through the project.

Pounds strengthen as UK wages rise
The pound strengthened as wages rose in the UK, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index to an increase.
In May and July, wages in the UK rose by 2.9% compared to the corresponding period last year.
Faster than predicted growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound strengthened by 1% and its rate was quoted at $1,5505, and the pound also strengthened against the euro, and quoted at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose 1.49% and ended up at 6.229.21 points.
The biggest increase was made by SABMiller, whose rate was 20 percent higher when the company received a preliminary bid from a competing company AB InBev.
If completed, the deal would combine the two largest brewing companies in the world and bring brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 percent in the wake of the positive results of the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury goods.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast, and sales development was also a rise in Burberry's key markets in China.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant announced plans to raise $2.5 billion in the share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest drop in its 4.3% drop when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
JD Sports' rate rose 3.1% after the sports company announced that its return before taxes will rise by 83 percent to £46.6 million.
JD Sports boss: higher wage spending could hinder expansion
According to Peter Cowgill, chairman of JD Sports' management team, raising the minimum wage in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the higher labour costs incurred by the company.
Cowgill said the increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against Aldi's avalanche
Metcash is working to secure its IGA store from the Aldi takeover in South and Western Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grassroots campaign to maintain the IGA retail market share in South and Western Australia against the Aldi $700 million invasion.
Aldi plans to open two distribution centers and the first from up to 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand with marketing on mainstream media and social media, as well as organizing events like the Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastings in IGA stores, and merchants sell tickets to regular customers for games in the South Australian Football League at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to release more detailed information about its defence strategy on September 29, when the Food, Alcohol and Hardware Trade Wholesale will hold an annual investment strategy day.
This is a major market, with South and Western Australia accounting for nearly 30% of the footprint of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the margin yield is higher than that of the IGA store network in the eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their parochiality, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a market share of 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia, while in the eastern states the share is only 14%.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain will eat sales from all operators, but especially from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that the sale of IGA traders could be 360 million and Metcash could sell a $250 million notch by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and Western Australia next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in sales in these areas.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so losing food sales and volume could mean a $13 million loss in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath says.
Meanwhile, Metcast is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent study by Roy Morgan found that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, down from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Hamish Douglass, the leading portfolio manager of Magellan Financial Group, said at an event in Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to publicly comment on Douglass' comments.
Understandably, a member of the Metcash Board contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's food business, which serves 1200 IGA dealers, has lost 43% of 2012 levels, showing a decrease in debt financing as pressures are directed at sales and margins.
However, the wholesale operator takes countermeasures and makes an annual investment of over $150 million to match Coles and Woolworths prices for hundreds of products each week. The chain wants to support traders in renewing stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh produce and improve the food selection of the store's own brands.
According to Metcash CEO Ian Morrice, price revision and store renewal plans are well underway, and the company will be able to increase its profits again in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves a special mention of her behavior instead of criticism.
According to Steve Healy, president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a collateralized victim in a recent yupaka related to Nick Kyrgios.
The younger party of the two named the "Special K" duo, Kokkinakis, was caught in an unfavorable spotlight when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal ATP tournament.
Shortly thereafter, in a qualifying match between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison in Cincinnati, the judge had to separate the rivals twice. "Wawrinka should have kicked his ass with Kyrgiosis and my friend," Harrison said.
In the US Open, Kokkinakis struck the bat field frustrated when powerful cramps ruined his fight. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinak.
Currently, a teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for single player second place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against the UK.
"I strongly believe Thanasi has been drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match at the US Open. He is by no means the first player to break his bat due to frustration. I know Thanas well enough that he is not proud of what he did.
However, he has endured Harrison's provocative behavior in the U.S. Open very well, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature for 19 years old, he works hard and complements the team well. He has never had problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He practices hard, is in good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on his own merits."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios from the Australian team from an important round starting as a Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties involved. However, he supports the return of Canberra's breed to the team's long-term reinforcement.
"First of all, we want to focus fully on the matches instead of the polemics associated with Kyrgios," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray have pointed out, the young man has to grow up in the spotlight of publicity. He deserves the criticism he has received for his bad mistakes. However, we try to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We also try to arrange his own peace for him. I believe it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared an emergency, closed its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and arrested illegal migrants, with the aim of preventing the influx of migrants.
Chaos arose at the border as hundreds of migrants piled up in no-man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to stay on the road section between ground checkpoints in their tents indefinitely
Frustration began to surface.
As the police helicopter flew in the air above the migrants, they kept saying, "Open the border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
Some became protested against the hunger and drink strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister said it would not accept the sending of migrants back to Hungary at the same time as more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not increase the damage.
The situation must be discussed in Brussels and also in other countries in the next few days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbia border began a day later when a group of 28 countries failed in their efforts to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed that the responsibility for the 40 000 floods of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with the hope that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would accept 120,000 migrants, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the immigrant crisis on the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hope in the swift action of Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency developed so that in the two southern regions the authorities were allowed to adopt more effective means, i.e. to close roads and speed up legal processes in asylum matters.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence on the Romanian border to prevent a flow of migrants from the direction, now that a fence is already ready on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finishing of barbed wire fences between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of which are refugees from Syria and the rest of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of people arriving are standard of living refugees, not war refugees, who have the right to seek refuge.
Under the new law that came into force in Hungary at midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a four-meter-high barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border in the direction of Serbia, and the law also sets longer prison periods for convicted traffickers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a crisis situation in the country," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still has to approve the military action expected next week, and journalists from the Associated Press news agency at the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and military dogs for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's internal security adviser, said authorities have arrested 45 people trying to cross the border immediately at the border and 15 further away.
People who have crossed the border are now in police custody, and they are charged with crimes under new laws.
Authorities are quick to repair the fence.
In addition, two of the seven border crossings on the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday, one border crossing being closed by means of a barbed wire-covered train wagon.
Chaos took over the main border crossing near Roszke in Hungary when Hungarians opened a point of contact for a small metal container where people packed in.
About 20 could fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main street, which connects Serbia and Hungary, and people reported being on a hunger and drink strike until they were allowed into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership against Bernie Sanders contracted by half, according to the national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's support rate is still double-digit in the race for Democratic national presidential candidate, but Senator Bernie Sanders has bridged the gap.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the Democratic supporters' votes (a decline of 58%), compared to Sanders' second with 27% support (an increase from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure for the presidential race, and his support among Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the primary elections, it is too early for most Democrats to tell which candidate they are in favour of.
Clinton supporters, however, are more confident in their election than other candidates.
Since a poll commissioned by CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support for several Democratic groups, while new supporters have joined Sanders camp.
Clinton still has a solid leadership position among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has dropped significantly, with only a 5% bow over Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among Democrats under 50 and is now even with Sanders.
Clinton, however, still has a clear advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton's head start in supporting positions with Sanders among liberals was double-digit, but now Sanders has taken a five-percent neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of Democrats say they will be happy to support Clinton if she is elected as a party candidate.
A quarter would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic supporters too if she is elected as a candidate.
There is more dispersal in the views among those who are not currently in favor of Clinton, and only about a quarter would enthusiastically support him.
48% of Democratic voters would support Clinton, while only 35% of Republican voters would enthusiastically support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When asked to freely describe why they support his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's right experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13 percent) and thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
In addition, the common views and chances of winning the actual elections are mentioned.
The Vice President is still weighing his possible candidacy, and 57% of Democratic voters would like him to join the race, but a third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the Democratic voters are asked about the second most popular candidate for the party, most choose Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half of Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase her head start over Sanders, and with Sanders, the head start is 20 percentage points, and it will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton a candidate with the best chance of winning the actual election, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
Biden, number two, is far from Clinton, but more people believe Biden can win the actual election.
However, Democratic voters consider views on factual issues to be more important than the candidates' chances of winning.
Voters do not consider any of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates unacceptable.
Voters consider Democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable in terms of characteristics.
Most people think Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable, and leadership types.
Biden is most often described as honest, while Clinton is most often considered the type of leader.
As many as 30% of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, while Sanders is 15%. 27% can't tell if Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the voters' own ideology.
For all features, there is no opinion on Sanders in about a quarter.
When asked for views on Hillary Clinton's use of private email and her own server as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and it has not changed these voters' perception of Clinton.
Americans more broadly disagree.
Half of Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and only a third are satisfied.
The public's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the controversial use of email has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
While voters in their own party consider Clinton honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these features when asked about the views of all voters: Clinton is considered honest and reliable by only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country also do not consider Trump honest and reliable.
Both Clinton and Trump receive good grades for leadership.
Of the six candidates included in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
The majority think Sanders is honest, but just like with Carson, many people don't have an opinion on Sanders.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters, and the margin of error in the survey is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson reaches for Donald Trump's head start in national support poll
According to CBS News and the New York Times' latest support poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
The two candidates took more than half of the vote in the new poll, and left the other candidates far behind.
Among Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The support share has risen from 23% in a CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month. According to a survey released on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
Carson's support, however, triggered a staggering rise in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all population groups, and in the group of higher education graduates, he narrowly outperforms Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, are far behind, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support being the weakest and falling from 10% last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio shared third place with 6% support.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% one way or the other. The survey was conducted in September.
According to CNN and ORC's latest survey, released last week, Carson's support is on the rise, supported by 19% of Republicans, compared to 32 percent of Trump's support.
In the latest poll by ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was also in clear leadership ahead of Carson.
In a men's meeting last week, Trump made false accusations to a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said Saturday while campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the staff charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student in a student ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are read murder charges.
Members of the Pi Delta Ps staff at Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng at a baptism in September 2013. Police said the staff did not deliver Deng to the hospital in time, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
Authorities said the victim's eyes were tied, a backpack filled with sand nearly 15 kg had been placed on his back, and he had been repeatedly attacked while trying to reach the target placed across the icy field.
Deng is reported to have first complained of a headache and then lost consciousness.
Police said members of the Pi Delta Ps staff did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, allegedly waiting an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Police Commissioner Chris Wabner said at a press conference that members could change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Chairman Andy Meng.
"At this point, members began to hide equipment, putting the benefit of the cooperative ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy record, Deng had been hit several times in the head, to the upper body, and to the thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the chimping of the cooperative, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the clam since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The committees and their members must be held accountable, where the authorities must take an important step.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County proposed five members of the fraternity to be charged with a third-degree murder.
In addition, 32 members of the fraternity are charged with shellfishing and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to get the responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organization that officially or informally approved the clam," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a ban on the staff, and the national staff resigned from the local department.
This is how the increase in interest rates of the Federal Reserve (Fedin) affects
Interest rate increases and the stock market boom grope, securities returns rise and the economy slides into recession.
We know that.
We don't know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
Especially in terms of the economy, we find a clue in history about timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, though not always. The crucial factor is how the economy and financial assets react.
Therefore, central bank officials have already been vehemently stressed that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates, but to how long it will take for the situation to normalise.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
However, in the end, market participants may find that any fuss about raising interest rates may be exaggerated.
"The first withdrawal of the central bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, told his clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual normalization of interest rates to a fairly low level, which is a frightening seismic shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here are historical trends based on examples of how impacts can be reflected in different aspects of the economy:
As has been seen in the market for about a month, the omen of interest rate increases can increase instability for a while.
When interest rates finally rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"Trend appears to have a stagnation in capital interest income after the first withdrawal for 12 to 24 months, which perhaps again reflects a delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank's analyst said in a recent study of the consequences of the rise in interest rates.
In a revised 35-year period, the market usually sees a sharp rise in interest rates at the time of the rise, about 14 percent, fairly steady for the next 250 days (average increase of 2.6 percent), after 500 days, the situation normalizes, and the average interest rate return after six stock cycles is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on stocks tends to intensify at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest income begins to decrease.
The recession is a fact in the economy, but the rise in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and could accelerate the downturn.
It is particularly noteworthy that GDP is at its lowest ever in terms of raising the central bank's key interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 key interest rates have been raised since 1950, only twice has the nominal value been less than 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 percent, many did not imagine it would last, and the third quarter is 1.5%, says Atlanta Regional Central Bank.
In raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be risks and one might ask whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the key interest rate all year, and the eyes turn to this week's Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
Many strategists and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee approves the withdrawal at this meeting, futures trading will show only a 25% probability.
"In our studies since 1950, all lifting cycles to this day have been in a supercycle where GDP falling before the downturn is also rising very rapidly since the boom began," the report states.
Recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression of the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is already the 74th month.
Fixed-income securities have also been volatile as the market foresight increases interest rates, and the formula is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the impact is faster in bonds than in stocks when the central bank changes the rate.
For bonds, the return seems to change direction immediately when the first up/down cycle starts.
At the end of the upswing cycle, returns will fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that interest rate raising causes long- and short-term bonds to approach each other and the curve to smooth out.
"High-income bonds often do better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about returns," said Kathy Jones, an analyst for Schwab's fixed-income securities.
Fascinatingly, Jones says the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the dollar's strengthening and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of adapting to the tightening of financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is direct, credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased. All are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank tightens the policy.
Widely speaking, companies that operate mainly in the US market benefit because interest rates are falling and local products are beginning to attract.
The outlook for indebted multinationals is weaker, as the strengthening dollar will cause their products to tilt in the global market and the debt to rise.
"History shows that quality stocks will be more lucrative over the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts told their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet outperformed weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rates.
Companies with high return on capital, as well as low volatility shares, also fared better in quality, an average of 4 and a correspondingly 3 percentage points better.
"The debt is a big question.
Companies with a significant share of variable rate debt lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the strengthening of the dollar.
Savers also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are visible.
Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for too much popularization.
Bingham says it is difficult to separate the channel from its commercial competitor today.
Also claims the BBC Music Awards are only a copy of the Brits Awards.
Parliamentarian Damien Collins, on the other hand, accuses The Voice of impersonality.
According to a prominent parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 is gradually becoming a copy of the Classic FM channel, which increases the pressure on the station to prove that it offers other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC leadership that the radio channel of the broadcaster is becoming too populist and the channel is not much different from its commercial competitor.
"I hate to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards, held last December, also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards, held for the first time last year, seem like a copy of the Brits Awards.
These two are examples of just imitating what is already on the market instead of new and different," Bingham says.
The BBC Director-General denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers significantly more live music and enlightening content than a commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3, I learned from classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and making music is in a class of its own.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," the CEO said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey said that the station needs to work even harder to maintain the public's interest, as the British are more familiar with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only one who has received criticism for entering the territory of commercial channels, in the hearing of the Limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory parliamentarian Damien Collins criticized The Voice talent show, which the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media, an estimated price of £22 million.
"There is little discussion about the program, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
Lord Hall said the BBC1 programme, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced as typical of the BBC.
Collins also insisted that the company find a hit show in its own stable the next time it launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins refused to rule out the fact that The Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other entertainment formats.
Online store growth the slowest ever in August - perhaps due to Black Friday
In the first months of 2015, e-commerce grew by seven per cent.
Sales in e-commerce have been recorded since 2000, and last month growth was the slowest ever.
The online store strengthened three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that November's Black Friday can curb the desire to buy.
The conquest of e-commerce, which has been going on for over ten years, has deserted many of Britain's shopping streets.
Experts say there are indications that e-commerce is levelling off, and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
In August, total sales growth was slowest throughout the period when e-commerce sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, e-commerce grew by only five per cent.
Experts say there are indications that e-commerce is levelling off, and new sales figures show only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you compare last year's growth to the 2000s, it's clear that growth will level off over time," IMRG editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online shopping accelerated three years ago as consumers adopted mobile shopping.
"It allowed more and more people to buy online, and for many, buying was possible in a different environment, for example from a couch at home.
With mobile buying now more moderate, growth can level off."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is considered one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
Experts say that the theme day to be celebrated on the last Friday of November can cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before Black Friday.
Last year, five times the normal number of online buyers caused many traders' websites to crash.
Experts believe that a black Friday that causes consumers to shove after offers can curb the desire to buy at another time.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a good pound for every £5 was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased in online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping street fashion stores.
In Mecca, victims of crane accidents are buried, Bin Laden's family is held accountable
Muslims carried the bodies of 29 victims in the streets when the first funeral was held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia says the construction company Saudi Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Bodies were carried high in the air when Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the crane that fell on the Grand Mosque of Mecca
A number of white-dressed people had gathered on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The Surusaatue ran through a pilgrimage site where a fallen building crane had only a day earlier penetrated through the roof of the mosque on Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia is calling on Bin Laden's construction family business to be responsible for an accident that injured an additional 394 people.
The bodies of 29 victims killed in the Mekka Grand Mosque crane accident were transported in the streets.
After the crane fell, among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been in the Great Mosque with his parents, who were about to begin their annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have promised that a hajj pilgrimage will take place when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
King Salman said Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom up when the crane was not used.
According to an Arabic press release, Binladin Group is partly responsible for the accident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report in detail. However, according to an English-language press release, the Group management is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the Great Mosque yard. Thousands of Muslims head to the Great Mosque for a hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not published a bulletin on the crane accident, and the Group's representatives have not been reached for the statement.
The king also accused the group of not complying with up-to-date safety regulations and cooperating with meteorology experts.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Suurmuskeijja as part of Binladin Group's giant construction project.
The Bin Laden family has had close links with the Saudi ruling family for decades, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was an apostate boy who had been abandoned by the family in the 1990s.
The cranelessness in heavy rain and strong wind occurred just days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which it is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
Officials say 158 people are still hospitalized.
Authorities ordered one million riles (about 250,000 euros) to be paid to the families of the victims and permanently disabled.
The other injured in the accident will receive half of the compensation amount.
B&Q boss says the phenomenon is driven by cheap Eastern European workforce
The British hire home handymen more often than ever, says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by skilled, professional workers arriving from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new Screwfix stores for workmen will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, lead correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be moving the hammering and painting work of the home to authors from Eastern Europe.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce today.
The British are now increasingly hiring home handymen to do home nicking work, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns a chain of home renovation supplies. According to Laury, the phenomenon is driven by skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at affordable prices.
As a result of this phenomenon, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q stores will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by a woman.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to Laury, population trends should be taken into account, as more and more women living alone are also renovating their homes today.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions for products are made by a woman.
Women play a significant role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women at the helm of companies belonging to the British FTSE 100 index, and has also rearranged the company's management team so that there are equal male and female leaders.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its kind, with exactly 50% of its staff being women, including CEO and CFO.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
Kingfisher's six-month operating profit and sales figures are declining, even though the company worked hard after the stores were closed.
Kingfisher responds to current trends: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-ace government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of SAK and other wage earners' central organizations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to a widespread demonstration by the workers.
Many people think that reason also stands.
Let's ask if it's worth the strikes when things are going bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been established.
More than 50,000 people have already been online to announce that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In the old good consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no web to protest on, but openly declaring yourself a rich person would have been a political suicide of a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people in a million-member trade unions does not bother much, but it does give us something to think about.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as self-evident as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, the values have changed
From the perspective of the attractiveness of the Ay movement, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of looking like things are rolling on their own, now the unions are finally getting to the point of defending, visibly and properly defending the rights of the employee.
The government can thus perhaps want to capture the role of the trade union movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline, and unemployment is rising.
These things should force everyone's head.
University of Lappeenranta has a hard savings course: Aiming for 8.5 million in savings, staff will be reduced by 130
Lappeenranta University of Technology is starting a savings course, which aims to reduce costs by a total of 8.5 million euros.
As part of the savings, the university will start co-operation negotiations for all personnel, with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means reducing about 130 employees.
In addition, two million are being saved from other activities.
The Yt negotiations are based on the 2016 budget, which anticipates that the actual operations will be 8.5 million in deficit.
It is also affected by the government's cuts in appropriations.
In this financial year, the university will make approximately 2.6 million in deficit.
Expenses will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is about 85 million euros, so the savings target is ten percent of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate finance on our university is very significant," says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university statement.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in complementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with shop stewards will be launched on Tuesday next week and will last six weeks as prescribed by law.
Onnibus wants Finland on the railways
Sir Brian Souter, owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, tells Yle that the company is also aiming for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in getting involved in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is to open up to competition gradually.
The first is commuter traffic in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in 2017-2018.
After commuter traffic, long-distance traffic is on the move.
Souter says he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, the Ministry of Transport welcomes Onnibus' plans.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also has bus services in Finland and rail services in other parts of Europe.
U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision time
The whole world is following the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
More than half of economists who believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates now bet the central bank would maintain interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25%, as evidenced by a survey commissioned by 80 economists in Reuters.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has been keeping the interest rate close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus start normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought trillions of additional dollars to the balance sheet and has accelerated little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy.
It has urged the market to prepare for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday 20.00 Central European times.
Delta State University shooter leaves apology note
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for forgiveness for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, authorities said Tuesday.
Lamb, teaching geography and social science at Delta State University in Gautier, Mississippi, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and said he shot a person.
Lamb asked the police to his home in an emergency call.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. She also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house that has no harm to anyone but is probably scared.
Police asked for the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb also did not give any motive for the shooting.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41,'s body and a message written by Lamb by hand, which read: "I'm very sorry and I wish I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before taking his life late Monday when police reached him.
University principal William LaForge said he was unaware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt, but authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence on the triangular drama.
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for seven years, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
The man said that the daughter and mother were best friends.
According to the Sun Herald, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles reported that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles noted that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them he was not going to jail.
When police reached Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville that night, Lamb stopped the car, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and took his own life.
According to a resume on the university site, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Dimmed Stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that happened has really taken its toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw on the sidelines for months due to two fractures
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in a Manchester United Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is saddened to stay on the sidelines for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes Shaw will return to the fields this season.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in a bad tackle by Héctor Moreno in the PSV defensive area when fifteen minutes were running.
Shaw was given first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures on his leg and is hospitalized," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or the day after for surgery to Manchester.
The young man, who joined Manchester United at the age of 18, has been through a lot and is now injured after some great playing ideas.
In the locker room, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks from two points, he's on the sidelines for half a month and he's not playing in the block stage anymore.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed to have gotten away with not following a red card penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You can deduce for yourself, but I thought it was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-foot reckless tackle."
Shaw tweeted, "Thank you all for your messages. I can't describe in words how overwhelmed I am. My recovery starts here and I'll be back even stronger."
More about Manchester United's Luke Shaw page in PSV match
The English defender has a special reason to recover to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"It's a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such injuries, all parties are always very sorry.
Players are never meant to harm an opponent."
Moreno broke his legs while playing the Netherlands led by Van Gaal in Mexico until the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very sorry, because he didn't intend to harm the opponent. It's a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation myself.
I only saw a ball going the other way, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke tackle."
"I know how it feels, and I know how difficult this can be," Moreno told SBS6.
"I feel really bad, I'm very sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better
Every parent will eventually find that the child learns his favorite book almost by heart.
Except for what you see, David Cameron.
When the children's holiday organization asked Cameron to name his favorite children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, a 1971 teaching environmental story by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is funny, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message we have never noticed before."
Sounds good, except the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complement the short original text.
"In the city of Tarville, where real trees and plants have disappeared and even air is merchandise, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey by realizing this biggest dream: to see the right tree," the text says. In 1991, in the version of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died, Ted had no object of infatuation.
Unless this is suspicious enough yet, Cameron's text is partly in line with the plot summary of the movie Lorax on the Internet Movie Database. It begins as follows: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is merchandise, there lives a boy named Ted who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the plot of the book would be this foreign to him. Greedy Kerskanen disposes of trees and makes them Tarvis despite opposition from the title character Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, mustache creature that protects forests.
Likely, this kind of public relations task is entrusted to an assistant, apparently one who has not read Lorax 20 times in a row as a child,.
A spokesman for the Prime Minister said the text probably came from the Cameron constituency office.
SuperCamps did not comment further on the matter, but confirmed that the text was written by Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being away from the English team, but it is still tough
The encounter with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the repeat of the last 3-0 Test series loss of the team selected for the tour in England, it is not expected.
I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a guest win.
The Alastair Cook side may be more inexperienced than the three-year-old team, but the batting team has good players and the team's attitude is strong — they don't have bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positivity.
As a spherical player, Moeen Ali develops as a twist pitcher, and Adil Rashid, although he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test team and replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, the decision to leave Adam Lyth out is hard for me to understand as his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricketers are criticized according to the results.
Joe Root, for example, is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best voters.
A few 50-point matches should have been held on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire for more runs.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he didn't do as well as he could, which doesn't surprise me.
The question of how long a Test striker will have the opportunity to impress is difficult.
Lyth had seven national matches — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was given the opportunity in both home and away games.
The only thing to complain about is perhaps that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in top shape — but this past opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales comes on the team and he's a hitter I appreciate high.
He is an unknown author cricketer, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be granted at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this of course depends on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moeen will start a batting shift with Cook, giving us an extra twist pitcher for the game while holding four quick pitchers, and I'm not against the idea.
I don't see the obstacle to a top pitcher being able to hit here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricketer.
Moeen may not have accomplished much on his local team in Worcestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test games as the first replacement player before he could start in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a spare thread pitcher, and based on what I have seen about him, he has proven to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics — an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a pitcher — and this may be a search shot, but not many twist pitchers have shown themselves ready, and the selectors decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this match trip.
Outside the playing team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batter, Mahela Jayawardene, as an advisor to Test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most sweetest men in the sport, bringing with him a lot of experience because he has played in all kinds of conditions and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on a game trip to the white ball section and brings both energy and ruthlessness.
I think he has always seemed to fit international cricket, whether his role is player or coach, and like Mahela, he has the intelligence to use.
Sometimes a new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, can be a stimulant injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one-day games, Root had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not set a match schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their workplace depends on the results.
These decisions are never made without consideration.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is in a bad state 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for Britain's stay in the EU is in an ever deeper swamp every day, even without the pleasant Jeremy "yes or no" Corbyniak's election to the Labour leadership or TUC mocking Europe fiercely on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained how many crises the EU is wallowing in — although not everyone is an act of its own; some Member States are tired of Britain's smug agenda, which includes dissensing concessions and damaging Treaty changes that they don't really even want.
In Brighton, the annual TUC Congress decided that they would not like the EU either if it eroded social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, grab a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and say they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an open-minded Britain inside the EU tent. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point where we no longer care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's thoughtfully reasonable Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it spoils, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande of France is facing a re-election or a follow-up in 2017.
His power is fading too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, while Spain may have a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing to help selfie Britons who could use their energy better to try to stop Scotland from leaving the UK, and they don't want that either, because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some such ministers can plan to deliberately throw useless comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the UK's 2017 popular election campaign to hasten the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a case, and there was nothing left in the UK for the renegotiation."
Europeans know how the British press preys and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum by Tony Benn, the result of which advocated 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Someone may remotely remember Boris Johnson, a fellow European opportunist who became known as our "EU direct banana correspondent" in Brussels in the early 90s.
Ed Miliband at least knew his enemies.
They include tax circulating, phones hacking, and pseudo-temporary residents who own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought roughly the same about them, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to hand out bananas to distract you so that the gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was also more liberal than Blair in his opposition to the referendum, after all, he agreed to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back at Westminster on Monday. I told him he didn't have time to waste on me anymore. There may be a risk of him introducing Neil Kinnock's media boycott strategy from the '80s. It was a mistake and still is.
Time may pass, but Corbyn needs to develop a consistent strategy for dating the media, not with me, but Andrew Marrin, whom he sat on on on the BBC couch on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we politely call build-up.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukipin and Tory can probably answer yes to this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week when her inner Boy Scout tried not to admit that it was a bad move for Corbyn to appoint rugged John McDonnell as Minister of Shadow Finance.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his old father had trouble being disloyal on television to his Labour party colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the House of Commons.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under "all circumstances". McDonnel did not say that or to Corby's colleagues and members of the House of Commons at a private meeting on Monday night.
Wanted Corby to convey any kind of sucking image, it must be remembered that he even touched me. Message discipline is important in the 24/7 era, especially in the social media discipline, where paranoia and deception smolder.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU to take Labour's support for granted in a referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
McDonnell and Corbyn's equation of EU membership is appropriate for the bent blockade economy and the past against capitalism. Discussions no longer belong to a narrow circle of leftist dissidents, to whom the idea of similarity unites is a key doctrine in doctrinal villains.
The qualification has also been seen for NATO. Tom Watson is unflinching in that Corbyn does not campaign for departure. Foreign diplomats are forced to try to clarify the matter to their home countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, have suspicious voters, why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the British's miserable military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even the cuts during the Tory government, which I received a reminder of on Monday at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize British authority's statements on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a state-funded institution that e-cigarette smoking is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were generated at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticized the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the Public Health England (PHE) e-cigarette report.
PHE described its report, published last month, as "a translational and comprehensive review of the results."
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the data and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet Medical Journal last month took a "significantly weak foundation" on the teeth, on which the PHE's main conclusion is based.
Two researchers have also wondered in BMJ whether the claims were based on "rock or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, have stated the following: "The basic assumption of public health care is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the best estimate today is that e-cigarettes are about 95 percent less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim stems from one meeting of 12 people, convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model. The model was intended to harmonise the participants' views on the harms of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled for the study.
According to McKee and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO's previous independent research has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT), according to sources.
In addition, the CEO demonstrated his support for BAT's public health activities in the report on sustainable operations.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but the alleged previous funding from tobacco company Philip Morris International was not granted by that participant.
No explanation of the criteria for selecting the panel composition has been provided, but there are several well-known e-cigarette supporters, some of whom admit their involvement as an industry financier.
However, some participants are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco manager also attended the meeting.
According to McKee and Capewell, the group's research report shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmfulness of the products with regard to a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, no links or shortcomings are mentioned in the PHE report.
According to a PHE report, no evidence has been provided so far that e-cigarettes can promote smoking in children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's Director of Health and Well-being, the allegations have been responded to before.
Fenton says e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
One in two people who smoke throughout life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco, but the long-term effects need to be further investigated.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in a situation where relative hazards compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
There are nearly 80,000 smoking-related deaths in the UK each year, and smoking costs public health care £2 billion annually.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, who was in charge of Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop broadcasting certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said commercial competitors would give their right hand to hit shows such as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that other television stations do not.
He criticized the BBC for presenting programmes that are likely to reach a smaller audience at the same time as the high ratings of competitors, as well as on BBC4, for example.
After BBC Director General Tony Hall announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organizations, Johnson said he had been trying to get Channel 4 to collaborate with the BBC for six years, without success.
"I do not agree with the idea of the BBC buying formats and broadcasting programmes that would clearly be part of the programme of some competing channel," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If the BBC wants to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply to at least programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC is sending The Voice at prime time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If no other channel takes care of the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programs that could be funded without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, although it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand on it.
I do not understand how this serves the service offering of the broadcaster.
I don't think this would be a loss to the BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in charge of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2012. He thinks the BBC is looking for good ratings because ambitious people work in the company and because they believe it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to those of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested with his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that the BBC sell out series like EastEnders.
Johnson said that programmes for the BBC niche audience are shown on BBC4, where ratings cannot be measured most often, but programs fulfill their purpose. "BBC can say that in defending £4 billion in broadcasting fees with its hypocritical missions, it did make special programs that no one watched."
"BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
Johnson said, "I challenge you to find another system as old-fashioned in that who gets the best out of it.
Of course, everyone thinks that £150 a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big deal, especially if you don't look at the BBC very much."
Former Sky and Channel 5 channel leader David Elstein, who also expressed his own views in committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should exchange its ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programs in the BBC's current offering — 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that the BBC should learn from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and rewind its mission: "information, enlighten and entertain".
Elstein suggests that the BBC could increase broadcasts on events such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were broadcast only a fraction last year. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels to make the entire offering available online as well," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves by sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle worm changes direction when they are subjected to ultrasound.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems, allowing worms to be controlled by ultrasound.
Small nematodes change direction when they are subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the hearing range of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that are genetically modified to have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
More on the subject: Scientists monitor brain activity with light
According to the researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the efficacy of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics). In the method, ultrasound is used to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an stimulus from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at Salk Instute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method can one day replace deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms, in which the brain is stimulated by electrical impulses.
The nematodes normally do not respond to ultrasound. However, Chalasani noticed that the worms begin to react when placed in a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
Chalasan says bubbles intensify ultrasonic waves that advance inside worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP4 ion channels, which are found in some of the cell membranes of worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are attached to.
In order to control the nematodes by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that TRP4 ion channels appeared on some of the nerves that control their movement.
When ultrasound was directed to the modified worms, the microcups strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, allowing a signal to start in the nerve cell.
The method is somewhat similar to optogenetics, a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate neurons using light.
However, Chalasan says that sonogenetics has certain advantages over optogenetics.
Light is directed to the brain under study by optical fibers. Low frequency ultrasounds, on the other hand, easily penetrate the cell, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic therapy and viral therapy can temporarily expose human neurons to ultrasound signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - at your door!
Ads are a disgrace to British arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-arms fair video.
Creepy killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leg irons!
Grape bombs!
Remote tasers that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The video is produced by Amnesty International and is intended to highlight the British government's efforts to sell weapons to repressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair, which is held at the ExCel Exhibition Centre in Docklands, London.
More about: DSEI weapons fair: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
Bus stops and metro cars also pop posters that require another glance.
"Important announcement: are you taking the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement resembles the London Metro announcements in appearance. At the end of the metro line on the other side is a picture of the tanker.
"In September, a group of arms dealers arrive in Docklands, and customers are asked for help to stop the arms fair."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists whose works were exhibited at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute posters across London with a six-pound "advertising space hacking package" with hex wrenches that allegedly allow access to about one-third of the world's bus stop advertising poster stands.
Transport for London is not a way of making vandalism laugh.
One of the spoil ads of the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists have begun to question things and want to bring their political work outside the galleries to the public.
Artists have found that social influence through art requires that art is brought to the real world. Many people move on to work with activists of protest movements.
One of the posters against the arms trade greets public transport users on the subway.
Amnesty International's video has been viewed over 100,000 times a day via Facebook, designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the narrator have also done their job without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, was puzzled by the absence of trade fair advertising and an empty spot in ExCeL's event calendar. He thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get a more realistic, shady corporate video, but bright colors and animation attract better attention."
"They've done a great job and helped us bring up fairs where illegal torture equipment trade is taking place," said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded right at our doorstep."
However, perhaps the most creative offering of the weapons fair is on display in the exhibition spaces themselves at ExCeL, where exhibitors take advantage of amazing euphemisms about their merchandise.
In a press release, Saab announced an order by the U.S. military for the "portable AT4CS RS."
The product includes a "specially shaped warhead that effectively penetrates the target directly."
Doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for those living in student dormitories
I moved to a student dormitory 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old and still believed in baretts and moral relativism. Only now do I remember the violent smiles of those I provoked, and countless, long complaints about others.
The most important lessons I can summarize in eight simple rules.
Moving to the dormitory is at its mildest a strenuous experience and at worst shocking.
You start rambling easily in a situation: you tell everyone where you are from, whether you liked the gap year, and why, what you like about Corbyn, and why you don't "really hate or love Marmite, because it's just yeast extract, hahahaha, I'm in my room."
Breathe sometimes.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask others questions.
Asking questions guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your lashes were in flames and these people would share fire extinguishers.
Give others space.
Own rooms often serve as drinking counters, cinemas and public lounges, but a private room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More on this subject: Don't even think about combining dating and college studies
For Introverts, the university is a tough place
However, many dormitories form a social culture where you wander from room to room and form lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for someone who needs a place to recover.
It's not possible to say in this environment, "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out of here so I can recharge the energy I used to date you."
Try to observe if one of your fellow students is exhausted from social interaction, and perhaps it would be worth not knocking on the door and sending a text instead.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
There was a guy in my own student dorm who thought an unlocked door meant he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Make friends by baking.
You start your studies appropriately when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50s, a little weird case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I'll bake you something small. Smile when I ask you personals."
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your college friends have to talk to you, and a pleasant surprise can leave them with a positive picture of you.
This of course requires reasonable baker skills from you.
If you serve unhappy lumps made of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Flogging food is also a common violation in student dormitories.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop in your tea from someone else's milk can?
Always make sure of the milk carton owner.
You will probably get permission, even if the milk quote yurps the owner of the can.
I understand it's annoying if someone is whining about you, but try to handle it as adultly as possible, unlike my own fellow student who loitered detergent into his milk as a punishment for milk thieves.
She's in prison now.
Don't make noise when others are trying to sleep or push.
Not only because it is polite, but it is also worth remembering that every other pit digs...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the next room resident to adjust the music to a smaller one, as it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam this morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When the next room finally quieted down, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she went for three hours to take the exam, left the music in her room, and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be strange if you first thought your college friend was your future spouse, started dating, divorced, and had to see him every day, and lost the right of meeting with your mutual friends to him?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, and if the college buddy is definitely not the only one, try to control your desire.
If you find in a hilarious moment that someone has forgotten their keys in a room whose door is not locked, the line between prank and bullying is more fluctuating than you might think.
A good joke is funny, but one that you recover from in an instant.
Hiding an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no one's room should be messed with toothpaste and shampoo.
The door of the second room can be locked and dropped keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach anyone's things to the ceiling with a blue sticker a couple of times more.
Racist attack on foreign students' accommodation on Kitee - The planned house for reception centre was smeared in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the accommodation of foreign students on Saturday morning in Kitee, North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, it is not accommodation for underage asylum seekers, but sleeping facilities for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time," says Heidi Luukkainen, teacher at Kitee Evangelical Folk High School.
The windows and walls of the folk high school accommodations were smeared with racist signs such as swastikas, and a metal object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation, according to the Eastern Finnish police.
According to Luukkainen, the responsible teacher of youth social guarantee education at the Folk High School, an estimated ten people were in the building under vandalism at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adult people are free to move, so some may have been elsewhere," Luukkainen says.
People from 12 different nationalities are accommodated at the Folk High School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone in a messed-up building has a status.
Some study in adult primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Eastern Finland police are investigating the attack as an act of damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luukkainen, a briefing was held for students on Monday, with the necessary interpreters also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for over a decade, and this is the first time something like this has happened," Luukkainen says.
Luukkainen says the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
At least three men were suspected of being the perpetrators and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the whim of a youth weekend night, as this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," Luukkainen says.
A hospital has also been smeared in Salo, where a reception centre has been planned.
The incident occurred last week.
This was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
A swastika was drawn on the hospital wall and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal complaint has been filed with the police.

State shuts down Y train to Karjaa - passengers in their hands, "just idiotic"
The Y train from Helsinki to Karjaa in Raseborg will stop running in March.
The news indignant passengers boarding the early evening shift of that train at Helsinki Central Station.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It is idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing more than political will or lack thereof.
Bengtström says in an interview video from HSTV that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There are also train changes elsewhere in Uusimaa.
H and R trains running on the main line are combined into a new R line.
Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will purchase train services on during the next contract period.
The contract period changes at the turn of the year and routes to be closed are available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be finalised in the autumn will be later approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström from Siuntio believes that the state train cutter is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made in the past and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then comes repentance.
The Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyry from Espoo was annoyed by the fate of those travelling further away from the urban area by train.
"It's just bad for those who have to redesign their journey," he said as he climbed the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection will probably be coming to the beach track, replacing the Y train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) area, i.e. taking you all the way to Kirkkonummi.
This will bring more costs to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service level and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to accurately estimate the cost.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million a year for the Y train, of course, much more than this.
The R-line on the main track misses two stations.
In contrast, the number of train services in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will cease throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route is shortened to Pieksämäki-Varkaus.
Train services are reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka Harbour and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips are made per year with discontinued services, compared to approximately nine million trips in total traffic purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital Currentity: "Marx is worth getting to know"
The crises in the global economy have brought to the surface Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes George Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SVP, in Marx's Capital topicality, published today.
"He will now be taken more seriously than he has in a long time," Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of the capitalist economy more and more widely into all walks of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved amazingly farsighted.
The author list of the book based on the Capital seminars organised by Hakanen also includes Aalto University Professor, prestigious financial expert Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is topical "now and forever".
Is the former CEO of the Research Institute for Business and the Business Delegation not Marxist?
At least not.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx a topical economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary connoisseur.
"The usual idea is that the history of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went hard wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and importance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early days of capitalism, Korkman ponders.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now we are discussing Marx's interests again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may be able to inspire anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the world that is changing as a result of the technical upheaval," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful to Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
Yet, in Korkman's opinion, Marx is worth getting to know.
"In the 1970s, Marx could not be read," Korkman says.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's mindset - as with other classics," Korkman says.
UN calls for war criminals to be convicted in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for a special court to investigate war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the Civil War of 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long postponement.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamil tigers of war crimes.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the Sri Lankan Civil War.
There is no specific information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack by the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report accuses torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be victims as men as women.
The rebels have been guilty of forcing bystanders and children to become fighters, according to the report.
Both sides have committed the murders, according to the report.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
England's yo-test allowed social media to be weighed
The autumn matriculation examination included a long foreign language on Wednesday, which the majority had English.
England's skills were tested by more than 16,000 pledges.
The experiment could write the subject on social media.
Based on our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English 150-250 word article could be addressed to the administrator of the online magazine's counseling column.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the Finnish Leelia recliner.
He was asked for advice on how to get parents to look at things for young people as well.
In total, there were four subjects of the subject, one of which had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," estimates Mia Lybeck, lecturer in English at Porvoo Swedish-speaking high school.
The third topic was only a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has been practicing writing speeches," Lybeck says, evaluating the entire experiment as "quite normal."
In English - or Swedish - the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts that were wearing, for example, the adaptation of summer flounder to climate change and the processing of large masses of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn articles will continue on Friday, when the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, test will take place.
In high schools, the test is arranged normally, meaning that it is not affected by the protest of wage earners.
The Student Qualifications Board invites the pledges to find suitable transport connections in time so that they can attend the trial.
You can also get more time if you can show that the delay was not due to your negligence.
Oulu robbed of trade at gunpoint
A shop was robbed in Oulu on Wednesday morning in the Kello district.
Police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and a commando beanie covering his face.
He is normal and about 30 years old.
Police said the man had threatened staff with a handgun and had caught a small amount of money.
This is being investigated as a aggravated robbery.
Police prepare for tens of thousands of protesters to arrive in Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
The protest against the government's cuts will block the centre of Helsinki on Friday, the police predict.
According to preliminary data, as many as tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, Akava and STTK unions meet at Railway Square at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
Police officers at work, on the other hand, are not only responsible for alerting tasks and other police activities, but also for securing the smooth running of the giant demonstration.
Roads leading to the railway square are closed to motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 a.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi roundabout, from the west from Mannerheimintie.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it seems that enough is enough.
I am not taking a stand on the police's industrial action issues.
According to Kujala, support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to the demonstration.
The exact number of patrols is not reported by the police.
"Somewhat is coming, but as a rule we can do it on our own," Kujala says.
Police are urging you to avoid private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic sump extends from the Hakaniemi level to the city centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning until early evening.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, there are also a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They are not allowed in the Railway Square.
Buses are quite far away.
The rest of the trip must then be walked to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is a positive side to this.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand in these large crowd gatherings, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go calmly.
People are ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
After all, Finns are sensible and peaceful people," Kujala says.
Local protests will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's demonstration is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The big demonstration organised by the trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional in many ways.
For example, there is no very good benchmark for it in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology Emeritus Martti Siisiinen of the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the trade union movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard grips are missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the trade union movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the trade union movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the trade union movement by no means has the support of all wage earners for Friday's protests.
What is new now is the sharp division that the demonstration brings about in the crowd that the trade union movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered from all over Finland demonstrated at the Parliament House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a benchmark for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, a 1993 Murrostorstai, Siisiäinen says.
Organized in the middle of the deepest recession, Murrostorstai brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (Centre) government stumbles from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and employee organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois government.
Now the relationship between the government and the trade union movement is perhaps even worse than it was in the time of Murrostorstai.
Besides, the toughest bourgeois government in Finland ever is in power now, Siisiinen says.
The current coalition government is still interesting in such a way that it is so strictly right-wing despite the speeches of the Finns Party.
At the time of the thunder, there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres and schools.
Although the demonstration does not receive the undivided support of wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki each year.
There are a wide range of them.
Traditionally, Finnish trade union protests have been quite peaceful - although the operating methods have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, a Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying property, Siisiinen says.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and police prepared to get pig shit on them.
The firefighters strike lasted three months in 1998.
There were also spectacular strikes by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
1970s metal and electric varnishes
The most significant strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men participated in the metal men's strike.
The strike was suspended by a proposal from the Reconciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise.
The spring 1977 power strike lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people gathered in front of the Parliament House, many who made the recession unemployed, to demonstrate for work.
Firefighters strike for three months in 1998
The firefighter strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
Police were caught in egg rain as farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers climbed tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and burn hay bales in front of the meeting place.
Nurses striked in 1983 and 1995
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
They had last been on strike in 1983.
The 1995 strike was colored by a few deaths during the strike.
Tehy threatened to strike and mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass dismissal eventually accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors Striked in 2001
"Doctors on strike - by necessity," was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by municipal health centre and hospital doctors lasted about five months and sparked a lively debate on how strikes can endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the Move in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student financial aid in Helsinki from Senate Square to the Parliament House in 2013.
National Bureau of Investigation finds out the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police
Austrian police have asked the National Bureau of Investigation for help in resolving the background of a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck in Aisterheim near the German border carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Those on board the cold truck were all in good shape.
We have had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies at the scene in Austria, says Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the National Bureau of Investigation.
At the end of August, other refugees travelling in Austria on board a truck were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by choking.
According to Yleisradio, which first reported on cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited liability company.
The company carries out restaurant operations, among other things, and its CEO is a man with foreign background, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for human trafficking in Austria.
Captain beating up refugees, former drug courier and a deep-rich businessman - the story of five smugglers
A deep-rich king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a style-conscious missionary, and a taxi driver who considers himself a good guy.
For example, such people engage in human trafficking into the European Union.
Member Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death's Travel Agency, written by them, will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present tentacles of human smuggling, present suggestions for solutions, and introduce smugglers from different steps in the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them up right away.
The Kerkenna Islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for summer celebrations.
In terms of location, the islands are also ideal for smuggling, as the distance to Lampedusa Island, which is part of Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
By comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain in the chain and father of six.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it is more productive for a fisherman to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with his blue, ten-metre wooden boat hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
For one trip, Emir will earn about 8,000 euros after the expenses.
Emir has five assistants looking for him clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
The situation then calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers barely survive.
Accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer runs out of money, that's their problem.
We'll go out at midnight with passed-out lanterns.
The first night, we drive off the islands, then stop, wait for the day and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir is going on a return journey.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the troublemakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police once stunned him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed clients one by one from the neck and threw them overboard," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from south of the Sahara.
They say he's got to abuse his countrymen for this.
I'll beat them up right away.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Just a regular taxi driver
Goran is a regular taxi driver in Bogovaða, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is pulling its last and it has seen its best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi moves in general and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village with 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers southwest of Belgrade.
Next to the village is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men travelling without their family stay in tents, lean-tos and abandoned cars, which is now what anyone has managed to find or build.
Families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not submitted an asylum application to Serbia.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and weeks of walking in difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When they finally arrive in the Bogovaða area, a large hub for human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's rides are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say their thing once and that's enough," Goran praises.
He said Africans are trying to compromise.
Goran doesn't like that.
Silly silly all the way.
First, for example, a price of 300 euros is agreed, then they count it to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I just do my job and help people," he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only 50 euros per person for a ride to the Hungarian border.
The distance is about 200 kilometers, most of it comfortably on the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three- or four-fold price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcuts and takes his ride a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and cheers away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary and is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers fleeing the Congo visit, as well as a small center to help Congolese child refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It is important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of white underwear peeks elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, off-road car and three motorcycles.
When the Missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will initially call one of the Missionary's five phone numbers.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money nicely, and collapsing among the peddlers who cross the border.
To obtain the status of asylum seeker or refugee, Ugandan authorities must be told that they are from war zones in northern Kivu, for example, and that they have been forced to flee their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the customer.
The old ID will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
It helps the Missionary's contacts with Ugandan police.
The customer is then directed to the same place where even the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
He charges each step separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents to a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros, and moving the process to a European country, for example, 4,500-7,000 euros.
Folio and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, a former drug courier.
An Irishman in his 40s is on call off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know they are in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near downtown Calais.
They're driving a freeway A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If police stopped the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for arranging illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that, he's been sitting for seven years for drugs.
Taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across the freeway to a rest place where drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck - it must be ensured that it is on its way to England and not Holland, for example - and cuts across the protective cover safety wire.
It must be done quietly so that the drivers do not wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved in the plot, but then the action is more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom wraps his customers in aluminum foil, the same one that is wrapped around a fry or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should stop the police heat scanner from noticing the hider.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the scene, hoping the driver won't rush the salaminators at least before Britain.
King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
From Uppoika, the Turk has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean invasions, who controls sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has been constantly developing new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he demands the money only when he gets there.
One of the new methods is a luxury ship scam: a yacht is rented from Turkish ports to take American or European families on nice few days of tourist cruises.
In reality, ships are loaded into crowded Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul by land to a port and then by sea to Europe for a fee of between €5,000 and €7,000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial halls, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuffed into minibuses and driven somewhere on the coast.
They are told to hide among vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, the ship must be boarded quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under deck.
The Coast Guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about 53,000 euros for one luxury ship trip after expenses.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other smaller makers to do the work for him.
During the summer season, at least hundreds of transports are held and Küçük earns millions.
He is thought to have bought land, a pharmaceutical company and more than 100 apartments through cover companies that he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he appears to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16 September 2015 at 3:10 p.m.: The Death Travel Agency book will be published this week, not next.
American Olympic runner tells of his illness and becoming a prostitute
The new book by 1,500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton, who competed three times in the Olympics, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, talks about ending his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the games in top shape and ran the second best time in the qualifiers.
In the final, however, he panicked.
He rushed to the top from the very beginning and defended his leadership position in the manic race.
150 meters before the goal, however, his strength ran out.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and other rivals passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and thought I would never run again.
I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt tremendous pressure for success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with foreign men.
She also convinced her husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's rate was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations for becoming a prostitute was also that he needed adrenaline spikes similar to those he had received while competing in athletics.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The double life of a former star runner was revealed in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1st in the world at 1500 metres at 3.57.40, but was last in the Sydney Olympic Final.
World champion rejoiced when union put Norwegian ski rooster in check: "Direct back"
Petter Northug, the Norwegian ski king, has crossed the limits of propriety in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the athlete's contract all summer and autumn as last year.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multiple world champion and Olympic champion either.
As a result of the contractual dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup for the upcoming season.
The decision was praised by double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union put the ski rooster under control.
"Thank you for pointing at the spine," Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would apparently like to be part of the season on the national team so he could promote his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that will also take care of future generations, and would not let one athlete solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released his own press release on Tuesday, affirming that he wanted to play sports in Norwegian colours next season in the World Cup as well as then in the World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six World Cup medals in total, including two gold medals.
He was a member of a team that won message gold in Falun last winter.
Baking Translators' Shield Day is also celebrated in Ostrobothnia
On Shield Day 25 September, events will be held in various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Baking Translators Shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high-quality food expertise and lower the threshold for leaving for the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, the aim is to remind that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, but top restaurants inspected and classified by an impartial operator can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of shield restaurants and the organization.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in restaurant Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, the Old Town Restaurant participates in the shield day.
The event has also received significant attention internationally.
The event has been decided to be made one of the most significant international events in the organization, which will take place on the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki magazine: The establishment of Kauhava reception centre carried to the Attorney General
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre in the premises of the former Kauhava garrison currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure of crisis time, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, i.e. Suomen Erillisverkkot Oy.
Kauhajoki magazine says that, according to a private individual, placing a reception centre in the same building entity would pose a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Air War School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the magazine writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held for the past two years on the organisation of flight training and the arrival of a potential foreign operator at the airport.
This has been discussed with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Arto Rädy, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Defence.
The private person states to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of fundamental opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former garrison area is wrong.
The City Board of Kauhava discussed the reception centre issue last Monday.
Niinistö: Syria's situation reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
Management means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinistö comments to journalists at the evening after meeting the chairmen of all parliamentary parties at his official residence in Mäntyniemi.
The president said concern about managing the refugee situation brought all participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the ultimate issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we are facing major challenges
According to Niinistö, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, the Baltic Sea region.
Niinistö is hopeful of the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia will be able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and further tension over the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinistö, the NATO issue was also touched on in discussions.
The president did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Alkot closes for a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursday and 15 Friday.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the aim is to perform the operations of the airports during the work stoppage by the supervisors.
However, congestion and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
Demonstration closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
The demonstration on Friday will close the streets of the centre of Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Square will be closed to cars around 9:30-14 a.m.
From the direction of Mannerheimintie, no cars are allowed towards Kaivokatu, Postikatu or Töölönlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
From Unioninkatu in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is directed to Unioninkatu at the Kaisaniemi roundabout.
Police say the closing time depends on the population involved in the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed into the area.
Metro and tram drivers throughout Friday's demonstration
Metro and tram drivers participate in Friday's demonstration from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
The Association of Tram and Metro Staff told STT about it in the evening.
Most of the beginnings close for two hours, including mails closed
Friday's demonstration also causes disruption to Posti's services.
Significant delays are expected for the distribution of day mail, among other things.
Most of the postal service points are closed.
The blood transports of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the strike.
Meal transports, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples, are also sought.
Situational information on services is available on Posti's website.
Most of the Finnish Alkos will close their doors for two hours on Friday.
The Service Trade Union Pam has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 a.m.
Pam has also urged grocery workers to participate in a protest by trade unions.
SOK and Kesko representatives tell Helsingin Sanomat that the aim is to keep the stores open by supervisor if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information yet on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
Helsinki day care centres will not operate to their full extent on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency reports.
Due to a demonstration by trade unions, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres and club activities in day care centres and playgrounds are not organised.
24-hour day care centres and groups of children with intellectual disabilities and multiple disabilities remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for mentally disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The Early Childhood Education Agency promises to inform more about changes in operations tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, a wide range of channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in Parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often repeated the way the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches become.
According to Sipilä, speeches may not always be broadcast on Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let's see.
This channel is now being used tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio speech be given to citizens.
This dossier, which is now being talked about, is quite complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also watch it in Yle Arena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's television speech will not tell of a more general government turning inward.
Is the aim to take the right to define public debate more strictly into one's own hands and refuse to ask questions about public debate? ponders Professor Anu Koivunen of the University of Stockholm.
Reminds me of the recent comment by Secretary of State (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues will not be related.
Koivunen understands that commercial media is indignant about Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy makers are not reporting issues in a democracy.
It is the job of the media representatives, by definition, to try not to take the agendas of politicians as given.
According to Koivunen, television speech is a big risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for speech.
Is there more available today that we have already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there is only more of the same old, one must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in this sense, if it is not a specific situation but a routine speech among others.
There is a risk that Yle will be branded as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in Yle's interests or general line.
A clever bet from the wing
In the forthcoming speech of Sipilä, what the Prime Minister is not saying is also important, the media researcher emphasises.
In the evening, you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what it is not, says Heikki Kuutti, Research Coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to Kuut, TV speech is a clever move from Sipilä, because this allows him to bring his own view out without gravel sounds.
This will give the message a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike a news conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sipilä bypasses the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a risk that the media will misinterpret something about the speech because more specific questions will not be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV - whether sweat is dripping, whether the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipila to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do his thing well, it can work.
The situation is different from if the government were to inform about something, because here it is as if a person is speaking directly to another person.
This is what Obama and his partners regularly do.
Really exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be truly exceptional for the citizens.
He said that there has been no such thing in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wants to make Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
Employees' organisations will hold a demonstration and strikes against government action on Friday.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, says on Twitter that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne (sd.) announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
This is no time for monologues.
Soon six months after the election.
You can't hide endlessly," Rinne wrote on Twitter.
9-year-old boy on run has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of discovery.
POIKA HAS FOUND AND WHEN, the boy's father updated to his Facebook page.
The Internal Finland Police Department also confirms the matter to Iltalehti.
The boy went out to play at 4:00 in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Dad thanks everyone who helped with the search.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time
Finnish UFC star disappointed with young people's violent fad: You'll cause anger
Makwan Amirkhani, a Kurdish-based free fighter, posted a video on Facebook that appeals specifically to young people with immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani gave a weighty speech against young street fights.
Amirkhani, born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, has won both of his professional matches in the most prestigious UFC series so far.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to view an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account, where young people fight with extreme violence.
Amirkhani says he is disappointed with the fad of the young.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
Guys kick those on the ground, sit on the other, and punch indiscriminately without thinking about any of these consequences that this will have when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people seen in the videos are of immigrant background.
According to Helsinki Police Inspector Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and young people from native Finland.
It is precisely that you fight in general on the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turku-based Amirkhani reminds.
Amirkhani reminds that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been a lot of these isolated cases.
A little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be guests here for quite a while.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here," Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get subjected to some racism, you're going to have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with one of those, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You guys are making me hate that I don't like myself.
You have things pretty bad anyway and you won't improve them at all," Amirkhani concludes.
SAK pledges its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly says on Twitter that the employee organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK's proposal on Twitter.
The staff centre organisation STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder believes that the Board will approve the proposal if SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation SAK soften its previous position.
SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly, on the other hand, commented on the matter with little words on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will deal with the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock", and that instead of coercive laws, contracts made by active parties are needed.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's government's proposal for a social contract was not good enough for SAK.
Sipilä previously cut off negotiations on a social contract when SAK refused to commit to the target of a 5% productivity leap.
Comment: A big demonstration threatens to slumber - "It feels a little funny to wear a fist"
It feels a bit funny to wear a fist, if there is already a reconciliation paper in your pocket," writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The moods vary in the employee camp from side to side.
Is the government to be called down or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK federal leaders blew holy hatred of the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with being caught.
The threat spread to the Akava people as well.
The teachers' trade union OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no schools or daycare centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), the chairman of the staff member centre organisation STTK, performed conciliatoryly.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and was drafting an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity leap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre).
Akava chairman Sture Fjäder (kok) immediately rushed to announce that his compromise paper is already complete.
At first, there was no yard from SAK's office.
Chairman Lauri Lyly (sd) is difficult to reconcile when the federal leaders just Monday told him to put the country up on Friday.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAK Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK will seek solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for a joint proposal by employees to emerge, SAK should tend to accept a 5% productivity leap as a target.
It is no wonder that Palola's STTK has relations with Sipilä's Board of Directors.
Jukka Ohanus, Director of Social Influence at STTK, previously served as a special assistant to the Prime Ministers of the Centre Party, Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described the government's trade union expertise as having improved all the time.
Coincidence or not, but Palola's exit took a little bit of a boost away from the Finnish stoppers, with Marko Piirainen (sd) from the ACP as their frontman.
It feels a little funny to wear a fist if you already have a reconciliation paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lyly's comments.
Russia calls Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, criticized the OSCE meeting in Helsinki.
Sergei Naryshkin, Speaker of the Russian Duma, believes that Mongolia is a better OSCE host than Finland.
The fall session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has begun in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's capital, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July jubilee meeting in Helsinki.
At that time, Finland did not allow Russian politicians on the European Union's sanctions list, such as Naryshkin, to attend the meeting - a matter on which the President could remind journalists.
We estimate that it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to Interfax news agency.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU, but also at the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
The sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation reached Mongolia without any complications, so Naryshkin continued to spike Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organization".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with positive results - unlike the meeting that took place in Helsinki in July.
Mongolian leadership understands that parliamentary dialogue is not supposed to have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who is leading the meeting in Bator, Ulan, and who has already discussed with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
Lock meets real playoff troll: "Paints tight"
The killer and the lock continue bull days in Hakametsä today, as both are on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti anticipates that there will be no real paint parties in Hakametsä today.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to reverberate a 3-2-continuation victory over KalPa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver group was at its worst from a two-goal losing position.
The lock's Tuesday was more minor-winning.
The Blues, which had started with a tangled catch, had round zero points as a guest, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock attacker Janne Lahti anticipates setups on the club's website.
The killer has become quite a playoff nightmare for the Raumans.
The killer has just dropped from the Lock final series in the previous two seasons.
Both times, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Lock took the series to a break in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in the next three alongside and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for goalkeepers.
The cashiers who rejected both yesterday will get a flute shift today.
With the goal of the killer, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhunen, and between the Lock poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Perspective: A lousy play running in the Ace
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel to head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself starred.
The underdog sensationally struggled with heavyweight world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky had great sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's premiere, Mika Toivola wrote a restless Cinderella story in Pori.
The anonymous and wood-handed stew progressed to everyone's astonishment in the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was a White Indian, Pori Matt and Pele from Pelto.
In the playoffs, players dyed their heads red and cut the Iroquois.
Toivola became blonde.
The great TV commentator JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
Aces took the silver they won.
Toivola was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season's novel works in the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for the Aces has built a potaka on bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting guys in a trough like Rocky pig carcasses in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäki, Mikko Viitanen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Copperinen are credited with something other than disc playing.
Toivola has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the lead role is played by Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Iron Rock into Sean Connery.
Iron Rock is as clumsy as Connery would have been in the 1976 original work in Rocky, written by Toivola.
There's no Rocky in the Iron Rock other than a nickname.
Iron Rock's game philosophy does not include rushing and little pigging.
He appreciates hard play, but it's one thing to play hard as a pig.
Last season, Ässie's Garrett Stafford tackled Tappara from Jere Karelia to the head.
He received 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Rock put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve to.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the ace puck, Iron Rock, which was hot, snarled after the game to the People of Satakunta.
The Aces' team this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, police officers, and healers.
There are practically no key men in the best age.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill gap.
How much have you been able to influence player purchases, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was quite limited," Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a smoldering under the surface.
The 1953 Iron Rock is reportedly interested in moving to Toivola as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the Aces in the three league games of the season is equal to many losses in the goal difference of 1-6.
Toivola should not have written the sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays her husband for the first time.
Yes, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple has worked together a lot before, but now Olga is acting under Tuukka's guidance for the first time.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells about the early years of Apulanna, is the mother of drummer Sipe Santapuk, Sirkka.
Sirkka cheers up and supports his son, although his father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I have become familiar with my true role model, the easier it seems to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuukka for trusting me for the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have converged a lot.
They've met, spoken on the phone, and communicated.
The cricket has helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of their history from different angles.
Fortunately, the cricket also understands that drama is drama and the truth may need to be colored a little.
Olga emphasises that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanna would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and it was really dreary.
There was a rather low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about her youth even before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have been a little different at times.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were up to.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola's infamous skater.
Olga was an everyday and kind girl who had nothing to do with the film Tuuka.
At most, he could have secretly fallen in love.
According to Olga, he has worked so much with Tuuka in the last 10 years that a big project together is not scary.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team is going to Heinola for a month.
However, a couple living in Iit often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're taking over all of Heinola for a month.
They have welcomed us very warmly, just asking which streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 becomes the most expensive play film in Finland
The Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
Filming will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to the science fiction film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become Finland's most expensive play film ever with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation that is being done will also rise past Iron Sky 2, as the film has a budget of over 100 million euros.
Filming directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa will begin in October near Antwerp at AED Studios and last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium as early as next week.
The giant budget is not scary.
I've been sickly relaxed!
I have such a relaxed feeling about the script because I know exactly what the movie should be like.
Everyone in the team seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I am more excited and can't wait to show this movie to the audience," he told Iltalehti.
Originally, the film had a budget of 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
The budget is big, but it's a big stori.
However, 100 million could be stuffed into the film, because every angle of view and effects are so expensive.
Now everything is twisted so tight that it's not loose at all.
The film's production company Iron Sky Universe launched a crowdfunding campaign and bond on Wednesday, which pays an annual interest rate of 4-8 percent.
The final interest rate is determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
In two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trend setters' breasts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Until recently, a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs.
Advertising the brand of a hoodie or T-shirt was seen as somewhat hillbilly.
But times change.
Sportiness has become a real fashion megatrend, and so have old, familiar sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is fluctuating: if something is already really hillbilly, it starts to turn ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or tavisfashion, in which trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothes possible as if as a way to differentiate themselves from the mass.
Now, instead of the grey basic college, let's put on that sweatshirt buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which is the manufacturer's logo.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable stripe sweatpants, favorite team jerseys, and New York Yankees caps have also made a comeback to street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the underwear now flash the edge of the jeans are a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace's fall blouses makes it clear what brand of garment it is.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your dress?
Russian politician released evidence: I didn't get stuck in a tank hatch for hours!
It is claimed that a special incident occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In recent days, colorful claims have spread in Russian media that the Russian State of Emergency Ministry had to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peeking at the armored vehicle hatch in a pretty good mood and at least not based on those pictures, it's about any getting stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside the battle tank, it was the assault tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I have served in the Urals.
I went inside, looked around, and came out in peace," Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I really didn't spend five hours in that position," he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel that he admired Russia's new technology at the exhibition because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the carriage, I admired our technique.
And out I came through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next show, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the assault tanks," Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the journalist who wrote about it a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and roty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen," he told Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged stuck have been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the weapons show in a few days.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a Bloknot.ru case in which Zotov was reported to have struggled out of the tank hatch in an attempt and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he could not get out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their own views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But MP Zotov, due to his large size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he did not sit there for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky to Bloknot.

10 points about the effects of Friday stop on you - watch the video!
The trade union demonstration will be held at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm, but the strike will affect the lives of citizens for a much longer period of time - throughout the day and even beyond.
ISTV explained on 10 points how Friday stop affects citizens.
Watch the video to see the impact of work stoppages on road and rail transport - both in the transport of goods and passengers.
Air transport is a chapter of its own.
The strike action will badly overwhelm it, at least around noon, but the reflections will probably continue until Saturday.

There has been a leak at the Kittilä mine of the Canadian-owned mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
Purified process water from the gold mine has leaked from the so-called rich sand basin into a ditch.
The company said measures had been initiated to correct the leak.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water from the foaming process.
Usually, water is pumped either to be reused as process water or passed through a surface drainage field into the environment as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
The company says the quality of the leak water meets the current permit conditions.
No other material spilled into the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection tour on Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool dam structures.
The company says it will work closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs approximately six hundred permanent employees.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The country report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) largely follows the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland into comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contract system and unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamäki, there is agreement on structural reforms, but there are also minor differences.
There is a lot of sympathetic message to the government's actions in the IMF's assessment, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be overcut.
These include infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the financial messages.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates 0.4% economic growth for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9% next year.
In today's new business cycle forecast, Danske anticipates that growth will be on zeros this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the latest findings as a basis.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total output was growing slightly in the summer, Kuoppamäki says.
On the other hand, less attention may have been paid to the weakened confidence in industry or other so-called softer meters.
However, the differences are only a few percent decimals.
Nintendo appoints new leader
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start working on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a successful Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that was raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to track Iwata's footprints, according to Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is to involve Nintendo heavily in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the traditional game consoles side.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that as many as hundreds of children who have entered the country are missing each year.
Hundreds of minor applicants are missing each year, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, on their website SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
Juha Kannelmaa, Senior Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will disappear "under land" per year?- In 2013, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland for minors who came alone.
9 of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
The reason for the disappearance may be that it is clear in the proceedings that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue to deal with the matter in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for examining the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another member state.
In 2014, there were 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were closed because the applicant had likely moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared in the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number increasing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications for minors who have come alone.
There are no total statistics on missing minor asylum seekers this year, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he emphasises.
What about those who have made a conversion decision?
For example, do they also disappear into the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, Kannelma emphasises.
Interior Minister Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered candidates in the country.
He has taken action on this.
At the EU Interior Ministerial Conference, Orpo, who considered refugee issues, announced on Monday practical measures to bring the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland under control.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see photos of equipment
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkonen, a pioneer in the media sector who lost his ability to work due to illness attacks, is now on sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which was once one of the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
The online advert was first reported by the online magazine Iltamacasini.
Today, much of the equipment has been left at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, television shows for Betacam tapes are no longer filmed.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the hardware is no longer up-to-date in that way, but these too will be needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen ponders to IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkonen is trying to move out of his current Myrskylän home.
There's no way we can take all the stuff with us.
I have slowly started to inventory and see what stuff is being abandoned.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV and radio equipment.
After a recent stroke, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will not return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that only goods and equipment are sold now.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen's actual life's work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up boxes of films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic threatens to porridge worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to expand the force action in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only for the duration of the Friday demonstration.
In the afternoon, it will be determined whether traffic will stop all day.
Pekka Hirvonen, the chief shop steward, says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and shift cuts badly sting drivers, so government plans to cut supplements raise opposition.
Hirvonen thinks that seizing traffic throughout the day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Friday, public transport is virtually completely stagnant in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.
According to VR data, trains do not run between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
No local or long-distance traffic will move on Friday.
Trains that left before 6 a.m. are driven to the destination stations.
According to HSL data, most buses remain in the pit.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning three to Saturday morning at three o'clock.
Probably a small number of buses can be run, they are run by supervisors," HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo says.
Repo says HSL cannot say exactly which bus services will run on Friday.
The employee organisations will organise a major demonstration at Helsinki Railway Square on Friday from 11 am to 1 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward with Europe, reports the AP.
Sky News reports that refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
Local media also said Hungarian police had used water cannons against people.
Muslim boy arrested at school in Texas, teacher thinks self-made bell was a bomb
In Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought the self-made watch he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to showcase the proceeds of his electronics hobby.
One of the teachers, however, thought the clock looked like a bomb.
Police were called in, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being handcuffed to the youth detention cell.
Mohamed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the watch.
Yet it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a fake bomb.
Mohamed said police had said the watch looked like a "film bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it reportedly consisted of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamedia was punished with three days of forced leave from school.
His father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council wonders if the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is buzzing - Labour leader refused to sing national anthem
In the song, God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been shared by Corbyn's own Labour Party MPs.
This has offended the people," Labour MP Kate Green said in a radio interview with the BBC.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots' fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In an official statement, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect to pilots by attending the event.
We are all indebted to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement emphasized.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided Labour's ranks.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear him will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity measures and the increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear today for the first time as a party leader in parliament during Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what to ask Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, financial security and the security of our families," the Prime Minister tweeted in his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family killing still unclear - the family father was facing a lawsuit
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family killing in Greenwood, Minnesota for a week.
A family of five were found dead in their home on September 10 and a couple of days later police confirmed that the shooter was Brian Scott Short, the father of the family, 45.
After first shooting a shotgun at his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after concern about the absence of children at the school.
Based on this announcement, police went to the house for a check-up and found the Short family dead all over the house.
StarTribune says it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million House and Successful Business
The investigation into the case of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for blood acts is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and had created his fortune on the social media site AllNurses.com for nurses.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short reported that the site has four million different visitors weekly.
I have made 50 bids for the company in the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was reflected in Short's family buying a huge house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million.
The house is advertised as a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
Trial pending
StarTribune said the family's father was facing a lawsuit.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers various prep courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's site had not removed any blasphemous comments from the prep courses, and thus had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner three were awarded the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month award at the race event.
This is great," Loiri commented cheerfully on his honor board.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned 100,000 euros.
Artist legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Success horse coach Korpi gets Loir involved in full peace of work while working with the horse.
Pekka determines and decides where to take the horse to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
NHL star's stunning gesture - "The greatest athlete ever made a donation"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about €6.7 million) to Montreal Children's Hospital.
The hospital reports that this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital with other fundraising for the next seven years.
Subban signed a contract with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual earnings.
As a reward for his donation, Subban receives a lobby space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals significantly in the past.
Long-time captain Jean Beliveau, who died a year ago, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge amount of money for another major hospital in the city to get the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
Japanese cafe can be ordered for wife's evening - serves food with bikini and apron only
Theme cafes are a tough thing in Japan.
There is already a goat café, a rabbit café, a vampire café, a hug cafe and now a wife café on the market.
It strikes the lonely, the social and the hungry.
This was reported by Metro.
From the Ore no Yome café in Tokyo, you can order a wife or husband for the evening.
It is a waitress who pretends to be the customer's spouse.
"Half" is selected from the list before entering the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just up against the apron and bikini, while the husband is on tight cycling shorts.
The website provides all the information about the length and weight of the wife candidates, always to the type of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: attacks against car security began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the field," a statement released by Intel said.
The Board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
ASRB researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections to standardize best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel announced the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will update the report based on ASRB's research results in the future.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in circulation will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate is that 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," said Chris Young, Intel Security director.
ASRB allows Intel to establish safety best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is a major ingredient in the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
Ford Focus RS costs around 52,000 euros in Finland!
Ford's Focus RS has been expected to rise like a moon for years.
Finally, the car is also beginning to be in sight in Finland.
Ford has released RS data now that the car world is looking at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Ford's new four-wheel drive RS accelerates in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour thanks to its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine.
The price is also interesting for Finns, tentatively it is reported to be 52,000 euros.
The car is already available for order, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in a statement.
Kia introduced two new features at Frankfurt Motor Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
The new fourth generation Sportage is certainly more important than the two innovations in Finland, with which Kia plans to grab a larger slice of the ever-growing SUV market.
Created under the leadership of Gregory Guillaume, the new European Director of Design, Sportage is rounder than before.
The wheelbase and exterior dimensions have become a centimeter here and there and the car is splitting the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is broadly unchanged, but a 1.6-litre turbo with 177 horsepower has been added.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to coming to sale.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the turn of the year, the new Kia Optimat will reach our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia plans to conquer the hearts of upper middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher standards of equipment.
Optimos with 1.7-litre turbodiesel and 2.0-litre petrol engine are added.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate as Optima GT with a 2.0-litre turbo engine arrives alongside them.
Around the same time as its arrival, the sale of Optima Farmer begins.
Chisu returned to the stage - blazing in a bold overall outfit
Singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric blue pants suit has a spectacular, open neckline.
The outfit beautifully introduces the waist of the singer star's graceful.
The whole is crowned by a golden metal belt and red lipstick.
The singer, who became a mother during the three-year break, has lost her pregnancy pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be a year old.
The singer released her first single from a new album in August.
Getting back on stage and getting in front of the general public after a long break is not really exciting for me.
I have missed all the music-related activities, the singer says.
Chisu will release his new and fourth album, Polaris, in a couple of weeks.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style amazes again - now you can see the breast
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives one topic after another.
She readily presents her pregnancy stomach and breast equipment in sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m. American time when she and her sister Kourtney Kardashian left husband Kanye West's gig.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the breast.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress when the flashlights flicker.
Last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-like maternity costume, she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a couple of days ago.
The accessory was highlighted by black overgenerational boots.
The third special maternity costume is as fresh as last Friday of the week, when there was a pregnancy stomach on the show.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, the competition is terrible
Manon Leloup, the top model, wanted to correct the notion that the model world was pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk their mouths out of the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if you have posed in top designers' outfits the previous season, the new season will start with castings again.
And every season, new, fresh faces come into the industry, competing for work with veterans.
Models rarely have places they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and it can take a year to stay in a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearablely difficult.
New York and Paris are the most sought-after jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There is not just one type of thinness.
Agent in New York may ask for pounds to drop, but in Paris, they'll say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
During Fashion Weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and at the same time serve as a support network.
When fashion weeks end, the difference is sad.
Models want to be in this industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are gnawed by the fact that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they are actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
Models yesterday at the Tory Burch show.
New York City is currently celebrating fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their collection next year.
Scrooge Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unknown Apulanta musician in the film
Scrooge Salminen plays the band's founding member Antti Lautala in the film based on the early years of Apulanta.
Lautala founded Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtanen, but left the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a rap artist who's almost 26 years old, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoot because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I'm only learning his playing style from video.
I don't want to make impressions of a person.
The man piloting Scrooge Salminen and Dogs does not go into the role.
Punk manneris come naturally with the man.
In the punk episode of Stars, Stars, many certainly saw a foretaste, as well as if they have ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but always goes full-on.
The main actors in the film You Made Us Beautiful, directed by Tuukka Temonen, who played bass in Apulanta from 1993 to 2004, were announced today.
The core group, which has become familiar to the band's audience, is performed by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukki is performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Scrooge Salminen gave a tip about his upcoming job last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Scrooge has already posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he has had to implement for the film.
Previously seen in mustache and chin beard, Scrooge has shaved his face smooth-posque, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: How to tell children about refugees
Many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking to reach Europe in recent days.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue to be raised, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Smaller children are worth protecting, and not, for example, letting them watch the news alone.
Young children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and be distressed, he says.
However, if a child has come across television news photos of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth bringing it up.
It is good to have a conversation about the child's starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
The child's fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones the parent thinks he is afraid of.
It is not worth scaring the child in vain, even if you are distressing and scaring yourself.
A smaller child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will feel safe as well.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
It is good for parents to bring it up with them if you are wondering about the child.
The fact is that not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents, together with children, can think about how this is viewed in our family.
But do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place after all?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand: If you also talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
Own powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent for your child
Ball flash that strikes the blood difficult to control
Perttu Pohjola was able to grind Apila's Ball Lightning into a heavy blow in midsummer.
It only ran out of profits and second places until at the end of July, a collapse came in the Tampere ranks.
Since the stallion was thoroughly clotted, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a time for his protégé from the vet.
The explanation for the shutdown was found in the lookout.
The horse had laryngitis.
The disease was not the mildest in the head, but required two courses of medicine to overcome it.
Since Apila's Ball Lightning had to be on light exercise, Pohjola says he is positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE mare in Turku after Taruntuuli.
Apila's Ball Lightning was very under pressure from the break, having been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
Given those things, a small tendency at the end was understandable, Pohjola says.
Coach assumes that a good competition made the stallion a blade.
The horse's tune certainly went on from there, and hopefully it would have leveled off as well.
Apila's Ball Lightning has been a so-called humor horse.
When you haven't amused it, it could have been thrown fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the stallion has been detached from the stallion by such lightning that opponents have been amazed.
In short speed, fellow competitors cannot cope with the Ball Flash, which even sheds warm-blooded rides.
In Vermo, there is a nest run in the Nordic region's wishes.
The other thing is how Apila's Ball Lightning agrees to it.
It's pretty hard at the time of departure and might even be a bunch under the boom in the departure car and stuff like that.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.
Apila's Ball Lightning is also able to come from the bow while in order, and we're going to drive it for a win, the coach promises.
This is why you can't get rid of unnecessary iPhone programs
Apple CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may be able to be removed sometime in the future - but not quite all.
Apple plans to remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, said Tim Cook, the company's CEO, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone has a set of programs that are relatively few to use: For example, FaceTime calls, Magazine kiosk, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a forced update to iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some apps are linked to someone else on iPhone.
If removed, it could cause problems somewhere else on the phone," Cook told Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
Cook says Apple is investigating, as the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhones.
Eurozone inflation waned to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, or 0.1% year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised its 0.2% estimate slightly downwards a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rates were 0.2%.
So-called bottom inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for core inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy was 7.2% cheaper in the euro area last month than it was a year ago.
In the EU-28 as a whole, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest consumer prices in the euro area, or 1.4 per cent, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest with prices falling by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus-marked according to the EU Harmonised Price Index.
Eurozone inflation remains persistently far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target of 2% price increases in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will pick up to 1.1%, the central bank predicts in its new inflation forecasts announced in early September.
US Fed next tries to tighten monetary policy
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more securely within three years after the country's central bank, the Fed, begins to raise its interest rates again for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the decline begins before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it may start raising interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next recession can push on top at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate rhythm before that.
Or at least that's what happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work as they used to - and if they react to the tightening of the Fed's money taps as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large customers last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not think they know when exactly the Fed will start raising its interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use their cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at which key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates - and what may result.
It becomes clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a more shaky condition to withstand interest rates rising than at any time before since the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year
Leaders who decide on the Fed's monetary policy and its current stance have hinted throughout last summer and early autumn that the time is beginning to be ripe for raising interest rates.
The first interest rate increase in over nine years may come as early as this week.
The matter will be resolved during Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter for its two-day meeting.
The last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering rate was in June 2006.
At that time, a series of relatively regular but at a time small 0.25 percentage points interest rates ended, with which the Fed raised its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
Financial market symptoms began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis ruptured into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession came in 2009.
Last time, serious adversities in financial markets and the real economy began at a slower pace than has typically happened since previous Fed interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and harsher than at any time since the recession of the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategists have screened the rise and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the transformations of financial markets since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
The Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impact are being reported since the 1950s.
It has been less than a year since the first rate increase began, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The exchange rate increase in financial markets has ended within one year and two of the start of the Fed interest rate increases.
The Fed has alternately raised and alternately lowered its key interest rate by a dozen cycles of different lengths since the early 1950s.
Each time has differed in some respects from the others, and the narrator is relatively scarce in the review, so they hardly allow you to conclude anything certain about the effects of the next interest rates.
Strategies point out that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis, let alone the culprits, may not be unquestionably discovered even by decades of research.
But three points about the reasons that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power are probably somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their key interest rates too low in the 21st century for too long.
They patched up the marks of a techno bubble, and at the same time grew the next one.
2) The amount of debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades and already too high increased even greater by the influence of central banks' excess monetary policy.
The largest debt bubble in economic history to date was born.
3) In particular, mad debt financing, which was packed in the financial economy with near restraint, inflated most aspects of financial markets the largest exchange bubbles in economic history up to that point, from shares to real estate, bonds and commodities.
Nor does it create a very harsh dispute that the financial markets that rose to heights on increasingly complex leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state as the Fed and other central banks last pushed interest rates up.
Financial structures set on debt leverage, let alone valuation bubbles, lasted only their time after interest rate increases had begun and the cost of debt financing had turned to an increase.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and were followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not guess what will happen next, but give a point of thought by mentioning such things as:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept their monetary policy stance even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower for even longer.
2) Debt has not been madly cheap for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now debt money is literally cheaper than free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now the debt burden is heavily heavier in different parts of the economy than before or before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has left central banks more transparent and cheaper than before has mostly remained in the financial markets and has subsided the key classes of securities and assets to the most expensive level since the peak before the financial crisis or ever.
And strategists not only flatten the atmosphere with warning signs from financial markets, but also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and decades from the heaviest recession to the model that has occurred in the past.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition but, accordingly, the pressures and risks of financial markets are incomparably greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed next begins to tighten its money taps tighter.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe Generalen strategist Albert Edwards is not as strange as it can seem.
He has been preparing the bank's international investor customers for the following translations of the Fed for a long time:
First the Fed raises interest rates, then financial bubbles break out, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to shut down financial fires with even larger QE money syringes.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a manufacturer of computers and printers, plans to cut up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed at HP's corporate service side, the company says.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focusing on corporate sales, and HP Inc., a company focusing on consumer PCs and printers, in November.
HP had its highest number of employees in 2011, when it had 350,000.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302,000.
The company records non-recurring expenses of $2.7 billion (approximately €2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
The Hewlett Packard Enterprise is reduced by 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The consumer side reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries with 60% of its employees in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers account for more than 10% of its operating profit.
The other year, its three most significant customers brought 65% of operating profit.

Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (Centre) has served as a member of the Board of Directors of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's operations involve so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based company Saltri II LuxCo, of which Berner was appointed a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the board.
Berner himself says he filed a resignation notice for membership in May this year.
I checked and it's enough that I've filed a resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place on an agreed schedule," Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upofloor in 2010-2013 and after the merger, on the Board of Directors of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings pass through a multi-step ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been a member of the Board of Directors of Karelia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was sought for the company, which was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my own job was to ensure that the benefits of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the proceeds of our Finnish companies' capital are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company do not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure erected in the tax haven is due to the fact that Kährs' largest owner, the private equity fund Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take on the first 100 residents as early as 6 p.m. today.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will establish a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue College.
The operations are maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is especially the production of health care and medical services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy jointly agreed on security arrangements for the centre, among other things.
STTK is preparing an alternative work-life blackmail package
STTK will begin preparing an alternative package for the government's tightening of working life.
The organization also hopes to include other employee centre organisations.
According to Chairman Antti Palola, the attention is currently on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative ways to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life continues after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization's administration meeting during a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, compared to 2,700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if the party has a terrible enthusiasm for having a conversation if you have one to 100 on the side.
Palola: Negotiation link has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication to Parliament about its own package and start preparing reforms.
Palola did not comment on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, the dialogue with the government exists and has been constructive to him all along.
According to Palola, the surgery of Sunday supplements is a painful place for the staff centre organisation STTK field in particular.
The organization requires the government to back down from the coercive legislation it would implement some of the blackmails.
According to Palola, the STTK does not warm up to the preparation of the alternative package with the SDP that has kept the issue on the agenda.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the work-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the pay for the first sick days is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
STTK stresses that central organizations have invited wage earners to the demonstration, and it has not been intended to organize the strike.
Akava Fjäder thanks
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder thanks STTK's announcement of the preparation of the alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now coming along with Akava, as Akava has long outlined an alternative model for government proposals.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without SAK the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava Chairman Sture Fjäder hopes that SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will join in preparing the proposal as an alternative to cuts.
Antti Palola's STTK said earlier Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working hours banks.
Akava announced on Wednesday that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the 5% competitiveness leap sought by the government as an alternative to cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all along, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to look at the terms of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be on Akava's lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that will be available to the government and employers of the country," Fjäder says.
Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to make a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, common coal, jolts" - play bingo while Sipilä talks in the evening
University of Tampere Green Left
The bingo coupon of the Green Left of the University of Tampere for the evening.
The prime ministers have previously given exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 9:05 p.m.
When applying for a similar Prime Minister's previous speech, it must go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister when he gave a famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then gave several radio speeches during the Winter and Continuation War.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of train performers with a television speech.
Single call, monarchist spirit
Sipilä's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what is to come.
Paavo Arhinmäki, president of the Left Alliance, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in Parliament as a prime minister's announcement, allowing the speech to be discussed as well."
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, "exclusive call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
Erkki Tuomioja of the SDP condemned on Facebook that "monarchist vibe: the Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it."
SDP Chairman Antti Rinne challenged Sipilä to dialogue: "Soon six months after the election.
Not a single appearance from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
Tried is.
What is @juhasipila afraid of?
Public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on live by SAK Chairman Lauri Lyly and EK CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Yle has been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered this and found that it is part of the public service mission to promote publicity covering the whole of Finland, in the news of Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of Yle's publications.
Like us in the time of the Tammelas
The speech has also sparked mockery.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed well in advance, the children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mom puts on the prettier den and Dad matches the tie around her neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be quieting down to the TV like we used to be in the time of Me Tammelas," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also tell in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital, who are drafting amnesty laws for their other tax evaders and at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has run out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is made by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has posted the following bingo on Facebook.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living in debt and team spirit tonight?
Coupons and pens ready, at 9:05 p.m. it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to overthrow Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected Russia's offer to power Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan for Assad to give way to power in style after a while.
However, the West did not take up the proposal because it believed that Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed a three-point plan for him in a one-on-one debate: the opposition was not to be armed, there was to be a speech connection between the opposition and Assad immediately, and the abdication of Assad had to be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree on all issues, but we are able to discuss openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment
Ahtisaari says he conveyed Thurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
Thurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion to the newspaper, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that Assad's forces had already committed several massacres at that time and key opposition groups refused all agreements with which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is hesitant about Ahtisaari's speeches because, in his experience, Russia was never ready to discuss the fate of Assad.
Russia has officially supported Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Thurkin spoke under Moscow authorization.
If he had told me about Thurkin's speeches, I would have replied that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that it was Putin's trick to keep power on some al-Assad supporter.
The refugee stream of our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill we caused ourselves," Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum Seekers' Settlement Centre in Tornio
The Government's asylum seekers' organizing centre, designed in Northern Finland, is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be established in a building in Tornio's joint session empty in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to better control the refugee flow from the Swedish border.
Helsingin Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the council had already decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), Vice-President of Tornio City Council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not together and some of the group wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates out of 43.
The organizing center was opposed by 13 delegates.
You could expect the decision to be positive, Hyöppinen says.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and the matter was reacted to quickly.
The joint session would accommodate an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would be functional in that sense too, Nousiainen says.
Sipilä still hopes for an alternative to blackmail in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre), halving the holiday money in public would only take care of part of the government's search for the price of labour.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations manage to agree on one.
Sipilä told reporters in Parliament that he has not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations were looking for compensatory means for the work-life extortion reported by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving the holiday money would be a resort, as it would target almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the planned cut in Sunday supplements by the government.
Labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holiday money, as they are recorded in collective agreements instead of law.
The Government will be reporting to Parliament on Wednesday next week on the tightening of working life as a Government communication.
According to Sipilä, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
The final deadline is not either.
Legislative work then starts, i.e. the train is on the move and it is getting harder and harder.
It's a good time.
It won't be long in such things, if there is a will, Sipilä said.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, converting Epiphany and Helatorstai into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working hours.
In addition, the pay for the first sick days is cut, overtime pay is halved, Sunday compensation is reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms will be implemented as coercive legislation past trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
Due to the actions, the Centre of Employees organisations will hold a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political strikes.
Tohmajärvi Council approves extension of Mahlahalli warehouse
The Tohmajärvi council unanimously but slightly approved the extension of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, or Mahlahalli warehouse.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than originally talked about.
There is also a busy schedule.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when the previous extension was decided.
At this point, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later in connection with the interim report.
There was still talk on the agenda of an investment of between EUR 150,000 and EUR 200,000, but at the meeting technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300,000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.) justified.
The Karelian language also has a place in Joensuu
The City Board relaxed its previous sharp position on bringing Karelian street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in terms of nurturing the Karelian tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu does not declare itself the capital of the Karelian language, because there are no historical grounds for it and the Karelian language is not an inherent part of the identity of the area.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern Savonian dialects.
Even after a new decision, there will be no Karelian street name signs in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is also ready for use in Karelian language, for example in information boards and tourism marketing, with good consideration on a case-by-case basis.
The same attitude is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth being open-minded about the use of Karelian language now that multiculturalism is living and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The Karelian language is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of the whole of Finland.
Both of them can be used well to benefit from the diverse marketing of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the vitality of the province
The cuts in train connections strike the vitality of the province with a hard hand.
Transport connections directly affect the region's business life and competitiveness.
And that affects whether there is any way to live and work here at all, says Kari Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu.
He also highlights air traffic, the continuation of which has also been in the report on several occasions.
It is important for the whole province that our chances are not reduced by government measures, as is happening now.
The effects of the closures of these transport connections should be considered, for example, for employment, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of transport connections poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Recruitment Manager, says that marketing the university towards Western Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are weak in the transverse direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
Of them, about 10-20% are from Uusimaa, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
Joensuu became one gravel sound for the Seu War
The Joensuu City Board's view of the regional Sion war project is seemingly unanimous, but there is one gravel sound among them.
Pentti Keskisalo (sd., pictured), a member of the City Board, proposed to abandon the entire project at the Board meeting on Monday, but his proposal lapsed unprofitable.
The Government approved the closing proposal of Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised in early October before the City Council meeting, which will issue a final statement on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train service from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
Passenger train services from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, although fewer than one pair of train services.
There will be changes in passenger train traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of train services is left out, but still five times a day you can get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The purchase money for train services by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will prepare new schedules by the end of the year.
They will come into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue department let a 12-year-old who climbed off the roof and could not get off the roof on his own.
The situation arose in Tornio hill, Ketotie, at half past six on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That didn't stop the crowd of boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of amateur radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, others slipped from the scene and passersby alerted the rescue services to help the last one on the roof safely return to the surface.
FedEx's net sales fluctuation, weaker outlook for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak result for the last quarter, leaving the transportation industry weakened its full-year profit forecast due to a decrease in demand for freight services and increased costs for land transport.
The company plans to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's share fell by about 2.5 percent 45 minutes before the actual trading opened on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is $10.40 to $10.90 for the financial year ending in May, down 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to a factSet study, analysts predicted $10.84.
The forecast has weakened despite an average price increase of 4.9%, with increases taking effect on January 4. Additional fees for land transport of heavy or large shipments will take effect in November.
The company is still waiting for profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenue and growth in e-commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has performed well in a weaker-than-expected economic situation, which has tested production and global trade in particular.
The plans for hiring seasonal workers were announced the day after competitor UPS announced plans to hire roughly the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, an increase of 6%.
The earnings per share were $2.42, so Zacks Investment Research's $12 analyst forecast was left behind.
Net sales rose five percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research said the revenue was expected to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international first-class shipments in recent years, which has led to the company's Express unit being stagnant.
The strong growth of e-commerce has strengthened FedEx Ground's performance.
Last quarter, land transport net sales increased by 29 per cent, but operating profit showed increased costs of large-scale shipments and insurance.
The Express unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the proceeds from the freight business decreased due to higher labor costs.
About an hour before the actual trade opened, FedEx's stock price had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended up with an 11% drop from the average for the year and 17% lower than the highest quotation recorded on June 11.
This week, the decision makers of the Federal Reserve meet for the most anticipated meeting in years, and the group sits down at an eight-metre-long Honduran wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
On the wall of the central bank's decorative, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the central bank's spokesman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the state's financial interest ahead of all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices here stable.
However, since the Great Depression, the central bank's leadership has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be the missing piece in terms of a tricky decision. On Thursday, the central bank is due to announce whether the US economy is ready to start weaning from the unpredictable stimulus that short interest rates that remained close to zero in the end of 2008 have provided.
While most data shows stable economic growth, recent financial market turmoil can lead already cautious central bank officials to scare the increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate — even in a percentage point quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are naturally the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I believe that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market is to give enough reason to wait yet," Piegza continues.
Those who have considered this do not agree with what the central bank intends, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of economists in a Bloomberg study were eroding the rise in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are thought to be waiting for the central bank, and the main indicator shows that there is only a 30% chance of withdrawal.
If the central bank raises its key interest rate, stock prices can fall unless the decision makers soften the impact by promising another withdrawal.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index defected 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16,599.85.
"The decline was driven by expectations that the central bank will keep the key interest rate stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest rates at this point," he said.
"If this were to happen, the central bank would have to think carefully about how to keep the hands of those in the financial markets without shaking."
Another expert said that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty about when the central bank will operate.
Just a month ago, the central bank seemed to be leaning to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in tightening financial conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has said throughout spring and early summer that he expected interest rates to be raised this year — despite the fact that liberals say economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, now at its lowest level in seven years and close to the level that the central bank is falling to full employment.
Wages seem to be picking up
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank's annual 2% targets, central bank decision-makers noted that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take into account the tight situation in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However , financial markets worldwide did not startle last month as China devalued its currency.
Dow Jones industrial average dropped by up to 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that China's economic decline would also affect global growth.
The market has picked up this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by nearly 10% from May's peak.
Market turmoil means that consideration of the increase in the key interest rate becomes even more complicated for central bank decision-makers.
"The work of the central bank is becoming more complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and what news has come from the weakening of China's economy in recent weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former central bank official.
Now he believes the central bank is waiting at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable data on the situation after recent developments in the Chinese economy," Oliner said.
The reorganisation of the global economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most influential entity in the world's monetary economy.
The central bank's impact has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, a mere hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could narrow the scope of its operations brought about up upheavals around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely intertwined, and in addition to monitoring world trends, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts to have a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process at the central bank is more art than science," Zachary Karabell, director of global strategy at fund management firm Envestnet Inc., said in a statement.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond Regional Central Bank said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that seem to have no connection to the pillars of the economy.
The voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Lacker, has called for an increase in the key interest rate, such as the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to lower the key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limited-identifiable sanctions were available for economic growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank overturned the decision.
"The central bank should only put monetary stability first in a major crisis, such as the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest turmoil doesn't even come closer to the situation at the time," he said.
"There is no need to fear raising interest rates because of the shock of the market," added Posen from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Until this becomes a change, I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves."

Brazilian Rio Grande Pediatric Association promotes proper diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association of Rio Grande Pediatricians SPRS has developed a blinding way to teach nursing women the importance of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-feeding with images of unhealthy food painted on them.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which allows the baby to get all the food he needs and develop a strong immune system.
Due to the extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
According to a new study, other changes in diet should be made in addition to increasing calorie intake.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, revealed that a pregnant woman's healthy diet can affect baby genes and protect the baby from tumor development.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise has the most viewers, although Nine tries to get the lead on her Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson thanked Canberra for making a morning show about the aftermath of the Liberal Party leader elections, which did not improve Today's ratings much.
The Nine channel morning program was broadcast from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The morning program of the competing channel, piloted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was broadcast from London, while special broadcasts of the program's week are also broadcast from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance apparently did not matter to Australian television viewers, as Sunrise was watched by an average of 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, while Today watched 339,000 viewers.
Today's ratings rose slightly compared to last Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but were left behind from last Thursday's reading (343,000).
Today has reached for the distance to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 spectators, Sunrise had 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 spectators.
In September, Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349,000 spectators and Today 314,000 spectators.
Here is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
The winds of change will have a greater impact on Parliament this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

Seven had an 800 Words new series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The novelty drama is about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children. The new series reached a staggering 1,219,000 spectators.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson would be enough to star the hit series alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's ratings, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven's The X Factor maintained its strong position with 1,136,000 spectators. The series clearly defeated The Block (838,000) and TBL's Families series (726,000).
Seven's The Chase Australia has captured viewers in varying degrees.
The first half hour of the new quiz series hosted by Andrew O'Keefe (17:00-17.30) was followed by an average of 446,000 spectators.
On the second half hour (17.30-18.00), the number of spectators rose to 623,000, which was as if it were more than Eddie McGuiren on the Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators in the first half, and the second half attracted a staggering 720,000 spectators.
Hot Seat had 620,000 spectators.
The Chase Australia's second night ratings showed Nine that Hot Seat will pass at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final trio really think Sam Wood is the Bachelor of Dreams — but who does the man choose?
Was the secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently revealed the choice of Bachelor of Dreams.
The final choice of the bachelor of dreams, Sam Wood, has been a closely guarded secret.
The three remaining women did not say a word about who received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked about the moods of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the trio is dropped away, and the women could inadvertently hint at who would become the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women exclaimed that Wood is the perfect man, and women praised the man's sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity, and considered him a partner with qualities that fit him.
When asked who would be the most suitable partner for Wood, if the last rose did not hit their own spot, their answers can give an indication of who will take the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markkoski quickly named Mackay the most suitable partner for Wood after themselves.
Everything has been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As soon as I came to the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam fit together well. This feeling has been preserved throughout the program," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has her feet on the ground, and she's really fun company," Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit, there's chemistry between them.
They seem like a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay said he realized on a hometown date last week that Wood could be the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not just a race. I am now investing in our relationship to the fullest," Mackay said.
When asked who Wood should choose if he did not choose her, Mackay was mysteriously answered:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, and Snezana and Lana are even."
Bachelor of Dreams on Ten channel on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne has several options for starting an NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne after she moved to the United States, and several other clubs also became interested in the man after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have kept Hayne on the bench, as he was in the ranks of the Australian rugby team. Hayne sparked the air kick return situation after the team took the win on Tuesday from Minnesota by 20-1.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man another chance to return the air kick, and the coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the dressing room after the game.
He did not rob newcomers in front of the rest of the team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is in the first quarter of the game against the Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and her Australian fan base had been waiting for the rest of the man from the NFL debut.
Hayne left the field, raining after the failure, and later told Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that she could not have imagined a worse start to her NFL career.
"These things happen, and we have to move on," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error to her debut in the State of Origin series in 2007 when her pitch in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
Overall, the experience was still incredible for a 27-year-old youth.
Hayne posted a photo on Instagram where she poses with fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested with a gun at an airport in Siberia.

Four dead after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people were killed in southern Nepal, a government source said on Wednesday, and police fired rubber bullets at the country's alleged new unconstitutional demonstration, including a four-year-old boy.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, less than three hundred kilometers from the capital Kathmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of whom threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that police used tear gas and fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but are generally considered a less destructive option, suddenly were so deadly.
This was the latest confrontation in weeks of protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe demands its own state.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent skirmishes since August 10,
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a significant step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the regime has been centralized for centuries.
The new constitution has been worked on since 2008, but legislators accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on constitutional clauses in Kathmandu this week, and authorities say the new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Center: 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde
A large low-pressure area about 560 km from the southernmost parts of Cape Verde Islands may be 60% likely to develop into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center of the United States announced Tuesday.
According to the Miami Meteorological Institute, there is also a clear low-pressure center in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antilles, and it can also develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days with a 60% probability.
Google plans to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the launch of a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian aid organizations that help thousands of people who have fled war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leadership, the campaign was launched by Google employee Rita Masoud by sharing her own experiences, who was only seven years old while fleeing Kabul with her family.
"We traveled in the dark by train and bus and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the escalation of the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe, many families in similar situations are in dire need of help.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children Association and the UN Refugee Agency.
Once donations have been collected through google.com/refugelief for $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, reaching a total of 11 million.
The refugee crisis in Europe is at its worst since World War II, particularly exacerbated by the four-year Syrian civil war, which has forced more than four million people to flee their homes this year.
The war will also have to be fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
A new study found that mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive surgery-free treatment.
"It takes time to get mortality data," said Robin Blackstone, a doctor of obesity surgery expert who discussed a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgeries have been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have concerned morbidly overweight individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 35.
BMI indicates weight and height with a normal value of 18.5 to 24.9.
When the BMI is over 25, the person is overweight, and the BMI of over 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can calculate your own BMI at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two obesity surgery methods, gastric bypass surgery and sleeve surgery, to drug treatments for type 2 diabetes in mildly obese individuals.
After obesity surgery, the average body mass index fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of those treated without surgery remained close to 29.
Diabetes was completely improved by 36% and in part by 28%.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and in part by only about 2%.
The study also found that blood pressure, triglycerides, and bad LDL cholesterol were better in the surgical group.
The researchers also followed the patients' hemoglobin-A1c levels, which describe the development of blood sugar levels.
According to the researchers, the recommended level of haemoglobin-A1c is less than 7%.
After surgery, haemoglobin-A1c decreased from an average of 9% to 6%.
In the group of drug-treated patients, the value remained unchanged at about 8%.
However, a team led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over a five-year period.
The team also compared the consequences of two different methods of surgery.
In the fifth year of the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher compared to the sleeve surgery group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), body mass index drop was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as were hemoglobin A1c levels (3.1 percent and 2.1 percent).
However, a Swedish study by Blackstone at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix found that surgery brings years of life to obese individuals.
In a Swedish study, the likelihood of mortality in fat individuals who underwent gastric bypass surgery over a 15-year period was reduced by 29% compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although the new study did not show a lower mortality rate, Blackstone did provide confirmation that individuals with a BMI of less than 35 could benefit from the procedure.
"This is the main finding of the study, as it says surgery is safe in the lower body mass index group and does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
Blackstone said people and doctors should take weight seriously when the body mass index is 27-30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes have accumulated in the human body that predispose to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and he says that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading figure in Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the refugee crisis during his visit to the United Kingdom, which gave its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity should be put ahead of individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that, while the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is an impossible idea for everyone to come to Europe," the Dalai Lama said in a speech.
Although the Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their actions in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Caring for thousands of refugees is a wonderful act, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions and how we will bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"We must, after all, consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
Power use must be reduced.
The force has never solved the problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama further commented on George Bush's actions in connection with the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming that, in resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the September 11 attacks, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that a solution will be made through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he resorted to force with unpredictable consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Hand sanitization cases quadrupled in children in four years
According to the Georgia Poisoning Center, poison control centers across the United States report nearly quadrupled cases of hand sanitization with high alcohol levels in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poisoning Center, cases of hand sanitizer ingestion reported to poison centers in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some children are put in emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez says children drink hand sanitizers on purpose, some to impress their friends, and some to be incited by social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant because of cheap hops.
Teenagers are reported to mix alcoholic mouthwash with disinfectant to make the drink even stronger.
Smaller children can be attracted by the smell of hand sanitizers.
"A child doesn't think that matter is bad," Lopez said.
"A large proportion of attractive hand sanitizers are just perfumed.
There are hand sanitizers with strawberry, grape and orange flavors that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength of disinfection agents is 45-95%.
For young children, a small amount can cause alcohol poisoning.
"Käsides has a very high alcohol content," Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Kansas University Hospital Poisoning Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a whiskey shot available to children, but if hand disinfection products are often left available to children, they will quickly provide a large amount of alcohol."
Nhaijah Russell, six, recently enjoyed four loras of strawberry-scented hand sanitizers at school, and the girl was delivered to the emergency room for treatment.
"The girl's blood alcohol level was 179, which is twice the adult's hop limit," said Chris Ritchey, a doctor who treated the girl at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah sopered and could not walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the girl's condition overnight in a separate children's hospital for brain damage, as the girl had fallen and hit her head after drinking alcohol," Ritchey said.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfection wipes in addition to the need to move your hands beyond the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought that the product contained lethal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter is indicated as the active substance in the product fiche.
According to a police report, three fourth grade students in northern New York State planned to kill an "evil" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizers and banned it from being brought into the classroom.
Police felt that the plan that had gone to death was meaningless and urged the school to take disciplinary action.

Dutch miss old Scottish battle couple - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer has stated that Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has stopped because they are no longer allowed to follow Celtic and Rangers' duels.
De Boer, who works for Ajax's team management, said, "There are no more highlights of Celtic games in Holland.
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"This is not just about the Rangers coming back.
We're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch need doubles between the teams.
Old Firm games have a huge tension and are also of interest outside the Scottish borders."
I turn the situation around, Deila assures
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a difficult time, but the Norwegian pilot assures that there will be a change in the situation.
The club that lost to Malmö fell out of the Champions League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had some difficult episodes before, and we're getting up again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it arouses anger or sadness in many.
So do we, but we must move on.
We desperately need the support of Celtic supporters, as it will strengthen players considerably.
The spirit of community is now really important."
Warburton cautious in January player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton hinted at January's player relocation targets, he is cautious about the transfer ruljanss and says he wants to jeopardize the team's unity.
"Tammikuu's player transfers differ significantly from summer moves," Brentford's ex-coach said.
"The players joining the team in the summer can be used to the team before the season starts, which has been successful in our line-up this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary player purchases can cause more harm to the team than good."
Michu, who is thinking about retirement in Celtic's sights
Swansea striker Michu has been associated with Celtic in player transfer speeches, while Michu has hinted at retirement after the Swans contract has ended.

Neilson, however, remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reprimanded when a man admitted to raving song words about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh local match at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming, and the atmosphere was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I won't go back to Tynecastle except in Celtic's ranks."

McInnes satisfied with Hamilton win with dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced to hold on to Hamilton for his seventh consecutive league win. With the win, Aberdeen grabbed a five-point neck to Celtic at the top of the league table. It is thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winning team that has not won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment unchanged in Scotland, growing in the British Isles
The number of unemployed remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July, with 164,000 unemployed, while the number of unemployed in the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9%, compared to 5.5% in the UK as a whole.
There are 12,000 fewer employed in Scotland than three months earlier, and the number of employed is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, with the average employment rate in the whole of the UK at 73.5%.
Scottish Affairs Minister David Mundell commented on the recent figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy."
Almost exactly a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penalty Prison when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses.
I was invited in January through a man's best friend and despite my shock, I responded yes to the call.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought this is how I could tell the true story of the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists have access to follow executions in the United States, and since there are more applications than places, participants are selected with a macabre draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of journalists from 12 to five.
The chosen ones follow the execution in moderation.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've created a personal relationship with a man, because we've been talking on the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
Prison staff say I can't be present as both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to take notes.
I just have to try to memorize the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of endangering neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you get close to him."
I gave my dissenting opinion to the reporter.
The journalist woman admitted that she could have worded her words more carefully, but still considers my actions wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he tries to order, I wouldn't.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will promote the anti-death penalty movement.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of aiding after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that the man Glossip has not committed the murder.
I absolutely believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
An impartial description can be read in other journalists' stories.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die for nothing.
Man lured from Canning River after watery police hunt
The Canning Vale area officer remained dry while attracting a man out of the Canning River.
The Persian man's escape attempt stopped in shallow, muddy water, and a police officer a few meters away was able to land the man back on dry land.
Canning Vale police received a call Tuesday for an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
Upon arrival, police detected a suspect who sought to shake off police by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he would not come out of the water and urged the police to get him into the water," senior sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not attracted by the irrigation of the uniform, so he chose a safer tactic — negotiation.
"Sometimes an escape attempt causes a person to resort to amusing means," Sergeant Castledine said.
The case of football champion Ben Cousins is a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid police blowing and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to design Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody said the officials were trying to spy, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody accuses Racing Victoria officials of spying on his stables last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been personally attacked by officials and Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tatai due to recent treatment on the day of the race was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to work for competitive sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when cobalt was found in Lidar's sample and the man was unable to explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue in check for espionage charges for a year and a half, and did not want the accusations to seem like the action of a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to bring it up, I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration erupts once and for all," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes I have to react and accept the consequences. I have to accept the space now after I opened my mouth.
I go home and sleep well at night.
I want to go upright, and I want horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I shouldn't be a horse coach anymore.
I would have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told of the integrity department spying attempts at his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job at my stable with the intention of spying on my actions. I'll tell him the man's name on request," Moody told Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they should present the evidence, as I have not been caught in anything unauthorized.
Robert Roulston, former RVL president, David Moodie, current RVL president, and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, were aware of the action then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and place responsibility for the situation in the field on non-trainers?
Am I a nuisance to the industry?
Am I really bad for the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'd still have a coaching license and push me away from my duties, and there's no doubt that what I'm saying will make many people think so.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I pressure them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
The long-standing Lidar cobalt rank investigation and recent rejection situation eventually made the coach frustrated so that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of unbeatable champion Black Caviar, who described the race day's treatment rule as ridiculous after a clay wrapper was placed at the horse's feet in violation of the rules.
"Treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"A person in my staff mistakenly put clay on the horse's foot.
Clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday day, and it did.
But it happened on race day."
Moody can expect a three-month ban on irregular clay treatment, which has been investigated by the organizers.
"This is a joke.
The rules were written by someone who doesn't know the horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Banned from Cobram crash site arrested
Police have arrested a man who ran into a cyclist this weekend and fled the crash site.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, which suffered serious injuries after a car crashed into him on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the man who drove the car fled the scene and did not stay to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to Shepparton Police.
The man is likely to be charged with failing to stop and assist in a traffic accident and other traffic violations.
A 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still hospitalized and is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refers to the wrestling speeches of opponents
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy sees criticizing his team's tackle game as a purpose-oriented action by NRL's two league favorites.
According to Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson, the judges let Storm wrestle in a qualifying match won by Melbourne hosts on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered up a reference to Storm after Broncos won the qualifying finals on the Saturday night of the Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and stated that Queensland is not particularly concerned about wrestling.
Bellamy defended her own team's tackle game and said they were just focused on contact when they tackled.
Bellamy added that her confidence in her own team was enhanced by the fact that two top team coaches criticized her team. Bellamy sees this as an indication that coaches are concerned about losing to Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I think Trent Robinson didn't say anything about wrestling when his team beat us 24-1," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you, we haven't changed anything in our defense system or techniques all year, and for the past six weeks, we've just invested in contact games and tackles that have turned us up.
Trent has been in his position for three years, and losing may have been a shock to him because he has a great team that's not used to losing.
It is amusing that the same thing always comes up at the same time of year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett on what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team from Saturday to our game on Friday and found their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"In 2010, St Georgea received a lot of criticism for his boring game. Wayne stated that the review won't bother him a bit.
Now he has a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast center attackers.
You want to play that kind of football when the player arsenal is like this.
He emphasized this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play in his style. Not all teams have central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they resort to this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more goals were scored in Storm and Roosters than in the Broncos and Cowboys encounter.
Broncos' game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20-18, and there were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are game breaks and low-goals interesting football?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we will probably face them."
Storm has a free weekend, as the team will be able to visit either the North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on the coming Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale on Tuesday morning.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail in drug case
A man awaiting a possible life sentence for a 40-pound cocaine attempt in Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after police found a 100-pound shipment of cocaine on a Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived at the port of Coomera in August.
Police watched Maximovic and an accomplice meet at the marina for the morning and later surprised the two at the Coomera Roadhouse.
Although Maximovicia is potentially awaiting life in possession of the drug for commercial purposes, the man's lawyer says there is no evidence that his client has tried to gain possession of the entire batch, but the man may have been in the cafe for innocent purposes.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan said there was a risk that Maximovic would try to flee the country.
"Maximovic clearly has links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maximovic's mother and stepfather together paid 200,000 bail against which the man was released.
"After reading the affidavits of both individuals, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"However, that alone is not enough to prevent a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders his passport to both Australia and Serbia, reports to the police daily, and stays home from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used her phone to get pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to get control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while the girl was sleeping and logged in to the online messaging service, where she got another user to send herself inappropriate pictures of the children.
Later, when she woke up, she noticed that the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
While browsing the contents of her phone, the girl found shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
After searching the computers found at the address, police found disturbing Internet searches using keywords to retrieve inappropriate child images.
Hogg claimed to police that he tried to mislead pedophiles on the Internet and played police with the intention of scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson stated at the local judiciary in Dundee Sheriff Court: "The man claimed to be dependent on scaring people.
He admitted to doing the searches on the computer, but claimed to have done so to play the police and thus scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the photos to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead pedophiles.
He said he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added, "After finding the messages on the phone, the girl shouted at her mother shaking and crying."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, after which Hogg was questioned.
The girl said the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than themselves.
Hogg Dundeen, 23, from Ward Road, confessed to charges of possession of inappropriate child images on June 14 last year. Hogg violated bail on January 25 this year and failed to appear for hearing on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be put on the sex offenders' register, as it can be considered that the crime did not include any significant sexual features.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October due to background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this matter, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sex offenders' register even before the date of the sentence.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives the wrong speech in parliament
Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell on the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also overshadowed by allegations by opposition party legislators that they have received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, MPs booed and suspended a speech on the situation of the President's state in parliament with interim calls, and the president gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), said seven opposition politicians received text messages urging them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that outside Parliament, representatives are no longer within the scope of immunity.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings operations for the business of corporate services.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will differentiate the computer and printer business from the faster growing business hardware and service operations.
HP reports that the company will record $2.7 billion in non-recurring expenses from the arrangements as of the fourth quarter.
"The restructuring will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP CEO, who will lead the company after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company than current HP, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that will help companies move into a new business style," Whitman said.
"As a company of our own, our position is better than ever and we are better able to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of over $50 billion and is focused on delivering unique integrated technology solutions to companies, according to its mission.
Founded in the 1930s by Stanford University breeders Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the company is now split in two. The two founded an electronics company in a garage in Palo Alto, which is now considered the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
There have been massive restructurings in HP as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
Changes from the world's second largest computer manufacturer and HP, one of the largest technology companies in the United States, are the latest move in a industry where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta: Team must support injured Jack Wilshere before meeting Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field as early as December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four English national team games, and knowing the history of the man, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest trouble with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided last season after a strong ankle injury and seemed to have returned to its former blade under the new season.
"Such an injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The bone didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Wenger said, additional injuries can occur when a player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant regularity here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different types of effort since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played only 65 of 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Arsenal's broader picture is that since the 2007-2010 season, for six of the eight seasons, the team has been the second of the teams to lose money due to the most injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believe, the improved injury statistics last season will continue to develop for the better.
"Sometimes post-injury return can involve a vulnerable period of time when you have to strengthen your body and apply for competitive advantages," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll get through this.
I hope he gets his body balanced, and I believe in it, and with it, his career continues as he deserves."
Arsenal will start their Champions League project on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. The team will then face Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the following Wednesday. Wenger is preparing minor changes to the lineup.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely starters.
Wenger can also put Kiera Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the starting lineup to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest time to those in need," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to continue the F Group, Maximir Zagreb has some of Europe's most terrifying stadiums.
Dinamo has also been invincible for 41 games of the team.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday night as the ground trembled at a intensity of 3.2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson last season after having to yield to Monaco, and is still motivated by the distant hope of piloting the team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"This title has not yet been hit by the arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, on the other hand, I am also realistic with experience.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines with its absence in other series. It is noteworthy, especially considering that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics for young men are at their highest in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death among men aged 20 to 65 in the UK, with suicide three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) tackles the problem by declaring 2015 Men's Year. The campaign aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
A recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students, and found that people with depressive symptoms have better chances of healing if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of developing asymptomatic persons was also halved if there were people in their immediate circle who did not have mental health problems.
But the basis of everything is friendships.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalization of life, the need seems strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
Superficial success is associated with outward values, money, image and social status. All of these distract attention from our inner values and inherent longing for personal growth and friendship. Internal values have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently stated that money can't really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends was that the series turned the focus on its head.
None of the characters in the series were defined by profession but by personality, which was reflected in friendships.
The show was humorously played by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often missing Rachel. It was clear that the men could relate to this, even though they don't refrain from feeling full.
One volunteer explained this to me: "When I listen to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often are unable to talk to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should do well is strong, and a man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frendit is one of those series that presents long-term coping mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Through the phone, I can offer help from outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support is provided from close friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central's FriendsFest, the set of the series has been brought to life. So if you are attending the event this weekend, it is worth taking friends for coffee to Central Perk.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship can become.
Comedy Central to broadcast the entire FriendsFest series - all 236 episodes - in honor of #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after scoring against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in his Champions League debut and helped PSG beat the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Read the game report and review.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the attack when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Champions League by hitting Malmö's Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored after less than four minutes of playing the debut game. He strengthened the position of the French masters right out of the box. However, PSG screwed up several goals before they could finally add their lead: Cavani painted after 60 minutes of playing the game.
The A-block also features Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG not only aims to continue in the playoffs, but also wants to improve its position for the quarterfinals in the three remaining games.
Although SPG captured the score, the match was not the perfect show for a team piloted by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his goal front spot and the man was put on exchange when he was up against his former home club, where he began his amazing career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win and good grip will give us a good foundation, even though we still had something to pet for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We were thirsty for victory and we could do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do one or two extra goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after the injury. The team had to settle for a 2-2 draw in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux this weekend. However, Di Maria overshadowed Ibrahimovic at four minutes.
Last month, the Argentine pier, which moved from Manchester United to PSG, was named the PSG solver, which takes the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of the appointment when he rushed the ball from Marco Verratt's pass past Malmö's defense and then triggered an accurate hit on the back corner of the goal past Johan Wiland.
However, those who were waiting for the PSG crush win were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched nine international players on the field from the start. The team playing with the tactics of five men's defenses and two attackers was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot was narrowly missed by Kevin Trapp's goal back post in the 34th minute of the game.
Instead, PSG succumbed to unnecessary pitching and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals in the first half alone. At the very beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's kick fed the goal to the backs of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his claws in the pitch game. From Ibrahimovic's pitch, Di Maria fired a twist kick past Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was scored in the Count's time thanks to Cavan, and a Uruguayan who played his sixth season shot a full hit when Ibrahimovic fed him the left winger Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's kiri ended at the second goal, and only Wiland's top defense of David Luiz's shot at close range kept the readings under control, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's goal from the bench was abandoned at the very end of the time.
Malmö pilot Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was in a class of its own. "We played the previous Champions League game in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
Qualifiers are not enough.
Hats off to Parisians.
This was a top game from them."
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share issue
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which was tested for raw material prices, raised US$2.5 billion in Wednesday's share issue as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that he sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to reduce debts.
The company's market value fell by 57 percent this year, wrestling with the price collapse of raw materials as the Chinese economic recession hampers demand and puts a strain on the market.
With the share issue, Glencore's stock price climbed to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday to begin the morning.
The share rose by 2.77% to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to an increase of 0.69%.
Glencore announced last week plans to raise $2.5 billion in stock issue as part of a strategy to reduce its $30 billion debt by a third.
The company sold new shareholders for 125 pence, which is 2.4 per cent of the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares with a total value of up to 9.99% of the total group.
Concerns about the continued recession in the Chinese economy have caused the price of iron ore to collapse by half, while the decline in coal, copper and other commodities has been 20-40%.
White House confirms visit to Washington by Xi Jinping
A White House communication on Tuesday confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States for a state visit at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives for his first official visit to Washington on September 25, a counter-visit after President Barack Obama visited Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions between heads of state, U.S. President and President's wife Michelle Obama arrange dinners for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan to celebrate a state visit.
"The visit by President Xi Jinping will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral topics of interest to both sides. At the same time, President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity for constructive discussions on topics of disagreement," the White House said in a statement.
Xi Jinping's visit was first announced in February and is expected to stop by Seattle to meet several American technology leaders. From Seattle, the president's journey would continue first to Washington and then to New York to the UN General Assembly on September 28.
Obama and Xi are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and the country's increased efforts in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon had a heated conversation with African-American Effie Brown and stated that diversity was not needed behind the camera.
In an episode of HBO's Project Greenlight series on Sunday night, the experienced actor interrupted Brown when he explained the importance of taking into account different views on the black protagonist of the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is taken into account in the casting of the film, not in the casting of the program," Damon claimed.
Brown snorted stunned and injured by the claim. "Wow, clear," the woman noted that Damon, who starred in Mars alone, after a comment.
Damon and Brown were gathered with other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever the director is, I'd like to encourage you to think about how Harmony's character will be portrayed," Brown said at first.
"The only black character is a prostitute who has sex with her white pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon harshly replied that the two's choice could lead to an unwanted outcome.
When the conversation was aired on television, social media exploded from Damon's disapproving comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the scene in direct words: "The fact that Matt Damon talks on the only black person to explain what diversity is is so white that it hurts."
The tweet was distributed over 5,000 times and liked 4,000 times.
Damon's comments coincide with the time when equal representation of human races in the media is the number one topic.
After teenage Michael Brown died from a white police bullet in 2014. The Black Lives Matter movement gained support throughout the country, seeking to stop discriminatory treatment of legislators and public authorities black people.
In February, singer Prince referred to the movement when she introduced the album nominees of the year at the Grammys.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and the lives of black people, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fow News' Elisabeth Hasselbeck question about whether that group should be described as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love-based group," the movement's management said.
Damon is one of those entertainers, producers and media moguls who has been invited to the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known if Damon has answered the invitation in the affirmative.
American Ninja Warrior series first winner
Professional climber and dish collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior title on Monday and signed for $1 million for his win.
In the seventh season just ended in the TV series, all the tasks assigned were cleared for the first time.
In the final episode of the season, Caldiero and photographer Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
In the final task, men had to climb up the 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten cleared the position in the first given time. He was the first competitor to complete the fourth phase of the American Ninja Warrior race approved. However, Caldiero performed the position three seconds faster and became the winner.
After a hard fight, Caldiero told E!News he was still in shock after catching a million-dollar pot.
"The winning amount is incredible, as I've never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in an interview with E! about his winning pot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's going to happen, the future is just open."
Executive producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor to have figured out all the missions.
"The rules say the fastest wins the prize money.
If more competitors figure out all the tasks, the fastest wins," Weed explained.
"The money prize is wonderful and will revolutionize life, but Britten will also get satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he'll stay and brood about it any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He has received a lot of praise from fans.
Britten is a great guy for whom family is important.
His children and his wife consider him a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he preferred to win for Isaac.
He also believes Isaac would have thought the same of him if the situation had been different."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth season, with filming starting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers squeezed victory over Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The Detroit Tigers have no particularly nice experiences in the second half of the season.
Tigers, one of Baseball's best teams, is now in the last place in American League Central.
However, the team succeeded on Tuesday by hitting the Minnesota Twins at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to stand up to the Houston Astros to fight for another wild card slot in the playoffs.
Detroit returned, though only for one night, to the taste of victory, which has been behind the stone in the second half of the season.
"Every win is nice, however it is achieved," Tigers pilot Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon held out when Detroit succeeded three times in the first two innings, once in the sixth and again in the ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 shifts in a good game and let three runs.
He has only had three good beginnings on nine outside shifts.
"I just want to end the season strongly this year," Simon said.
"It's hard for an alternative player to throw in every game, and that's why I want to pass until the sixth shift."
Tigers pitcher substitute Victor Martinez scored three hits and hit two runs, his first run since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first night of three hits since he received four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He hit well," Ausmus said.
"He looks good in batting exercises and kept the tune in the game."
In the second turn of the seventh inning, Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
The middle cop Byron Buxton started the shift with a two-basin hit with a stroke near the left sideline.
The real catcher Aaron Hicks beat the sacrifice, and Simon took the turn of second Brian Dozier, who took three direct passes before he was replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Herdy got a time off for Mauer, and the newcomer pitcher's surrogate Miguel Sano hit two nests, and after him came the right-handed Drew VerHagen.
When there were two runners on the field, VerHagen got a three Trevor Plouffen to burn two players.
The Major League team led the 27th time this season when Plouffe burned two players.
After Detroit had completed the verification run on the first shift of the ninth shift, Tigers finisher Bruce Rondon struck a two-run beat, and the score was 5 to 5.
However, the right-handed pitcher threw three direct passes and was able to keep his team in position.
Detroit took advantage of the fact that Phil Hughes was a little rusty.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-handed veteran who had just gotten back from the injured list to the fields.
"Of course, the beginning wasn't what I would have liked. However, as the game progressed, I started to feel more comfortable, and I was able to make a good performance and a few good assists in the third innings," Hughes said.
After taking the lead, Hughes gave one nest a hit to the second Ian Kinsler in the first inning.
The real catcher J.D. Martinez's free slice brought Victor Martinez the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 tube was cut off when the team had players on the nests.
Nick Castellanos of three was next hit by one nest, one run, but Victor Martinez burned down trying to advance to three.
Tigers increased their lead in the second innings, and kidnapper James McCann survived the hit to second base and Anthony Gose to first base, when the score was 3-0.
"A strange hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but the punch hit the right spot."
The pitcher was Hughes, who pitched a pointless third inning, after which he was traded to his right-handed surrogate A.J. Achter.
Hughes' balance was three runs, six hits, a free slice and four direct passes.
Notable: Tigers right-handed batter Anibal Sanchez was not involved in the lineup due to the tear of the batting shoulder.
The shoulder is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list due to shoulder rupture since mid-August, and was scheduled to be included on Wednesday.
When Sanchez doesn't play, left-handed batter Daniel Norris leaves the injured list and is in the starting lineup against the Twins.
Norris has been given 1-1 in four games since he was traded for his left-handed batter David Pricee on July 30.
He has been out of line-up since August 20 due to a slanted abdominal rupture.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running average: 4.43) is met by Minnesota right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, running average: 4.73).
